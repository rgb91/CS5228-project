639||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###640||It sounds like a plot from a movie: a train carrying tons of cargo barreling out of control and a mission to stop it.

Such discrepancies can lead the Fed to reject plans to pay out capital to shareholders.

Stress-test projections released by the Fed and U.S. firms showed Goldman Sachs predicted its Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of the firm’s ability to absorb losses, would be 3.9 percentage points higher than what the Fed estimated in a worst-case scenario. New York-based Citigroup calculated a ratio 3 percentage points stronger than the central bank’s figure.

The Fed’s test measures how well banks can weather economic turmoil, before the regulator signals in a second stage whether firms can proceed with proposed dividends and stock buybacks. While figures released by the central bank showed that 29 of the 30 largest U.S. lenders could withstand a deep recession, Fed officials have said they’ll also consider the quality of banks’ processes when approving or rejecting proposed payouts. That announcement is set for March 26.

“If the bank really appears to be an outlier relative to the Fed test it has to speak to their own capital-planning process,” Todd Hagerman, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. “If one of those companies had a fairly wide disparity between its own model and the Fed’s model, that’s going to raise red flags.”

Revising Plans

Last year, the large banks whose figures split most from the Fed’s -- Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- were forced to submit new capital plans to address weaknesses in their processes. The New York-based firms were allowed to continue payouts in the meantime. While the regulator posted results for every bank in this year’s first round, not all of them released their own calculations yesterday for comparison.

JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, estimated this time that its Tier 1 common ratio would fall to a level that differed by only 0.2 percentage point from the Fed’s estimate. Bank of America Corp.’s figure was more optimistic than the Fed’s by 2.6 percentage points. Morgan Stanley’s gap was 2 percentage points. Wells Fargo & Co.’s was 1.5 percentage points.

Preventing Crisis

“We think there is some possibility that BAC may have to resubmit its capital-return request,” Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research note, referring to Bank of America’s stock symbol. He cited the firm’s “differential” from the Fed as a reason.

Spokesmen for all six lenders declined to comment. Analysts estimate that the 23 publicly traded banks in this year’s tests can afford to pay out more than $75 billion in excess capital to investors if the Fed signs off on their plans.

The Fed tests are designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. created a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout program for banks.

Firms in this year’s tests must describe what would happen to capital ratios, revenue and loss rates on various assets in dire scenarios described by the Fed. Eight of the biggest banks also must demonstrate they can handle the sudden demise of their trading partner with the potential for greatest losses.

‘Collectively Better’

Yesterday’s results show big U.S. banks “are collectively better positioned to continue to lend to households and businesses and to meet their financial commitments in an extremely severe economic downturn than they were five years ago,” the Fed said in a statement. “This result reflects continued broad improvement in their capital positions since the financial crisis.”

The central bank tested firms under two scenarios. Its “adverse” case gauges what would happen to the value of their existing holdings of riskier commercial loans should yields rise as high as 9.2 percent in this year’s third quarter. In the Fed’s “severely adverse” environment, the unemployment rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks into recession.

Each party uses its own model to produce estimates of losses and capital ratios, which can vary.

“Because we employ models and methodologies developed by us, our results will differ, potentially significantly, from projections that the Federal Reserve will make,” San Francisco- based Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, wrote in a presentation of its figures.

The Fed can object on quantitative grounds, such as insufficient capital, or on qualitative grounds if it finds that a company’s planning processes or controls are flawed.

‘Drawing Board’

“Qualitative relates to quality — if the Fed sees anything funky in the capital plans they reserve the right to send them back to the drawing board,” Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who founded NAB Research LLC in New Jersey, said in a phone interview. “That’s healthy.”

The Fed’s assumptions are so conservative that the banks’ findings can be more realistic in some cases, said R. Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. While a “huge gap” could affect next week’s results, many things can determine whether banks win approval, he said in an interview.

Zions Bancorporation was the only lender projected by the Fed to fall below one of the main capital thresholds. The Salt Lake City-based firm’s Tier 1 common ratio would drop to as low as 3.5 percent in a severely adverse scenario, short of the 5 percent minimum used when approving capital plans in the test’s second stage, the Fed said.

‘Severely Adverse’

Zions, which is participating in the stress tests for the first time, said earlier this year that it will refile its capital plan because a sale of some securities cut risk. Yesterday, the firm said the next submission also will include additional actions to ensure it meets the Fed’s requirements.

Among the six largest U.S. lenders, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came closest to the regulatory minimum across the five ratios being tested.

The Fed found that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America’s Tier 1 leverage ratio would fall to as low as 4.6 percent under the “severely adverse” scenario. The same ratio at Morgan Stanley would fall to 4.7 percent. The regulatory minimum stands at 4 percent.

‘Safe, Strong’

Such close margins don’t necessarily mean a firm’s capital plan is in jeopardy. Bank of America’s more-than $2.1 trillion in average total assets at the end of last year indicate it could return about $13 billion to investors without falling below the leverage threshold. The lender, which ranks as the nation’s second-largest bank, may have requested an average $7.2 billion over the next 12 months, according to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Morgan Stanley’s more-than $830 billion of total assets show it can return almost $6 billion before falling below the minimum. The New York-based firm, which owns the world’s biggest brokerage, may have asked to return $2.1 billion, the analysts’ estimates show.

While the Fed didn’t list asset totals for the banks, it said assets for the 30 firms combined climb during the next two years in the severely adverse scenario.

Next week, the banks also must show what capital levels would look like after taking into account their plans for acquisitions, higher dividends and stock buybacks.

“The financial system is safe and strong and the capital base is growing,” said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s financial-regulation practice. “The average person who relies on the banking system should be happy. Next week will tell us whether banks and bank shareholders will be happy.”###642||NEW YORK: The safe-haven yen fell broadly on Monday after the United States and the European Union imposed what investors perceived to be modest economic sanctions on some officials of Russia and Ukraine following Crimea's vote to join Moscow over the weekend.

Although investors are not ruling out another flare-up in tensions between Russia and Ukraine, many do not expect contagion to major markets. The lack of military conflict between the two countries has also appeased investors.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

As a result, the United States on Monday announced sanctions on 11 Russians and Ukrainians blamed for Russia's military incursion into Crimea, including two top aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel to the 11 individuals named as responsible for the Russian move into Crimea.

The European Union, meanwhile, is to impose sanctions including asset freezes and travel bans on 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine after Crimea applied to join Russia on Monday, Lithuania's foreign minister said.

“The sanctions don't sound particularly aggressive,” said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York. “Also some of the worst case scenarios they were anticipating over the weekend, such as actual military engagement, did not really materialize.”

In mid-morning trading, the dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 101.76 yen, rising after four days of losses as investors had bought the safe-haven Japanese currency in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The euro also gained 0.6 percent to 141.83 yen, and climbed against the dollar as well to $1.3941, despite a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

Europe's common currency has traded within a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when ECB President Mario Draghi voiced concerns about the euro's strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn't weakened substantially,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also struggled on Monday as risk appetite improved. The euro was up 0.1 percent versus the franc at 1.2152.###643||You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

One thing that’s made with superior spit and finesse in the U.S. is the spirit of luring customers from the competition. And so it is that even as Walmart ramps up its patriotic advertising campaign — as Marketing Daily’s Sarah Mahoney reports this morning — it is also setting out to steal market share from GameStop and lesser entities that deal in the rapidly expanding cosmos of used videogames.

advertisement advertisement

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

In advance of that “announcement,” Walmart executives told reporters on a call yesterday that it is partnering with CExchange — which already handles its smartphone and tablet trade-in program and also works with the likes of Microsoft, RadioShack and eBay — to administer the program.

“The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online,” Evan Narcisse reports on Kotaku.

“The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older,” writes CNNMoney’s Parija Kavilanz.

Walmart estimates consumers shell out $2 billion annually buying used games. It says “extra cash from used games will give customers money to spend on newer ones, which typically cost about $60 apiece,” Ian Sherr and Shelly Banjo report in the Wall Street Journal.

But that “extra cash” comes in the form of Walmart gift cards that customers cannot spend at McDonald’s — or whatever mom-and-pop survives down Central Ave. — creating a self-perpetuating profit scenario. The other part of the economics of the program is a no-brainer.

“It’s extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson tells Wingfield.

But Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton says it’s just focusing on its customers’ wants and needs. “We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Mac Naughton told reporters on the call yesterday.

He added that “the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ‘inflection point’ following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year,” Andrea Cheng reports on Market Watch.

“There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment,” says Mac Naughton.

GameStop, which “has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year,” as the Dallas Morning News’ Maria Halkias writes, seems almost nonchalant about the wolf at its door. Its “retail network and family of brands include 6,488 company-operated stores in 15 countries worldwide and online at www.GameStop.com,” according to its investor relations site.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” it said in a statement reacting to the Walmart news. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Citing the complexity successfully executing a trade-in business model, GameStop CEO Paul Raines tells the WSJ’s Sheer and Banjo, “We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time.”

Indeed, Walmart has played and lost at a beta of this game. It tested a program in 2009 “that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud,” Heather Somerville reports in the San Jose Mercury News. It shut the program down and “has since been working to create a simpler and fairer” system.

If there one thing we all know about the tech market, it’s that yesterday’s hits are today’s giveaways. Asked about the growth of downloadable gaming, Mac Naughton told GameSpot’s Eddie Makuch that Walmart “isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many,” although it has it eyes fixed on the game even as it changes.

“We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,” he said. “We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.”###646||Empty###647||Empty###648||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- After less than two years at Symantec's (SYMC) helm, the software maker terminated CEO Steve Bennett on Thursday, a shock move that has sent its shares spiraling.

Analysts were surprised by the decision, warning it bodes badly for Symantec's turnaround effort. Shares of the security and storage specialist were off 10.07% at $18.80 in pre-market trading. Symantec's stock is down 14.81% over the last 12 months.



WATCH: Symantec Shares Suffer After Third CEO Shakeup in Five Years

FBR Capital Markets Analyst Daniel Ives described Bennett's termination as "jaw dropping" in a note released on Friday. "Despite a few speed bumps fundamentally over the past few quarters, and March guidance below expectations, we believe Mr. Bennett was viewed as key to the turnaround story at Symantec, and we think this abrupt changing of the guard could potentially lead some investors to throw in the "white towel" as it represents a big step backward in the company's recovery process," he wrote.

Bennett's termination marks the company's third CEO change in just over five years. Former Intuit (INTU) CEO Bennett took the company's reins from Enrique Salem in July 2012, vowing to revitalize the company, which has long been criticized for poor execution. In January 2013 he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

"While Mr. Bennett had only unveiled his new strategic direction for Symantec in January 2013, it appears the board was expecting a faster transition toward improved market positioning and growth, an Everest-like challenge, in our view, after years of missteps (e.g., acquisitions, execution issues)," wrote FBR Capital Markets' Ives.

During an interview in November, Bennett told TheStreet that he had underestimated the impact of the company's massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his Symantec turnaround plan.

Bennett's termination prompted Jefferies to downgrade Symantec to 'hold' on Friday. "Following the abrupt CEO change, uncertainty around the direction and timeline for the next phase of the strategy will grow," wrote Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz, in a note. "The CEO change comes at a time when the implementation of the new strategic direction is still fairly early and follows several other senior management departures."

Schwartz added that deterioration in Symantec's morale and execution is a risk, citing the company's "uncertain" strategic and operational direction.

Michael Brown has been appointed as Symantec's interim president and CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement for Bennett. Brown, the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, joined Symantec following its merger with Veritas in 2005.

Bennett was the architect of Symantec's so-called "5/30 plan" - a roadmap to achieve 5% revenue growth and a 30% margins target by fiscal year 2017 that forms the cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.

Symantec reiterated its commitment to the 5/30 plan in the statement announcing Bennett's departure, and also reconfirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, has warned that the CEO's termination further jeopardizes the 5/30 plan, and lowered its Symantec price target to $17 from $18 on Friday. "Our new $17 PO is based on a 15% probability the 5/30 plan will go as planned (vs 25% previously), given our lower level of confidence following the termination of the CEO," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan.

The Frenchman, who was hired from French luxury goods group Hermes in 2011, has been under pressure regarding his pricing tactics and has had a difficult two years as Mulberry CEO.

He planned to take the handbag brand more upmarket but was hit by substantial discounts from competitors over Christmas and rising leather prices. The firm recently lost wholesale orders from Korea which hit profits.

Guillon has advised the board of his intention to step down with immediate effect.

Mulberry‘s former chief executive, Godfrey Davis, will take over until a replacement is found for Mr Guillon.

“I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,” Mr Davis said in a statement on Thursday.

“He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.”###653||Rhode Island had highest unemployment rate in the U.S. in January with a rate of 9.2 percent, according to the latest data from U.S. Bureau of labor Statistics.

(Journal Staff)###654||With Colorado legalizing marijuana for recreational use, making it legal to grow up to six plants for an individual, other states are looking at getting on the weed wagon. Many already are, decriminalizing possession of smaller amounts of pot, as well as legalization for medical purposes.

Sales in Colorado have been stellar, and the state is reaping the benefits, big time. In the first month alone, licensed dispensaries hit a whopping $14 million dollars in sales, and the state received a cool $2 million of those proceeds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) recently announced that he expects that the combined sales from both legal medical and recreational marijuana in the state will reach nearly $1 billion in the next fiscal year — about $600 million of that is projected to come from just recreational sales. The state stands to collect at least $134 million in taxes and fees.

And then there is big tobacco, with companies seeing a serious decline in sales in the U.S., are forced to turn their markets to other countries, and pushing their deadly fares in China, Russia and India, to name a few. Smokers in the US have dropped to less than half of the people who smoked in the 1950’s. Smokers are becoming a thing of the past. It is a known fact that tobacco kills and as such, many states have banned smoking in any public buildings or structures.

With the popularity of tobacco declining, and the popularity of marijuana on the rise, following the medical marijuana legalization in 20 states and recreational legalization in Colorado and Washington, and at least 58 percent of Americans agreeing that it should be legalized, it appears pot already has replaced tobacco smoking in America, and the tobacco industry would be crazy not to get on board.

With all of this cash to be made from an alternative smoking product, why not? However, when the largest tobacco company in the U.S., Philip Morris, was asked the question about the future intentions of its company, spokesman Bill Phelps told CBS: “We have a practice of not commenting or speculating on future business. Adding, tobacco companies are in the business of manufacturing and marketing tobacco products.”

But one can rest assured, if governments continue to treat smoking as the public health menace it is, the tobacco industry may not have a future at all, at least in the U.S. And as marijuana popularity continues to grow, thereby inadvertently replacing tobacco products, it could save their imminent decline, so it makes perfect sense.

But there is another entity that could take the marijuana boom to a new level, and that is the liquor industry.

The Washington State Liquor Control Board is receiving plenty of applications from people who want to be certified to be able to grow pot legally, even though the agency is not yet soliciting such applications. The agency’s spokesman Brian Smith said Tuesday that some applications so far have come from people who have long been growing marijuana when it was against state law.

“We’re getting a lot of interest from people that want to be producers,” Smith said. “Some say they have been growing it illegally until now.”

Where pot will go commercially is still unknown, but it is bound to happen soon.

Walmart said that it was launching a video game trade-in program, in which the big box retailer will go after the $2 billion used video game market.

Starting March 26, approximately 3,100 U.S. Walmart stores will begin accepting video game trade-ins. The traded-in games will be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition both online and in stores. The video games will be labeled "Certified Pre-Owned," which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition, Walmart says.

"We're going to shake up the market place," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., in a conference call with reporters. "We're not participating in the $2 billion used gaming industry at all."

The move will place pressure on Best Buy (BBY)and Amazon (AMZN), but it will especially hit GameStop as the Grapevine, Texas-based company formed a niche selling video games and gaming hardware.

"This WMT news will very likely represent the latest worry for GME investors and make for another weight upon shares at least near term. WMT is retailing's '800 lb. gorilla,' and we cannot discount any of its moves," Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel wrote in a note to clients.

That said, any "buy-sell-trade" model is "notoriously difficult for even seasoned retail chains to execute," Nagel said. "GME has been successful in the business for a long time. We are very hesitant to discount meaningfully the dominance of GME in the category, even against WMT. The market has worried that used video games might become the next 'dinosaur' in consumer products. We view WMT's move into the category as a validation of the category's longevity." Oppenheimer's Nagel rates GameStop at a "outperform."###660||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Security software developer Symantec Corp. gave the boot to Chief Executive Steve Bennett as the company’s turnaround appears to be taking longer than expected.

In a statement earlier on Thursday, Symantec did not offer much of an explanation.

“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec,” board chairman Daniel Schulman said. “We remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.” He added that the decision “was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

Symantec Outgoing Symantec CEO Steve Bennett.

Two and a half weeks ago, Bennett, who was appointed CEO in July 2012, told a Morgan Stanley Technology Conference that he planned to tell the board at an upcoming retreat that the company’s turnaround targets were still “very doable.” Perhaps the board thinks Symantec SYMC, +2.67% should be hitting its targets sooner.

“We’re going to have a tough year on margin expansion next year and revenue growth just [because of] the economics of the model, but we’re very excited about 2016 and 2017,” Bennett said earlier this month. He will be replaced on an interim basis by board member Michael Brown.

The developer of such products as Norton Antivirus software has been hit hard by the PC market’s steady decline. It has also struggled with a shift in the software industry to software as a service, or to a subscription model, versus the one-time licensing cost. Symantec will report its fiscal fourth-quarter results May 7.

Bennett had told the Morgan Stanley conference that the only way the company could meet the current profit margin target was through more cost cuts. “We took out about $200 million this year. I’m not going to do that again next year.”

Sounds like there might have been some disagreement about strategy or his approach to the turnaround. But will another CEO be able to move any faster without making more big cuts as well?

Investors were not pleased with the news, driving Symantec’s shares down over 6%.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3 per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: " After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit".

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: " The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the "heads" side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: "The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency."

Get caught up on all of the informative, inspiring and interesting reads###664||The familiarity of a £1 coin nestling in your trouser pocket will soon be a thing of the past when chancellor George Osborne announces a replacement for the high-value in today’s budget.

Introduced just 30 years ago the coin has been beset by mass counterfeiting, undermining confidence in the currency and forcing the Royal Mint to respond with a new, more elaborate, design to beat the forgers.

In its place will come a 12-sided dual metal coin, described as the ‘most secure’ in the world.

To be introduced from 2017 it will feature the Queen’s head on one side with a public competition set to be staged to determine what artwork adorns the reverse.

Estimates published by the Royal mint suggest as many as 45m £1 coins currently in circulation are forgeries.###665||Empty###666||Empty###667||Page not found

Florida lost 2,600 jobs in January, led by workforce drops in retail, hotels, restaurants and healthcare.

The reversal came even as the state's unemployment rate continued to fall, dropping from an upwardly adjusted 6.3 percent in December to 6.1 percent in January.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who is in Orlando this morning, announced the news via a Twitter link to a brief YouTube video. In the clip, he touted that unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since June 2008. But Scott made no mention of the retraction in jobs.

The unemployment rate and jobs numbers don't always mesh, in part because they're drawn from two different surveys. The jobless rate is taken from a household survey measuring people who say they either have a job or are actively looking for one. The jobs number comes from employers.

(NYSE: GME) has had a challenging time from attacks on its business on all fronts — online sales, freemium games versus premium games, and big-box retail efforts. Now its shares were getting bruised on Tuesday on news that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is directly targeting the GameStop model with a new push with its trade-in service and preowned game offerings.

Walmart said in its press release that it wants to offer the 110 million-plus gamers in the United States a new way to unlock value in their current purchases and to save on video game spending. Walmart said:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

Walmart even said that it is “actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity.” And as far as the GameStop targeting, the company may not have been named directly but Walmart said:

When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.

What matters here is that some 3,100 stores will participate, and even more importantly that the credit can be used on the purchase of any merchandise at Walmart and Sam’s stores. GameStop’s used vide game turn-in credit for customers is for GameStop purchases.

As far as what the market thinks about the new competition, it isn’t pretty. GameStop shares were down more than 5% and were still down closer to 4.4% at $38.00 on last look.

GameStop shares have traded in a 52-week range of $24.89 to $57.74, and the consensus price target prior to this news was just above $50.00.

So, can GameStop survive this effort? Most likely yes, but with some pain and competition.###671||Empty###672||A coalition of retail groups are in dismay over a decision by a federal appeals court that upheld the US Federal Reserve's cap on the amount of fees banks could charge on businesses for handling debit card transactions. The current cap is an average of $0.24 per transaction. The Houston Chronicle said that retail merchants had deemed the cap too high.

The ruling, which was issued by the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia on Friday, reversed a lower court decision which was in favor of the retail groups. The retail groups reportedly sued the Fed for setting the cap, which is actually a US Congress mandate stemming from a financial regulatory overhaul in 2010. Before the overhaul, the transaction was initially set at an average of $0.44 per debit card swipe. The Chronicle noted that the Fed proposed a $0.12 transaction fee. When the transaction fee doubled when it was passed and implemented, the retail groups claimed that the federal agency had buckled under the pressure from bank lobbyists. The plaintiffs have argued that the Fed factored banks' expenses into the cap that the law had not allowed, which was a clear deviation to the intention of the 2010 overhaul.

The Chronicle said banks had been lobbying to increase the original proposed cap of the Fed and explained that the federal agency overlooked the cost of handling the debit card transactions, maintenance and fraud prevention. In late 2011, there were attempts on banks to recoup the said costs by charging their debit card customers monthly fees. Public uproar over the monthly fees led for the said banks to drop the charges, The Chronicle said.

In a statement, plaintiff the National Retail Federation said following the Appeals decision that it will be reviewing the court ruling and will mull over its decision on whether to appeal it. Senior vice president and general counsel Mallory Duncan said on behalf of the group, "NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress. The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks."###673||Empty###674||Empty###675||Access to micro-blogging site Twitter is now blocked in Turkey. This comes after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's push for a ban of social media network.

"We will wipe out Twitter. I don't care what the international community says," he told followers at a rally in the run-up to March 30 local elections. Everyone could expect to see Turkey's strength, he added while drumming up support in the northwestern city of Bursa on Thursday (20.03.2014).

According to Turkish newspaper "Hürriyet," Erdogan's press department issued a statement shortly afterward to explain the prime minster's decree. Twitter had "ignored" Turkish court orders to remove certain links after Turkish citizens had filed complaints. On Friday (21.03.2014), Turkish newspaper "Radikal" published a statement by the public prosecutor's office which said that there was no court order to block Twitter.

Shortly after the ban was imposed, Turkish President Abdullah Gul made headlines by strongly criticizing the decision to block the platform. "One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms," Gul tweeted, clearly circumventing the ban. "I hope this implementation won't last long."

Gul, a frequent user of social media, has been critical of Erdogan's censorship moves long before - he chafed at the beginning of March when Erdogan demanded YouTube and Facebook be blocked. "YouTube and Facebook are recognized platforms all over the world. A ban is out of the question," Gul said at the time.

Criticism continues online, despite the ban

According to market researchers GlobalWebIndex, around 40 percent of Turkish Internet users are registered on Twitter. After the ban was imposed, shortly after midnight, people turned to other social media platforms such as Facebook to vent about the Erdogan administration.

Turkey's president has criticized Erdogan's move and says Twitter should not be blocked

"It's such a shame to have Erdogan as prime minister. I fear he is going to shut down the entire country," a Facebook user wrote. "My beloved democratic country! After the elections you are going to block Facebook as well. These messages are the last bits of our freedom," another posted. People also drew comparisons to other countries where Twitter is blocked. "What countries are blocking Twitter? Yes indeed, Turkey is now on the same level as China," a Facebook user wrote.

Shortly after the ban was imposed, people began sharing tips via cell phone apps and videos on how to circumvent the ban by changing one's DNS settings to allow access to Twitter. "It took me two minutes to change the DNS settings; I can now use Twitter again," a Facebook user wrote. This trick was picked up by millions of other Twitter users. Just a few hours after Twitter was blocked, hashtags like #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #TurkeyBlockedTwitter were top of the global hashtag ranks.

Despite the ban, members of the Turkish government have continued to tweet as well - like Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc who announced that Erdogan's Justice and Development Party's (AKP) election campaign would be in the province of Manisa on Friday. "Arinc uses Twitter for his daily election campaign? Now I'm confused. Why then block the site at all?" a user complained.

Social media pressures Erdogan

Erdogan's fight against Twitter started last year when protests in Istanbul's Gezi Park were in full swing. He publicly called the platform a "menace," stressing again and again that Twitter was distributing lies. In the past year, Twitter has been used as the main means of communication for millions of demonstrators in Turkey. Mass protests were widely organized via the service.

People in Turkey have to resort to tricks to be able to access Twitter

But Erdogan and his government have increasingly come under pressure - more so after a corruption scandal involving the Erdogan administration was unveiled in mid-December. Since then, alleged telephone conversations between Erdogan and his son Bilal were leaked and published on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. In these conversations, Erdogan reportedly told his son to hide huge sums of money. It's still unclear to this date who is responsible for publishing these recordings. Erdogan has accused a parallel state led by US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, a former political ally of Erdogan.

Media expert Asli Tunc of Istanbul's Bilgi University told DW that shutting down Twitter doesn't make sense. "It's very hard to fight such technology. There will be software and programs that help people circumvent the ban," she said. The Turkish government blocked YouTube a couple of years ago, but even back then there had been many possibilities to circumvent the ban.

Amnesty International has also strongly criticized the ban and called on the Turkish government to immediately reinstate access to Twitter. "The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on Internet freedom and freedom of expression," Amnesty International said in a statement.###676||Airbnb, the online home-rental marketplace, is in talks to raise funding from private equity firms that would value the company at a sturdy $10bn.

Those kind of valuations are par for the course for today's net startups really, but it's still a strong vote of confidence for a company that's facing legal issues over its business model.

Sources told the Wall Street Journal and Reuters that TPG Capital Management was leading the funding round, which could net the firm more than $400m.

Airbnb makes its money by taking a fee on private rentals, either where a homeowner rents out a room in their house to holidaymakers or where there rent out entire apartments, such as holiday apartments they own that are vacant the rest of the year. The trouble comes when tenants start to rent out rooms and flats they're renting, running the risk of falling foul of subletting laws.

Just like fellow so-called "sharing economy" startup Uber, which lets people share rides in cars and hire out vehicles, Airbnb has run into trouble at home in the US. In New York, tenants are prohibited from renting out their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present at the time and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has subpoenaed Airbnb for data on its hosts in the area to figure out if they broke the law.

The company's home town, San Francisco, is also looking into the legality of short-term rentals after tenancy advocates claimed the service was driving up rent prices and stripping the market of supply.

Airbnb argues that their hosts are mostly at home for the rentals so they're not illegal and says that the service helps people to pay their rent and generates revenue for local economies.

Earlier this year, the firm claimed that it was generating £502m in economic activity in the UK and supported 11,629 jobs.

“With Airbnb, more people are earning the extra money they need to pay their bills or pursue their dreams,” chief exec and co-founder Brian Chesky said.

But critics say that people are running illegal, highly profitable businesses by renting and then subletting many empty apartments at once - and avoiding hotel and rental-related taxes in the process. ®

Airbnb could raise between $400 million and $500 million in a round that would value the company at $10 billion, making it among the most valuable online startups in the world, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people who claim to have knowledge of the company's plans. If completed, the round would be the first for Airbnb since 2012 when the company raised cash on a $2.5 billion valuation.

By Neil Maidment and Kate Holton

LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Bruno Guillon has quit as chief executive of British luxury brand Mulberry, bringing an end to a two-year tenure marked by three profit warnings during an attempt to move upmarket that has failed to pay off.

Under Guillon, Mulberry hiked prices in an effort to become more exclusive and win back customers who were upgrading to pricier brands. But, like others in the market, it has been taken by surprise by the arrival of aspirational brands at the lower end of the luxury range, such as Michael Kors.

At the end of January, it was forced to cut profit forecasts for the third time in 18 months, after weak demand in South Korea and heavy discounting over Christmas in Britain which contributes 65 percent of sales.

“The board agreed that it was now time to part company,” a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Mulberry, which makes Bayswater and Alexa handbags that sell for up to 4,500 pounds, said Frenchman Guillon would leave immediately, without saying if he would receive any payoff.

The warning wiped over 25 percent off Mulberry’s shares in January, a loss from which they are yet to recover. Analysts see little short-term benefit from Mulberry’s growth strategy that requires investment at a time of slowing sales.

The firm’s efforts to become a global brand were also dealt a heavy blow last September when the highly-rated Emma Hill, creative director behind the Alexa and Del Rey bags, quit. Media reports suggested that Hill did not agree with the group’s strategy and she is still to be replaced.

“Given all the profit warnings at Mulberry, it was debatable how long the core shareholders would keep faith with the embattled CEO and his strategy,” analyst Nick Bubb said.

Mulberry said chairman Godfrey Davis, 64, would become executive chairman until a successor was found. During his 27 years at the group Davis has been finance chief and CEO.

Shares in the firm, which is 56 percent owned by Singapore billionaires Christina Ong and Ong Beng Seng, rose 1.3 percent to 644.5p at 1028 GMT.

GROWTH STRATEGY

Mulberry is not the only luxury firm to pursue more exclusive aspirations, larger rivals like Kering and LVMH, respective parents to Gucci and Louis Vuitton, have also been surprised by newcomers grabbing customers at the lower end of the market.

The likes of Michael Kors and Tory Burch, whose bags are priced at a fraction of their more illustrious rivals, are proving increasingly popular, especially with emerging market customers - the industry’s main growth engine.

Guillon, who joined Mulberry from Birkin handbag maker Hermes and also worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci, oversaw an early rise in Mulberry’s share price to 2,500 pence, lifting its stock market value to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), before a string of profit warnings dragged that value down to less than 400 million today.

Guillon issued his first major warning in October 2012 when sales of its leather goods and accessories were hit by a slowdown in Asia. Five months later he issued a second warning as fewer tourists hit its home market and 10 months on he warned on profits again.

On the last occasion Guillon, who was paid a total of 807,000 pounds in 2013, told Reuters he’d stick to his strategy. A new collection of bags was unveiled in February in collaboration with British model Cara Delevingne.

Mulberry, which still sells 60 percent of its bags for under 1,000 pounds, has focused on improving product quality and has committed to making half of its handbags in England as it seeks a higher-end position for the brand.

In a statement, Davis said Guillon “has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering” and increased the firm’s international appeal and sales overseas.

“I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved,” Davis said.###679||�ANKARA, Turkey (AP) � Turkey blocked access to Twitter today after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to "rip out the roots" of the social network where links have proliferated to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.

Turkey in the past blocked access to YouTube, but it is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country and was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government's reputation ahead of local elections this month.

Despite the ban, tech-savvy users managed to tweet links to the recordings today. President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan, was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. "I hope this implementation won't last long," he wrote.

Many � although not all � users trying to access the network early today instead saw a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey's lawyers' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey's main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation.

Twitter's @policy account earlier sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or "SMS." It was unclear how those tweets would be viewable.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey � a country that is seeking to join the European Union � as "groundless, pointless, cowardly." Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.

Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications, said his office was obeying court orders. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating "personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives" and said access would be restored when Twitter removes illegal content. "Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet," he said. "We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness."

Links to the leaked recordings have been popping up on Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan's instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 elections.

The original source of the recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news report that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.###680||Empty###681||This Chinese satellite photo shows an object in the southern Indian Ocean that might be debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 that disappeared with 239 people aboard in early March. This satellite photo was obtained by a Chinese Earth-observation satellite on March 18, 2014 and released by the country's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense on March 22.

A Chinese satellite orbiting Earth has captured a new photo of possible debris from the missing Malaysian Airlines jet that disappeared with 239 people aboard earlier this month.

The new Chinese satellite photo was captured by one of China's Earth-observation satellites on Tuesday (March 18) and released today (March 22) by China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND). The image shows a large object in the southern Indian Ocean, according to a translation of the image description.

SASTIND officials said the object is about 72 feet (22 meters) by 43 feet (13 m). It was spotted about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southwest of the location of another possible debris sighting by an Australian satellite earlier this week, they added. [Facts about Malaysia Flight 370]

The new satellite photo is the latest clue in the ongoing search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 jet that disappeared on March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Since the disappearance, the search effort has focused on two vast arcs, one stretching north from Malaysia up toward Kazakhstan in Central Asia, and another stretching south across the Indian Ocean.

After an initial search of the potential debris location from the Australian satellite came up empty, search teams are now studying the Chinese satellite photo lead, according to press reports. Search and recovery ships are headed to the location to search for any debris, Malaysia Ministry of Defense officials said.

The Associated Press reported today that two Chinese military planes arrived in Perth, Australia to join Australian, U.S. and New Zealand aircraft in the search. Search flights on Saturday also yielded no signs of the missing jet, and it is unclear if the search area will be changed in the wake of the new Chinese satellite photo, the AP reported.

You'll get credit for them—good for buying socks, giant liters of soda or cat food—but you won't be getting cash.

3,100 stores across the U.S. will be kicking off the new trade-in program, Walmart announced in a conference call today. Exec Duncan Mac Naughton said that the focus is "is to pay more games and sell them for less." Representatives said that the range of trade-in value changes with game age—just like at Gamestop and other retail outlets— but anticipate that $35 will be most common price point.

In a Q&A session after the announcement, the topic of giving cash back for games came up. Mac Naughton said that "[customers] would get a credit at Walmart which I would argue is just like cash." The program comes on the heels of a smartphone and tablet trade-in program and will be also handled by CExchange, which implements similar programs at Radio Shack.

The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online. Walmart says they want a chunk of the $2 billion pre-owned video game "opportunity" but after-market sales of games is something that tends to rankle the publisher who supply store shelves with new-release titles. When asked in that Q&A session how publishers have reacted to their plans, company reps said "they're excited," followed by a friendly directive for journalists to ask them how the publishers in question felt.

Walmart's a huge retailer with ridiculous reach so—while the EAs and the Microsofts of the world may bristle at the idea of their titles getting resold without getting a cut—it's tough to imagine any kind of real pushback.

It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content."Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimization of citizens," it said.San Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message."Twitter, mwitter!," Erdogan told thousands of supporters at a rally late on Thursday, in a phrase translating roughly as "Twitter, schmitter!""We will wipe out all of these," said Erdogan, who has cast the corruption scandal as part of a smear campaign by his political enemies."The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is," he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.Twitter users in Turkey began reporting widespread outages overnight. Some users trying to open the Twitter.com website were taken to a statement apparently from another regulator (TIB) citing four court orders as the basis for the ban.The corruption investigation became public on December 17 when police detained the sons of three cabinet ministers and businessmen close to Erdogan. The three ministers resigned a week later, while others were removed in a cabinet reshuffle.At an extraordinary session on Wednesday, parliament's speaker blocked opposition pleas to have a prosecutor's report with allegations against the former ministers read out.A document purporting to be that report appeared on Twitter last week. It included alleged transcripts of wiretapped phone conversations, pictures from physical surveillance and pictures of official documents accusing the former ministers and two of their sons of involvement with an Iranian businessman in a bribery and smuggling racket.Reuters has not been able to verify the authenticity of the document.Turkish Internet users were quick to come up with ways to circumvent the block. The hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly moved among the top trending globally.The disruption sparked a virtual uproar, with many comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.There were also calls to take to the street to protest, although some users equally called for calm.Nazli Ilicak, a columnist who used to work for the pro-government Sabah newspaper described the move as "a civil coup" in an interview on broadcaster CNN Turk.The move was only the latest clash between Turkey's ruling party and social media companies including Google, Facebook and Twitter.After a series of popular protests partly fuelled by Twitter last summer, Erdogan slammed the service as "a scourge."Shortly thereafter a government minister asked Twitter to establish an office in Turkey so that it could better communicate requests to take down content or hold the company accountable to Turkish law. Twitter did not respond to the request.Erdogan said two weeks ago that Turkey could also ban Facebook and YouTube, which he says have been abused by his enemies after a stream of audio recordings purportedly revealing corruption in his inner circle emerged online.But a senior official said on Friday there were no immediate plans to do so."The path was taken to block access within the framework of a court decision because of the failure to overcome the problem with the management of Twitter," the official said."At the moment there is no such a decision for Facebook and other social media," he told Reuters.© Thomson Reuters 2014###687||WASHINGTON — All but one of the nation’s 30 largest banks are better able to withstand a severe U.S. recession and global downturn than at any time since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

The only bank to fail the Fed’s annual “stress test” was Zions Bancorp, parent of Vectra Bank Colorado. Vectra Bank is the state’s seventh-largest bank, with deposits of $2.15 billion and an active small-business lender.

Zions, based in Salt Lake City, lacked the minimum level of capital the Fed deemed necessary to withstand a crisis after it booked hefty charges last year related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items. The bank’s director of investor relations was unable to comment before publication.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during a severe recession.

Under the Fed’s stress tests’ “severely adverse” scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment — now at 6.7 percent — would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That’s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year’s tests.

The 30 tested banks included some of Colorado’s largest: Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.

The accolade from US business ethics think-tank the Ethisphere Institute makes Connor is one of only a few Asia based companies to receive the award - and the only sourcing company in the world to be included on the list.

The award recognises organisations that continue to raise the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior, with the evaluation process covering everything from codes of ethics, litigation and business practices to the firm's impact on local communities, along with feedback from customers and employees.

Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance programme (25%), reputation, leadership and innovation (20%), governance (10%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (25%) and culture of ethics (20%).

"We have certainly been experiencing increased interest from clients based on their desire to be ethically compliant, which makes me very proud of what we have achieved as a business," explains Connor's chairman and CEO, William E (Chip) Connor.

Connor's success is based on a business model that enables brands, retailers and importers to source apparel and homewares from a global supply base of over 6,000 audited factories.

However, the company does not hold an equity interest in any factory, nor receive any financial benefit from factories. Instead, Connor puts together a portfolio of options providing details of different factories, prices, technical evaluations, spec packs, quality assurance and a vendor scorecard so that customers can make their own decisions. The sourcing firm's earnings are generated only from client commissions, based on the value of products delivered.

Connor also prides itself on high volume, long-term relationships with customers such as US retailer Dillards, with which it has been working for 42 years, and UK retailer Marks & Spencer (also recognised by Ethisphere), which has been a client for 17 years.

Other apparel firms included on the 2014 list of the world's most ethical companies are Gap Inc, Levi Strauss & Co and Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M).###690||19 March 2014 By Mof Gimmers

As you may have heard, we'll be getting a new £1 coin which looks like an old threepenny bit, thereby ensuring future observational comedians the opportunity to coo "remember when quid coins were circular eh? What's that all about?"

Why are we getting a new pound? Well, apparently, it'll be the coin that is the hardest in the world to make a forgery of and has been described as a "giant leap into the future". As there are 43 million fake quid coins in circulation, you can understand why the Royal Mint might want to do something about it.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years’ loyal service the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency."

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

The new coin will be 'bimetallic' like the £2 coin and will have new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint HQ.

The Royal Mint chief executive, Adam Lawrence, thinks this is an "exciting project" and added: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time. It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK’s currency in the process."

Meanwhile, news is breaking this morning on several stocks that could see heavy trading in today's session, including GameStop (NYSE:GME), Hertz (NYSE:HTZ), and DSW (NYSE:DSW).

GameStop has a brand new threat on its hands. The video game retailer's stock was down 4.4% in pre-market trading after The Wall Street Journal reported that Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is jumping into the used video game business. Wal-Mart will soon begin paying customers for pre-owned games and allowing them to apply that cash toward new game purchases, or for any other items within its stores. Despite a successful push into other business categories over the last few years, used game profits remain key to GameStop's bottom line, accounting for almost 25% of earnings. Still, the company has fended off many other challenges to that lucrative business.

Hertz shares are up 0.6% in pre-market trading after the car rental company reported fourth-quarter earnings results and announced plans to break its equipment rental business off into a separate company. Hertz plans to perform the split as a tax free spinoff to shareholders, with much of the $2.5 billion in proceeds set to fund a huge stock buyback of up to 20% of the company's outstanding shares. Separately, Hertz booked a slightly disappointing 10% increase in fourth-quarter sales to $2.6 billion, which resulted in a 20% dip in profit to $0.26 a share.

Finally, DSW said this morning that revenue improved by a slim 3.8% in its fiscal fourth quarter as comparable-store sales growth was flat. The shoe retailer's adjusted profit also fell to $0.31 a share from last year's $0.35 a share. Still, DSW management seems confident in the company's future: The company hiked its dividend by 50% and boosted its outlook for store potential to 525 locations, about 30% greater than its current store footprint. DSW's stock is unchanged in pre-market trading.###693||Empty###694||The euro declined against the US dollar on trading Tuesday, after building permits in the US rose more-than-expected in February, backing the case for further stimulus cuts before the Federal Reserve starts a two-day meeting later today.

EUR/USD touched a session low at 1.3890 at 10:00 GMT, after which the pair trimmed some losses to trade at 1.3902 at 14:08 GMT, losing 0.14% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 17th low, 1.3880, while resistance was to be encountered at March 17th high, 1.3948.

Building permits for future projects rose 7.7% to a 1.018 million annualized pace last month, the most since October, data by the US Department of Commerce showed today. The number of permits filed for future projects in January was upward revised to a 0.945 million pace from a 0.937 million reported earlier. Analysts had expected a smaller gain to a 0.960 million pace in February. The increase reflected a surge in applications for apartment-building construction. However, one-family building permits declined for a third consecutive month, reaching the weakest level in a year.

At the same time, housing starts declined at a 0.2% annualized rate to 0.907 million last month, after a revised up 0.909 million pace in the previous month. Analysts had predicted an increase to 0.910 million housing starts in February.

A separate report revealed that consumer prices in the US rose 0.1% in February, in line with analysts’ projections and matching January’s advance. Data also showed that more than 50% of the increase was due to higher food costs.

The Federal Reserve, which reduced monthly bond buying by $10 billion at the prior two meetings, will cut purchases by another $10 billion to $55 billion, and continue reductions at the same pace at every meeting before exiting the program at its Oct. 28-29 gathering, according to a Bloomberg survey.

Meanwhile, the 18-nation common currency was pressured after economic sentiment data for Germany and for the euro zone as a whole came in well-below expectations.

Economic sentiment in the largest euro area economy, Germany, deteriorated sharply, reaching a 7-month low in March, data by the ZEW Centre for Economic Research showed today.

The ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung), reported that its index of German economic sentiment slid by 9.1 basis points to reach 46.4 this month, the weakest level since August, from a reading of 55.7 in February. At the same time, analysts had expected a smaller drop by 2.7 basis points to 53.0 this month.

In addition, the euro area economic sentiment also registered a decline, coming in at 61.5 in March, down from 68.5 in the previous month and as analysts projected the index will decline to 67.3 this month.

Elsewhere, EUR/CAD touched a session low at 1.5332 at 12:51 GMT, after which consolidation followed at 1.5341, losing 0.3% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 13th low, 1.5310, while resistance was to be met at March 17th high, 1.5448.###695||Empty###696||Walmart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors.

The move by Walmart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise.



Other retailers including Target and Best Buy offer to match the lower prices of rivals - but only if shoppers do the research on their own.

AlertMe###697||MUNICH (Reuters) - German luxury carmaker BMW <BMWG.DE> is looking at raising production capacity at its plant in the United States and releasing 12 new models as it chases record car sales and a rise in pretax profit in 2014, it said on Wednesday.

BMW's plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina currently has an annual production capacity of around 350,000 and makes sport utility vehicles, including the X3, X4, X5 and X6 models.

"The U.S. will stay a market with great potential for us. This is why we are evaluating the possibility of increasing capacity in the U.S.", Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said at the company's annual results press conference.

Investments made at plants in China will allow BMW to raise production capacity there to 400,000 cars, from 300,000 in 2013.

The Munich-based owner of the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW brands reiterated it aims to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, after it delivered a record 1.96 million cars in 2013.

"We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year, despite ongoing volatile business conditions," Reithofer said.

Last week, BMW reported its automotive division's fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped 14 percent to 1.77 billion euros ($2.46 billion), beating analyst expectations of 1.68 billion euros.

The forecasts are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014, and on a steady recovery in European markets, BMW said.

BMW expects significant growth in markets outside of Europe including high single-digit growth in North America and low double-digit growth in China.

Analysts welcomed the positive outlook.

"We see BMW's confidence as a major positive trigger for the stock," analysts at ISI Global said in a note on Wednesday.

At 0950 GMT, BMW shares were up 5.1 percent at 84.88 euros.

BMW said it expected sales in the second half of 2014 to be higher than in the first six months as a result of a large number of model launches, including of the compact 2-series coupe and the 2-series Active Tourer.

Regulators are reviewing the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger to see if it complies with antitrust laws. The number of states that have joined in the federal review isn’t know, but Indiana is reportedly conducting its own evaluation of the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger’s impact.

Comcast has said it will shed 3 million cable TV subscribers to keep its share of the pay TV market under 30% in a bid to appease regulators. The Comcast-Time Warner cable merger must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission before it can go forward.

CMCSA stock fell almost 1% in Wednesday morning trading, while TWC stock slipped slightly.

More Merger News:###704||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- After less than two years at Symantec's (SYMC) helm, the software maker terminated CEO Steve Bennett on Thursday, a shock move that has sent its shares spiraling.

Analysts were surprised by the decision, warning it bodes badly for Symantec's turnaround effort. Shares of the security and storage specialist were off 10.07% at $18.80 in pre-market trading. Symantec's stock is down 14.81% over the last 12 months.



WATCH: Symantec Shares Suffer After Third CEO Shakeup in Five Years

FBR Capital Markets Analyst Daniel Ives described Bennett's termination as "jaw dropping" in a note released on Friday. "Despite a few speed bumps fundamentally over the past few quarters, and March guidance below expectations, we believe Mr. Bennett was viewed as key to the turnaround story at Symantec, and we think this abrupt changing of the guard could potentially lead some investors to throw in the "white towel" as it represents a big step backward in the company's recovery process," he wrote.

Bennett's termination marks the company's third CEO change in just over five years. Former Intuit (INTU) CEO Bennett took the company's reins from Enrique Salem in July 2012, vowing to revitalize the company, which has long been criticized for poor execution. In January 2013 he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

"While Mr. Bennett had only unveiled his new strategic direction for Symantec in January 2013, it appears the board was expecting a faster transition toward improved market positioning and growth, an Everest-like challenge, in our view, after years of missteps (e.g., acquisitions, execution issues)," wrote FBR Capital Markets' Ives.

During an interview in November, Bennett told TheStreet that he had underestimated the impact of the company's massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his Symantec turnaround plan.

Bennett's termination prompted Jefferies to downgrade Symantec to 'hold' on Friday. "Following the abrupt CEO change, uncertainty around the direction and timeline for the next phase of the strategy will grow," wrote Jefferies analyst Aaron Schwartz, in a note. "The CEO change comes at a time when the implementation of the new strategic direction is still fairly early and follows several other senior management departures."

Schwartz added that deterioration in Symantec's morale and execution is a risk, citing the company's "uncertain" strategic and operational direction.

Michael Brown has been appointed as Symantec's interim president and CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement for Bennett. Brown, the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, joined Symantec following its merger with Veritas in 2005.

Bennett was the architect of Symantec's so-called "5/30 plan" - a roadmap to achieve 5% revenue growth and a 30% margins target by fiscal year 2017 that forms the cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.

Symantec reiterated its commitment to the 5/30 plan in the statement announcing Bennett's departure, and also reconfirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, however, has warned that the CEO's termination further jeopardizes the 5/30 plan, and lowered its Symantec price target to $17 from $18 on Friday. "Our new $17 PO is based on a 15% probability the 5/30 plan will go as planned (vs 25% previously), given our lower level of confidence following the termination of the CEO," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan.

"We will wipe out Twitter. I don't care what the international community says," he told followers at a rally in the run-up to March 30 local elections. Everyone could expect to see Turkey's strength, he added while drumming up support in the northwestern city of Bursa on Thursday (20.03.2014).

According to Turkish newspaper "Hürriyet," Erdogan's press department issued a statement shortly afterward to explain the prime minster's decree. Twitter had "ignored" Turkish court orders to remove certain links after Turkish citizens had filed complaints. On Friday (21.03.2014), Turkish newspaper "Radikal" published a statement by the public prosecutor's office which said that there was no court order to block Twitter.

Shortly after the ban was imposed, Turkish President Abdullah Gul made headlines by strongly criticizing the decision to block the platform. "One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms," Gul tweeted, clearly circumventing the ban. "I hope this implementation won't last long."

Gul, a frequent user of social media, has been critical of Erdogan's censorship moves long before - he chafed at the beginning of March when Erdogan demanded YouTube and Facebook be blocked. "YouTube and Facebook are recognized platforms all over the world. A ban is out of the question," Gul said at the time.

Criticism continues online, despite the ban

According to market researchers GlobalWebIndex, around 40 percent of Turkish Internet users are registered on Twitter. After the ban was imposed, shortly after midnight, people turned to other social media platforms such as Facebook to vent about the Erdogan administration.

Turkey's president has criticized Erdogan's move and says Twitter should not be blocked

"It's such a shame to have Erdogan as prime minister. I fear he is going to shut down the entire country," a Facebook user wrote. "My beloved democratic country! After the elections you are going to block Facebook as well. These messages are the last bits of our freedom," another posted. People also drew comparisons to other countries where Twitter is blocked. "What countries are blocking Twitter? Yes indeed, Turkey is now on the same level as China," a Facebook user wrote.

Shortly after the ban was imposed, people began sharing tips via cell phone apps and videos on how to circumvent the ban by changing one's DNS settings to allow access to Twitter. "It took me two minutes to change the DNS settings; I can now use Twitter again," a Facebook user wrote. This trick was picked up by millions of other Twitter users. Just a few hours after Twitter was blocked, hashtags like #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #TurkeyBlockedTwitter were top of the global hashtag ranks.

Despite the ban, members of the Turkish government have continued to tweet as well - like Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc who announced that Erdogan's Justice and Development Party's (AKP) election campaign would be in the province of Manisa on Friday. "Arinc uses Twitter for his daily election campaign? Now I'm confused. Why then block the site at all?" a user complained.

Social media pressures Erdogan

Erdogan's fight against Twitter started last year when protests in Istanbul's Gezi Park were in full swing. He publicly called the platform a "menace," stressing again and again that Twitter was distributing lies. In the past year, Twitter has been used as the main means of communication for millions of demonstrators in Turkey. Mass protests were widely organized via the service.

People in Turkey have to resort to tricks to be able to access Twitter

But Erdogan and his government have increasingly come under pressure - more so after a corruption scandal involving the Erdogan administration was unveiled in mid-December. Since then, alleged telephone conversations between Erdogan and his son Bilal were leaked and published on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. In these conversations, Erdogan reportedly told his son to hide huge sums of money. It's still unclear to this date who is responsible for publishing these recordings. Erdogan has accused a parallel state led by US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, a former political ally of Erdogan.

Media expert Asli Tunc of Istanbul's Bilgi University told DW that shutting down Twitter doesn't make sense. "It's very hard to fight such technology. There will be software and programs that help people circumvent the ban," she said. The Turkish government blocked YouTube a couple of years ago, but even back then there had been many possibilities to circumvent the ban.

Amnesty International has also strongly criticized the ban and called on the Turkish government to immediately reinstate access to Twitter. "The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on Internet freedom and freedom of expression," Amnesty International said in a statement.###707||Retail Week is the most trusted source of business intelligence for the retail industry.

###708||NEW YORK � Wal-Mart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Wal-Mart stores for store credit but not cash. The credit can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Wal-Mart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

''Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,'' said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Wal-Mart executives said CE Exchange, the company that Wal-Mart works with on its trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy offer used video trade in programs, but the Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which has the largest and most well-established video game trade-in program.

Wal-Mart made a point of saying that credit offered for video games can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

GameStop shares fell $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $37.89 in morning trading. The stock had been down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.

But one analyst said the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. Other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with ''modest'' success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian. In contrast, GameStop has consolidated its market share of video game retail sales and has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

''History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,'' he wrote in a client note.

Wal-Mart shares rose 23 cents to $74.92 in morning trading.###709||Empty###710||Empty###711||Empty###712||Empty###713||Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) today made available the results of the company's 2014 Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test on the Bank of America Investor Relations website at http://investor.bankofamerica.com under Events and Presentations.

Turkey's courts blocked access to Twitter following Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's vow, on the campaign trail ahead of March 30 local elections, to "wipe out" the service. He says he does not care what the international community says about it, though President Abdullah Gul has objected to his actions.###715||Empty###716||CLOSE Sally Beauty is the latest retailer to fall victim to hackers.

Yet another retailer is fessing-up with some details of a data snafu.

Sally Beauty, one of the world's largest retailers of professional beauty products, is reporting that a security breach discovered on March 5, affected fewer than 25,000 a credit and debit card accounts.

The Denton, Texas-based seller of beauty supplies says it is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm and says that it's working with the U.S. Secret Service.

"We take this criminal activity very seriously," the company said in a statement. "We continue to work diligently with Verizon on this investigation and are taking necessary actions and precautions to mitigate and remediate the issues caused by this security incident. In addition, we are working with the United States Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter."

WHAT TO DO: Protecting yourself from identity theft

For the nation's retailers, data breaches have become an explosive issue -- and a driver of serious consumer angst -- since Target reported a massive security breach shortly before Christmas. Other major retailers, including Neiman Marcus, have reported data breaches since the holiday season.

It's become a key concern for consumers, and some recent reports even show the data snafu may be cutting into customer traffic at Target stores as some concerned customers shop elsewhere.

Sally Beauty currently owns and operates more than 2,800 Sally Beauty Supply stores worldwide, including stores in every state in the United States; Puerto Rico and Canada. Sally Beauty Supply offers over 6,000 professional quality products for hair, skin and nails to retail customers and salon professionals.

The company has loyalty discount programs, such as the Beauty Club Card, for non-professional customers and the Sally ProCard for professional customers.

Kerry Koonce crunches the numbers for Iowa Workforce Development. “Our rate was at 4.3-percent — it’s a tenth of a percent up from 4.2 in December. Part of that is due to benchmarking as the numbers change a little bit. But, compared to January 2013 — we were at five percent — so we are significantly below where we were a year ago,” Koonce says.

The benchmarking Koonce mentioned is the annual process where they bring all of last year’s monthly numbers up to date before figuring the new year numbers. Koonce says the numbers released each month sometimes don’t include all the information available. “Sometimes it’s a quarter later when all of the data comes in, January’s data, it can be April before we see everything. So we go back and true up those numbers to what the real information is from what employers report on their quarterly information and those kinds of things,” Koonce says. “And so you will see some changes in each month’s numbers of the previous year which overall can have an impact on what the annual rate is and those kinds of things.”

The numbers show the state lost 7,300 jobs from December to January. “The majority of that came in the trade, transportation and utilities area…most of it in retail trade. And what it looks like is the seasonable adjustment numbers maybe didn’t capture everything. So, we are expecting that maybe next month that’s going to kind of even back out,” according to Koonce.

Fifty-six-hundred of the lost jobs were in that trade, transportation and utilities sector. “We think that when the February numbers come out — and those will come out later this month — we will see where we are normally at this time of year,” Koonce says.

Regardless of how the numbers are adjusted, she says the overall picture is improving. “We’re almost a full percentage point below where we were this time last year. So that’s a significant improvement for our economy as we continue move forward,” Koonce says. “Plus, our unemployment claims continue to decrease, new claims continue to go down.” The January 2013 unemployment rate for the state was five percent.

The U.S. unemployment rate for January inched down to 6.6-percent from 6.7-percent in December. This was the lowest national rate since October 2008.###718||Empty###719||Empty###720||Earl Stewart, owner of Earl Stewart Toyota, shows the faulty accelerator pedal on a recalled vehicle in North Palm Beach, Fla. in this 2010 photo (Photo: Alan Diaz AP)

If General Motors needs any more indication of how its own safety issues could play out, it need look no farther than Toyota.

The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Toyota will pay $1.2 billion to end a criminal probe into its handling of reports of unintended acceleration.

That's on top of millions of dollars in fines to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and class-action settlements.

General Motors is now under fire for deadly ignition switches in 1.6 million vehicles built in the middle of the last decade that are part of the worldwide recall announced last month. It's just starting the process.

Just as the Justice Department closes its criminal investigation of Toyota, it was disclosed last week that a new one is believed to be underway involving GM.

"The timing of this (Toyota) settlement is interesting because it means the government will finalizing the last major automotive recall, Toyota's unintended acceleration, just as it gears up for the next big recall related to GM's ignition switch," says Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, in a statement. "The cases are similar because they both involve a long, established history of vehicle incidents that took years to identify and address."

Just as Toyota's CEO was brought from Japan to testify to congressial committees, GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday that it's "likely" she will be called to testify to congressional panels as well over the switch issue.

She says GM took too long to acknowledge a problem. She named a safety czar, just as Toyota did when it was under fire.

It's yet to be seen how the ignition switch issue will play out for GM. But its executives have to be paying close attention to Toyota's travails -- and be worried.

Turkey in the past blocked access to YouTube, but it is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country and was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government’s reputation ahead of local elections this month.

Despite the ban, tech-savvy users managed to tweet links to the recordings on Friday. President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan’s, was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets.

“I hope this implementation won’t last long,” he wrote.

Many — although not all — users trying to access the network early on Friday instead saw a notice from Turkey’s telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey’s lawyers’ association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey’s main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation.

Twitter’s @policy account earlier sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or “SMS.” It was unclear how those tweets would be viewable.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey — a country that is seeking to join the European Union — as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.” Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.

Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications, said his office was merely obeying court orders. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating “personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives” and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.

“Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet,” he said. “We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness.”

Links to the leaked recordings have been popping up on Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan’s instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 elections.

The original source of the recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news report that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.

The new coin - modelled on the old threepenny bit, which went out of circulation with the advent on decimalisation in 1971 - replaces the current offering, which has been around for 30 years.The Royal Mint estimates that three per cent of all £1 coins are now forgeries. Over the past few years, around two million fakes have been removed from circulation every 12 months, at considerable cost to banks and the general economy.Plans for the coin were unveiled as Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne prepares to deliver his Budget today. This morning Osborne tweeted a picture of the coin against his famous red box:In addition to having 12 sides, the proposed replacement will have a bi-metallic construction of two colours and include the Mint's new Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology.The Mint has spent around £2 million on iSIS and claims that it enables not just coins, but the whole cash cycle to be more secure, protecting the public, vending machine operators, retailers, and the wider banking system.The coin will have the Queen's effigy on the 'heads' side, but there will be a public competition to decide the design for the reverse, or 'tails' side.Says Osborne: "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency."I am particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying tribute to the past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."It's not just Britain's coins which are getting a makeover.

Passenger car sales in Europe increased for the sixth successive month in February, data published by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) revealed Tuesday.

Registrations of new passenger vehicles advanced 8 percent on an annual basis in February to 861,058 units, which the ACEA said was the second lowest unit figure to date for a month of February since it began the series in 2003 with the enlarged EU. In January, sales grew 5.5 percent.

Among the major member countries, sales grew 4.3 percent annually in Germany, and by 8.6 percent in Italy. Spain recorded a 17.8 percent rise in sales, and U.K. posted a 3 percent gain.

Meanwhile, new car registrations in France decreased by 1.4 percent compared to February 2013, the agency said.

During the two months ended February, demand for new passenger cars advanced 6.6 percent annually to around 1.79 million units.

March 20 (Reuters) - Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said Thursday.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. (r.reuters.com/fup77v)

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley’s most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney’s office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $10 billion would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $9.39 billion. (Reporting by Gerry Shih in San Francisco and Sweta Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Leslie Adler)###729||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- GameStop (GME) was falling 4.8% to $37.84 at 9:53 a.m. on Tuesday amid reports that Wal-Mart (WMT) would restart its video game trade-in business.

Wal-Mart announced Tuesday that the program would begin on Wednesday, March 26. The retail giant said customers can trade in old video games in exchange for gift cards applicable towards any Walmart or Sam's Club purchase, both in stores or online. The program will be available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores in the U.S. and will accept games from the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft (MSFT) XBox 360.

The move could prove extremely problematic for GameStop, which uses a trade-in program as a key part of its business strategy in its nearly 6,500 stores. The company reported in its third-quarter results in January that pre-owned sales increased 7% to $567 million during the 2013 holiday season, which accounted for 18% of all holiday sales. GameStop also expects gross margins for the pre-owned category in the range of 46% to 49% for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year.

STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.

TheStreet Ratings team rates GAMESTOP CORP as a "buy" with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate GAMESTOP CORP (GME) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, solid stock price performance, reasonable valuation levels, good cash flow from operations and compelling growth in net income. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 7.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 18.8%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.

Powered by its strong earnings growth of 111.41% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 44.71% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, GME should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Specialty Retail industry. The net income increased by 111.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from -$624.30 million to $68.60 million.

Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 80.29% to $680.60 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, GAMESTOP CORP has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -19.02%.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s namesake U.S. unit, seeking to combat slowing store traffic and reverse its fourth straight quarterly same-store sales decline, announced that will begin offering store credit for used videogames at its physical stores.

Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed /quotes/nls/wmt WMT , which started testing its plan to accept used games online last year, said it wants a share of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S., currently dominated by No. 1 videogame retailer GameStop Corp. /quotes/zigman/389699/delayed /quotes/nls/gme GME Other retailers, including Best Buy /quotes/zigman/219712/delayed /quotes/nls/bby BBY , also buy used videogames.

Its competitive advantage, Wal-Mart said, is that shoppers can use store credit from trade-ins to buy its wide variety of goods at both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

“We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton told reporters on a call, adding the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an “inflection point” following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year. “There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment.”

The company, which already accepts trade-ins of pre-owned tablets and smartphones, said it will refurbish the pre-owned games for resale. The trade-in program doesn’t include hardware consoles.

Wal-Mart, citing research firm NPD Group, said it’s already the No. 2 U.S. seller of new physical videogame software and hardware. It said there are almost 1 billion units of used videogames that are sitting around in customers’ homes.

While getting more of the 110 million gamers into its stores looks like a safe bet at a time when the company is seeking to increase traffic, it remains to be seen how big of an impact its entry may be. The videogame industry, faced with competition from digital games played on mobile phones and the Internet, has been in decline. According to NPD Group, total physical sales of videogame software in February saw an 11% drop.

However, the used-game business tends to be more profitable. GameStop has said it’s the largest retailer of pre-owned videogames in the world, and that its used game business — with an average price of $19 — generates higher gross margins than do new game sales, with an average price of $41.

With Wal-Mart’s entry, GameStop shares fell 5% on Tuesday in their biggest percentage decline since January. GameStop said in its most recent annual filing that its trade-in program, with about 3,100 game titles, gives it a “unique value proposition” because such purchases are generally unavailable at mass merchants, toy stores and consumer-electronics retailers.

“We see this announcement as a profitability concern more than a market share concern” for GameStop, said Stifel analyst David Schick, adding pre-owned business represented 26% of GameStop’s sales and 42% of its gross profit the last 12 months.

New Jersey's unemployment rate fell to 7.1 percent in January, according to preliminary data the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released this morning. But the state lost an estimated 3,900 jobs in the process.

The unemployment rate is nearly two points lower than a year ago, the data show. In January 2014, the jobless rate stood at 8.9 percent.

The January rate also is a notch below the revised 7.2 percent rate that New Jersey tallied in December.

But the preliminary data show that the state had 3.9249 million jobs in January. That's just 5,600 more jobs than January of 2013, when the state reported 3.9193 million jobs.

A report from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development out this morning with "benchmarked" revisions to the 2013 data shows that the state gained 18,800 jobs last year, all within the private sector. The public sector shrank by 1,000 jobs last year, the data also show.

That's stronger than earlier estimates. A preliminary report released in January showed New Jersey may have only gained 10,100 jobs last year.

Walmart said that it was launching a video game trade-in program, in which the big box retailer will go after the $2 billion used video game market.

Starting March 26, approximately 3,100 U.S. Walmart stores will begin accepting video game trade-ins. The traded-in games will be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition both online and in stores. The video games will be labeled "Certified Pre-Owned," which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition, Walmart says.

"We're going to shake up the market place," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., in a conference call with reporters. "We're not participating in the $2 billion used gaming industry at all."

The move will place pressure on Best Buy (BBY)and Amazon (AMZN), but it will especially hit GameStop as the Grapevine, Texas-based company formed a niche selling video games and gaming hardware.

"This WMT news will very likely represent the latest worry for GME investors and make for another weight upon shares at least near term. WMT is retailing's '800 lb. gorilla,' and we cannot discount any of its moves," Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel wrote in a note to clients.

That said, any "buy-sell-trade" model is "notoriously difficult for even seasoned retail chains to execute," Nagel said. "GME has been successful in the business for a long time. We are very hesitant to discount meaningfully the dominance of GME in the category, even against WMT. The market has worried that used video games might become the next 'dinosaur' in consumer products. We view WMT's move into the category as a validation of the category's longevity." Oppenheimer's Nagel rates GameStop at a "outperform."###737||



Three top Democrats in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives yesterday requested Gilead Sciences CEO John C. Martin Ph.D. give them “a briefing” on the pricing of the company’s new chronic Hepatitis C virus treatment Sovaldi™ (sofosbuvir) 400 mg tablets, complaining about “the extraordinary high cost of your drug.”

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the three Democrats said in a letter to Dr. Martin. The three are Henry A. Waxman (D-CA), ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce; Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), ranking member of the panel’s Subcommittee on Health; and Diana DeGette (D-CO), ranking member of the committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

They cited news reports that Gilead plans to charge $84,000 per 12-week treatment for Sovaldi, which won FDA approval in December after six months. That cost could nearly double when Sovaldi is combined with other drugs, the House Democrats said.

“These costs are likely to be too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and those with private insurance,” Reps. Waxman, Pallone and DeGette wrote.

Gilead has noted that the cost of the drug is lower than the cost of complications associated with hepatitis C treatment, such as liver damage or liver failure: “In our conversations with payers, pricing is a consideration, but efficacy, safety and treatment guidelines are equally important,” Gilead COO John Milligan told Bloomberg in January.

Sovaldi is a once-daily oral nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor designed to block a specific protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate. Sovaldi is the first drug that has shown the safety and efficacy to treat certain types of HCV infection without the need for injection of interferon at the same time.

Sovaldi won FDA’s priority review and breakthrough therapy designations, granted to investigational medicines deemed to offer major advances in treatment over existing options.

“It is our hope that Sovaldi will mark the beginning of a new era in hepatitis C treatment,” Dr. Martin declared at the time in a statement.



























###738||Walmart will soon begin offering a video game trade-in program to collect used games and resell them in stores and online.

Starting on March 26, gamers can bring their used video games into some 3,100 Walmart stores and receive a credit to spend on anything they want at Walmart and Sam’s Club stores or on the retailer’s website. The video games must be in working condition and in the original packaging, and must be brought to the electronics department where employees will evaluate them and determine a trade-in price. Customers cannot receive cash back for video games.

Walmart executives said they will accept thousands of popular video games for Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox and Nintento Wii, and will refurbish them and resell them in stores and online later this year. There more than 880 million video games being played in homes across the country.

Walmart tested a video game trade-in program in 2009 that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud. On a call with media on Monday, executives said that program was shut down and the retailer has since been working to create a simpler and fairer video buy-back system. Last fall, the Arkansas-based retailer also rolled out a trade-in program for smartphones and tablets. Walmart’s partners with CExchange, which refurbishes, recycles and assesses the value of used tech gadgets.

France issued new satellite images on Sunday which show possible debris from the missing Boeing 777, Malaysian officials said, as searchers are presently combing a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean, trying to locate the debris.

The images given to searchers in Australia “show potential objects” in the same part of the ocean where previous satellite images released by Australia and China showed objects that could be debris from the plane, Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport said in a statement.

Malaysia Airlines MH370 search: French satellite images provide more hope http://t.co/oIUAU5Baqe pic.twitter.com/XLOyGca0GD — CBC News (@CBCNews) March 23, 2014

The latest image seems to be another possible clue in the mysterious and futile search for the aircraft that went missing March 8, less than an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.

In response to the newly released images from France, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said, “any satellite images or other new information that comes to AMSA is being considered in developing the search plans.”

One of the objects in the French images was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite. But officials said the French satellite image was unclear and fuzzy, making it difficult to determine precise dimensions.

Ships have been sent in to try to locate a wooden pallet that appeared to be surrounded by straps of varying lengths and colors. It was spotted Saturday by spotters in a search plane, but no images were captured of it and a military PC Orion military plane dispatched to locate the pallet could not find it.

“So, we’ve gone back to that area again today to try and re-find it,” said Mike Barton, chief of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s rescue coordination center. An Australian navy ship was also involved in the search.

“The use of wooden pallets is quite common in the aircraft industry. They are usually packed into another container which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft but within that container it is quite common to have items on pallets.” Barton said.

“It’s a possible lead but we will need to be very certain that this is a pallet because pallets are used in the shipping industry as well,” Barton said.

The images are reinforcing proof for the massive hunt for these objects, which has been underway since Friday. However, authorities are finding the remoteness of the search area, as well as weather, one of the biggest challenges.

“At 2500 kilometres (1,500 miles) away, they are operating at the limits of their endurance and only having a short period of one to two hours in the search area and back again so that’s only allowing us to get in a [single] search a day, which is again spreading the search over several days,” Barton said.

Application may not work as expected.###753||WASHINGTON -- The United States has slapped fresh sanctions on individuals close to President Vladimir Putin over Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, penalties that officials and legal experts say could severely restrict the targeted Russians' ability to do business throughout the world.U.S. President Barack Obama announced the measures, aimed at senior Russian officials, wealthy businessmen in Putin's "inner circle," and Bank Rossiya, which has close ties to Russia's leadership."Based on the executive order that I signed in response to Russia's initial intervention in Ukraine, we are imposing sanctions on more senior officials of the Russian government," Obama said. "In addition, we are today sanctioning a number of other individuals with substantial resources and influence who provide material support to the Russian leadership, as well as a bank that provides material support to these individuals."The administration also vowed that further punitive steps are on the way.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned that "the question at this point is not if we will do more sanctions, it’s when."Those hit with sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the influential head of Russian Railways, oil trader Gennady Timchenko, and Putin’s chief of staff and close associate, Sergei Ivanov, as well as a handful of others.The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned Bank Rossiya -- among the country's 20 largest banks -- which it called “the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”Its chairman, Yury Kovalchuk, was also placed on the sanctions list.A senior U.S. administration official told reporters in a call that the named individuals “will be unable to access any U.S. financial services, will find it difficult to transact in the dollar, and I suspect will find it very difficult to transact in Europe and elsewhere, as our partners around the world have demonstrated over time a willingness to also adhere to the sanctions that we are imposing."Russian officials included in an initial round of U.S. sanctions on March 17 scoffed at that move, saying they had neither any assets in the United States nor any desire to visit the country.But another senior U.S. official who spoke to journalists by phone after this latest round insisted that the sanctions have teeth.“People may think that they are a mere wrist slap. I can assure them that they are not,” the official said.Legal experts said the fresh sanctions could create havoc for the designated individuals as they try to conduct business, particularly when trying to move money around the world.Douglas McNabb, a Washington-based lawyer specializing in financial sanctions and extradition law, said that "even some banks that don’t have corresponding relations with the U.S. still won’t have anything to do with individuals who have been designated.”One of the targeted individuals, Timchenko, is a Soviet-born Finnish citizen who until this week was a co-owner of the oil-trading company Gunvor, which has a head office in Geneva and a registered office in Cyprus.Gunvor issuedsoon after the announcement saying that in anticipation of "potential economic sanctions," Timchenko on March 19 sold all of his shares in the company to his partner, Swedish businessman Torbjorn Törnqvist.Last year, Reuters reported that Timchenko had hired Washington lobbyists in a bid to secure funding backed by the U.S. government for a luxury aircraft business.Though quickly denied by officials at Gunvor, theon Thursday asserted that "Putin has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor funds."Meanwhile, Bank Rossiya, with about $10 billion in assets, will be effectively shut out of U.S. dollar activities worldwide and have its correspondent relationships with banks across the globe placed under threat, according to Steve Ganis, an expert on financial sanctions with the Boston law firm Mintz Levin.Obama also announced an executive order signed that enables the U.S. government to introduce sanctions on entire sectors of the Russian economy. A senior administration official said that could include the energy, engineering, financial services, or metals and mining sectors.“Once those sectors are designated...we will then be able to impose sanctions on specific entities within those sectors,” the official said. “This is a flexible tool that we can use in response to further provocations” -- the official said, citing potential Russian incursions into other areas of Ukraine.Boston lawyer Ganis said that sanctions on the Russian energy sector could be “quite disruptive” to Russian energy companies but that such sanctions could also affect global markets and create problems for European countries dependent on Russian energy.A U.S. administration official said Washington is "working actively to prepare additional sanctions under these authorities using their creative breadth to design sanctions that will hurt the entities with...the smallest possible impact on us and our allies."Obama’s is traveling next week to Europe, where he said he will discuss the Ukrainian situation with the United States' Group of Seven (G7) partners.###754||Empty###755||Following President Obama’s order on Thursday of sanctions against two dozen Russian citizens, credit card issuers Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and MasterCard Inc. (NYSE: MA) have stopped providing services to two Russian Banks. One bank, Bank Rossiya, was on the Treasury Department’s sanction list, while the other bank, SMP, was added.

SMP is owned by billionaire brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who are reported to be childhood chums of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Bank Rossiya is the country’s 15th largest bank, with $12 billion in assets, and is described by U.S. officials as the personal bank for senior Russian Federation officials. SMP, with assets of around $5 billion, is among Russia’s 40 largest banks.

The actions taken by Visa and MasterCard prevent bank customers from using their cards but do not prevent those customers from accessing their cash directly at the banks. SMP’s owners have objected to the card companies’ actions, according to Reuters:

Due to the fact that the sanctions were imposed on shareholders and not on the bank, we consider the moves by the payment systems unlawful and we are confident that we can resolve the encountered difficulties in the near future.

SMP also said it has no assets in the United States.

Fitch Ratings and S&P have both warned that Russia’s credit rating may be downgraded to reflect the potential impact on the country’s economy of the sanctions. Lower sovereign debt ratings mean that the Russian government would likely be forced to pay higher interest on its borrowing.

Russia’s MICEX index fell 2.1% Friday and is down more than 10% in the month of March.###756||Empty###757||French satellites have spotted "potential objects" in the southern Indian Ocean, where a search is going on for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, the Malaysian government announced.

"This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities," Malaysia's transport ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

"Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre."

The source said the French image was captured Friday and was about 930-km north from where the Chinese and Australian objects were seen.

The official, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said one of the objects was estimated to be about the same size as an object captured Tuesday by the Chinese satellite that appeared to be 22 meters by 13 meters.

The latest information was announced as planes and a ship scrambled to find a pallet and other debris in a remote patch of the Indian Ocean to determine whether the objects were from the jet that went missing for more than two weeks now.

Earlier on Sunday as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said there are credible leads in the case.

"Yesterday, one of our civilian search aircraft got visuals on a number of objects in a fairly small area in the overall Australian search zone," Abbott said.

The pallet was spotted by a search plane on Saturday, but has not been closely examined. Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be used on planes.

It is the latest in a series of clues experts and searchers are trying to run down to solve the mystery of what happened to Flight 370 when it disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board.

Mike Barton, chief of Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination center, told reporters in Canberra, Australia, that the wooden pallet spotted by a civilian search aircraft was surrounded by several other nondescript objects, including what appeared to be strapping belts of different colors and lengths.

It was not immediately known if any pallets were used on Flight 370.

Several small objects were identified 2,500km off Australia's west coast, according to a statement released by the country's Maritime Safety Authority.

Sunday's search has been split into two areas, covering 59,000sq/km of ocean thousands of kilometres off the coast of Perth, the authority said.

Prayers for passengers

In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein put a message on his Twitter account Sunday asking those in churches around the country to offer a "prayer please" for the passengers and crew on Fight 370.

More than 300 Malaysian cycling enthusiasts rode their bikes to the Kuala Lumpur airport to remember the people onboard the jet. The cyclists decorated the bikes with small Malaysian flags and stickers that read "Pray for MH370."

Beijing and Tokyo both sent two aircraft to join the six already involved in the operation backed by the US and New Zealand.

A total of 20 emergency service volunteers from western Australia will act as observers during Sunday's mission.

In Beijing, relatives of Chinese passengers, who are waiting for news about their missing plane, accused Malaysian officials of being "deceitful", adding that the meetings were a "waste of time," Al Jazeera's Marga Ortigas reported.

Relatives said they feel Malaysian officials know more than they are saying, our correspondent added.

Investing.com - The pound dropped to nearly five-week lows against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as markets were jittery following reports armed gunmen stormed a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol, although mixed U.S. economic reports did little to support the greenback.

hit 1.6552 during U.S. morning trade, the pair's lowest since February 12; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.6567, retreating 0.42%.

Cable was likely to find support at 1.6426, the low of February 12 and resistance at 1.6666, Monday's high.

The risk-related pound weakened after CNN reported that Vladislav Seleznyov, Ukraine's defense ministry spokesman, said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The comments came during a speech to a joint session of parliament in Moscow, a day after the president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

In the U.S., data showed that the annual rate of inflation slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%. Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

However, U.S. housing starts fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

Sterling was lower against the euro, with rising 0.32% to 0.8395.

Also Tuesday, a report showed that German economic sentiment deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February’s reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.###762||Automaker Toyota has reached a $1 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over the company’s handling of consumer complaints related to unintended vehicle acceleration. CNN reported the agreement would be announced this week, and Toyota is expected to avoid criminal charges.

For the last four years, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan had been investigation allegations that Toyota had misled U.S. authorities after consumer complaints were made about unintended acceleration in its vehicles. As a result of the complaints, Toyota recalled millions of vehicles since 2009. The company has already paid more than $1 billion last year to resolve claims related to the recall.

The potential settlement was first reported by the Wall Street Journal which mentioned, according to its sources, that the settlement would allow Toyota to avoid criminal charges and that an independent monitor will be appointed to manage Toyota’s compliance with the terms of the settlement.

Currently, hundreds of civil lawsuits are pending in the matter and the company is still under an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The “sudden acceleration” issue gained public attention when in 2009 an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer and his family were killed in a crash. The cause was believed to be the gas pedal getting stuck under the floor mat of the car. The officer made desperate calls to 911 prior to the crash and pleaded for advice on how to stop the car. The car went up to 120 mph, then flew off the road and burst into flames, instantly killing everyone inside.

Following the investigations, Toyota recalled more than 10 million vehicles globally, even though the automaker continues to deny any fault in its systems, and pins blame on driver error or sticky gas pedals.

The settlement is estimated to about 1.2 billion dollars and is expected to be officially announced by the Justice Department later on Wednesday.

One of the analysts working for the auto researcher Kelley Blue Book – Mr. Karl Brauer said in a telephone interview that was cited by Bloomberg: “It’s a big number to pay and yet Toyota’s also a company that can most easily digest that kind of a number and move forward.”

The settlement, if actually reached, will put an end to a four-year investigation that is said to be finalized with one of the biggest fines the auto manufacturer ever got. The investigation put a stain on Toyota Motor Corp.’s name, which seriously affected its attempt to become the best selling car manufacturer in the world. The settlement would also help the company improve its positions on the market.

Julie Hamp, who is a spokeswoman of Toyota, said in a statement, which was cited by the Wall Street Journal: “Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years. During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

Ms. Jerika Richardson, who is a spokeswoman of the Manhattan Attorney Preet Bharara refused to make any comments on the rumours whether such a settlement has been reached. The spokeswoman of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York – Kelly Langmesser also declined to comment the situation.

Toyota Motor Corp. settled on Wednesday at 5 508 yen, down 0.76%, marking a one-year change of +11.50%. The world’s largest auto manufacturer is valued at 19.14 trillion yen. According to the Financial Times, the 23 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Toyota Motor Corp. have a median target of 8 000 yen, with a high estimate of 9 600 yen and a low estimate of 6 200 yen. The median estimate represents a 44.14% increase from the previous close of 5 550 yen.###765||Empty###766||Michael Bird

The widely watched investor confidence index calculated by the ZEW economic institute fell by 9.1 points to 46.6 points in March, its lowest level since August 2013, it said in a statement.

"In this month's survey, the Crimea crisis is weighing on experts' economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW president Clemens Fuest.

"Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk," Fuest said.

For the survey, ZEW questions analysts and institutional investors about their current assessment of the economic situation in Germany, as well as their expectations for the coming months.

The sub-index measuring financial market players' view of the current economic situation in Germany rose by 1.3 points to 51.3 points in March, its highest level since August 2011.

A frequent criticism of the ZEW index is that it can be volatile and is therefore not particularly reliable.###774||Originally published March 21, 2014 at 6:14 AM | Page modified March 22, 2014 at 3:26 AM

Interactive: What we know so far

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia —

Malaysia's defense minister says a Chinese satellite has spotted a large object along a broad stretch of ocean where officials hope to find a Malaysia Airlines plane that has been missing for more than two weeks.

Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday that he had been informed that a Chinese satellite had spotted an object 22 meters (72 feet) by 30 meters (100 feet).

He said, "The news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify."

He said he had no other information and that China would release further details. It was not immediately clear whether the object was seen near where another satellite found two objects earlier this week.

Business News###777||The MICEX benchmark was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

Russian president Vladimir Putin watches as Russian stocks were feeling the heat from U.S. sanctions.

Russian stocks were under pressure Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered economic sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin's entourage.

Fears over Russia's economic outlook have ratcheted up this week as the country annexed Crimea following Sunday's hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate and has slapped on sanctions in response.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin's inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin's chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin's lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury's sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia's 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a "personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation."

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that their bank cards are not as useful as they were. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services "without prior notification." SMP's co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia's top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard's actions as "illegitimate" because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won't be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank's. They can also get cash directly inside their banks' branches.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country's central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to "take the bank's clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them."

Describing Rossiya, which was rumored to serve nearly everyone in Putin's close entourage, as "just an average bank," Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one "first thing on Monday" and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia's central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. "does not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability."

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor's in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia's debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia's economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia's BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country's borrowing costs more expensive.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov lambasted the move, saying it was not an objective decision and that somebody "ordered" it.

"Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support," Fitch said.

This was not an insult, however, since he is habitually late. The Russian president once made his (now deposed) Ukrainian counterpart Viktor Yanukovich cool his heels for four hours while he hung out with a biker gang. In the circumstances, making some of the richest people in Russia sit around for a mere 80 minutes was practically a mark of esteem.

Putin spoke for just five minutes and did not find time to mention Ukraine, Crimea, the weakening rouble or the plunging Russian markets. Instead, he focused on a different project—“de-offshore-ization.” It is an ugly word and it sounds, if anything, even uglier in Russian, especially when Putin says it: de-offshorizatsiya. But it is one he likes, and he has been pushing it since 2008.

Story Continued Below

“Russian companies must be registered on our, on their own territory, on the territory of our country and they must have a transparent property structure. I am convinced you are also interested in this,” Putin told his crowd.

What sounds like a rather dry proposal for some changes to Russian financial regulation gained dramatic urgency just minutes later, when the White House issued sanctions against Kremlin insiders. U.S. individuals and companies were suddenly barred from doing business with some of Putin’s best friends.

The impact was immediate. Visa and Mastercard stopped servicing several Russian banks, thus blocking their clients’ ability to use ATMs. When the markets opened the next day in Moscow, shares in companies linked to people on the list plunged. Novatek, a gas company partly owned by the sanctioned Gennady Timchenko, lost 12 percent as investors piled out.

In announcing the sanctions, President Barack Obama spoke of the “costs” they would impose on Putin’s inner circle, and a senior administration official later called them “very powerful” and strongly denied they are “a mere wrist slap.”

The costs to Russia are undoubtedly severe but, as Russian businessmen scramble to get their money out of America’s reach, Putin may be secretly pleased.

Since Russia opened up in the 1990s, Russian businessmen have become adept at using the offshore banking sectors of the world to hide their wealth. In this, they are no different than Western businesses, who also park their cash places where their governments can’t get at it, but they do it on a totally different scale.

According to the most recent figures from the Russian Central Bank (for the third quarter of last year), the biggest investor in the country was Cyprus ($4.5 billion), followed by the British Virgin Islands ($2.7 billion), Luxembourg ($1.6 billion) and the isle of Jersey—all of which are generally considered to be tax havens. China, Russia’s most powerful neighbour, invested $193 million during the quarter, less than Bermuda. Germany invested $428 million, little more than half the total from the Bahamas.

This is not Bahamian money, earned by hard-working hoteliers and invested in Russia in the hope of good returns. It is Russian money, part of the vast outflow that has left the country in the last two decades, and come to rest in bank accounts around the world. Last year, $63 billion left Russia. Thanks to the post-Crimea political turbulence, financial analysts predict that 2014’s total will be double that.

This not only impoverishes Russia, it also complicates Putin’s task of bringing everything in the country within his reach—hence, his desire to de-offshore-ize it.

“The oligarchs become much more beholden to him if their money is effectively under his control. They go from being independently wealthy to ‘dependently wealthy,’” Bill Browder, who was a huge portfolio investor in Russia in Putin’s early years, but who was barred from entering the country in 2006, told me. “Going forward Putin wants them to depend on him to maintain their wealth and not have it taken away.”

Since coming to power, Putin has made it his goal to restore the Kremlin’s power: by crushing Chechnya, by cancelling elections, by controlling the media and by squashing over-mighty oligarchs who felt they could challenge him.

It still finished with a solid weekly gain, up 1.4 percent.It might sound surprising that the stock market is trading near an all-time high with all the uncertainty surrounding China's slowing growth and simmering tensions between Russia and the West. Last week, those concerns were credited with knocking the S&P 500 index down 1.9 percent, its worst weekly loss in nearly two months.This week investors seemed to return their focus to the basics."There are always bad things going on in the world, but they don't all matter to the ultimate direction of markets," said Douglas Coté, chief market strategist at ING U.S. Investment Management. "The only thing that matters is the following: corporate earnings, manufacturing and the consumer. And they've all been solid."The S&P 500 slipped 5.49 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,866.52 Friday.

Biogen Idec fell $28.51, or 8 percent, to $318.53.Nike fell after warning that a stronger U.S. dollar will dampen its results this quarter. Still, strong demand for its shoes and apparel ahead of the World Cup in June helped it beat analysts' earnings expectations in the previous quarter, the company said late Thursday. Nike, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, lost $4.06, or 5 percent, to $75.21.Earlier in the week, reports on manufacturing and housing sent the stock market higher. The big stumble came Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve said it could start raising short-term interest rates as soon as next year. Traders drove down prices for gold, government bonds and stocks in anticipation of higher interest rates and borrowing costs.Those market jitters overshadowed some good news, said Dan Veru, chief investment officer of Palisade Capital Management in Fort Lee, N.J."If interest rates are going higher it's because the economy is doing better," he said, "and that's going to be a good thing for corporate profits. What's so bad about that?"In other trading Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.74 percent. Crude oil rose 56 cents to close at $99.46 a barrel.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony PlayStation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion preowned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and iPad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” Mac Naughton said.

The threat came in the middle of a particularly fiery speech, even for Erdoğan, who wields a nuclear arsenal of angry declarations and allegations. “We now have a court order,” he said. “We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. They will see the power of the Turkish Republic.”

Just before midnight, as though yielding directly to the force of Erdoğan’s fury, Turkey became one of only two countries in the world to block Twitter entirely. (The other is China.) Four separate court orders prevent Turkish Internet service providers from connecting to Twitter’s servers, making it impossible to access the service.

Twitter has been a target of Erdoğan’s increasing anger since May of 2013, when the social-media platform was used to help organize the anti-government protests that spread from Istanbul’s Gezi Park throughout Turkey. Back then, he called Twitter a “scourge.” Even before Gezi, individuals were occasionally prosecuted for tweets that were considered blasphemous or were found to “incite hatred.” In February, the Azeri journalist Mahir Zeynalov was deported from Turkey for two tweets. When a controversial investigation into government corruption, launched in December, was effectively blocked in the courts, information described as “suppressed evidence” began to be leaked online by opponents of Erdoğan, often using Twitter. One particularly explosive recording purports to feature an anxious conversation between Erdoğan and his son Bilal about hiding millions of dollars from investigators.

A pamphlet called “Everybody Should Know These Facts,” recently distributed throughout Istanbul by Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (A.K.P.), warns readers to beware of false news that is spread on Twitter—where, Erdoğan alleged last month, his government was being assailed by a “robot lobby.” It’s obvious that the Prime Minister views Twitter as a serious threat to his leadership. It’s harder to know why he thinks blocking it is a good move.

This morning, when I reached Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor at Istanbul’s Bilgi University and an expert in cyberlaw, he was at a conference in Ankara on Internet freedom. “Blocking access to Twitter is the worst kind of censorship one can imagine,” he wrote in an e-mail. “Absence of these social media platforms will be seen as a significant democratic deficit in Turkey. Certainly, it casts a dark shadow over Turkey’s democratization process and potential EU membership.” What it does not do, unfortunately for Erdoğan, is prevent people from using Twitter.

According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, fourteen per cent of Turkey’s eighty million people use Twitter—a relatively high figure for a country where only forty-five per cent of the population uses the Internet. Shortly after news outlets reported the ban, articles about how to circumvent it began to circulate widely, and the hashtags #twitterisblockedinturkey and #turkeyblockedtwitter were among Twitter’s trending keywords worldwide. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder, retweeted the company’s advice—in Turkish—about how to post tweets using S.M.S., while other Turks on Twitter sang the praises of their V.P.N. services, which bypass local Internet providers. According to a company that tracks Twitter use in Turkey, more than half a million tweets were posted in the first ten hours after the ban took effect, roughly in line with normal daily activity. Even members of the A.K.P. appeared to breach the ban, including Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç, who announced his campaign schedule on Twitter.

Among ordinary users, anger mixed with mockery. Many people posted a drawing of Erdoğan spraying a black cloud of insecticide at the blue bird that is Twitter’s logo. Another popular illustration turned the white crescent on the Turkish flag into a Pac-Man about to eat the bird. A photo of Erdoğan on the phone has the Prime Minister asking the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, “I’m blocking Twitter. Then what?” Representatives from the European Union and the United States have already condemned the ban, as have human-rights groups—but Erdoğan claims not to care about the international community.

Among Erdoğan’s critics and among journalists in Turkey, the ban only serves to demonstrate how tone-deaf the A.K.P. has become in its zeal for message control. The move against Twitter looks desperate and, given how accessible the service remains, futile—the sort of clumsy measure that authoritarian leaders often take as they witness their power draining away. (The last time I woke up to news of Twitter being blocked was three years ago, in Cairo, when it was ordered by Hosni Mubarak.) But the ban also highlights a disturbing trend in Erdoğan’s attitude toward the opposition, and signals that the authoritarian tendencies that surfaced during last year’s Gezi protests are only growing stronger. Local elections are set to be held in nine days, and the atmosphere is tense.

Yesterday, before the ban went into effect, the journalist and author Mustafa Akyol wrote about the A.K.P.’s reëlection campaign for the news site Al-Monitor. In the article, called “Erdoğan’s Great Patriotic War,” Akyol dissects a campaign video that in grand, dramatic strokes implies that there are forces inside Turkey that are intent on dismantling the nation, and only Erdoğan, along with the unwavering support of Turkish citizens, can stop them. “No words are spoken other than Erdoğan’s excerpt from the national anthem,” Akyol says, “but for all Turks who see it, the message is all too obvious: Erdoğan’s political opponents are not only attacking him, they are attacking the nation itself. Turkish patriots must unite against these most wicked of enemies.”

In February, the Turkish parliament passed a bill, which President Abdullah Gül later signed into law, that gave the government broad control over the Internet, including the ability to block sites without a court order and to collect and retain user histories. When the law was first passed, I interviewed Geoffrey King and Nina Ognianova, of the Committee to Protect Journalists. They were both dismayed by the new law, and, though Twitter was still unblocked, it was already clear that online speech was not entirely free. At that point, China was the only country still blocking Twitter, and neither King nor Ognianova anticipated a complete ban in Turkey—which, after all, still hoped to join the E.U. “Losing a platform like Twitter, even if it’s replaced by another, is a disaster for both regular citizens and professional journalists,” King told me. In a separate conversation, Ognianova was equally direct. “In the past few years, Turkey has gone from a country that’s been considered a regional hope to a country that’s now considered a regional concern,” she said. “That’s characterized by a shrinking space for freedom of expression.”

Colorado’s Amendment 64 bars legislators from lobbying state officials for two years after they leave office. But there’s nothing that stops former department directors from going to work for the industry they regulated.

Matt Cook and Laura Harris’ jobs were to enforce the rules and regulations of Colorado’s marijuana industry. Now both of them are working for it.

The news about Harris comes in a release from Denver Relief Consulting that states “former cannabis enforcement chief joins firm.”

The release does not state exactly what Harris, the former head of marijuana enforcement, will do but cites her background in regulatory compliance.

Elena Nunez is State Executive Director of Common Cause, a non-partisan organization that works for credible government.

“There are a couple of problems potentially. One, they have specialized knowledge of the agency and its processes and they also have special relationships that can influence their ability to get approval for contracts contributions or other things,” said Nunez.

Matt Cook was spotlighted on the CBS news program “60 Minutes.”

“Matt Cook, a former narcotics officer, wrote the law and served as the state’s first director of enforcement,” they said.

Cook is now a consultant to the marijuana industry with the 60 Minutes interview displayed on his website. His credentials include Senior Director of Enforcement for the Colorado Department of Revenue.

“We need to make sure those folks who are privy to confidential information about the industry or client matters. Maintain that confidentiality and privilege,” said State Rep. and Assistant House Majority Leader Dan Pabon.

Harris and Cook could not be reached for comment. The governor’s office said it found no legal or ethical breach on their part.###792||Empty###793||Empty###794||The Royal Mint is taking on the counterfeiters by replacing the humble £1 coin – but businesses say there is a flipside

In today's budget, the UK Chancellor, George Osborne, will announce the replacement of the £1 coin from 2017 amid concerns about the current design's vulnerability to counterfeiting.

The new coin will be based on the threepenny bit that disappeared from circulation after decimalisation in the 1970s, with designers claiming it will be "the most secure in the world".

Why is it being changed?

The rounded £1 coin has been in use since 1983, with £1.5bn in circulation in March 2013, but ministers say the old technology used to make the coins makes it too easy for counterfeiters to copy. The new design will be in the same gold and silver colours as the euro and is particularly hard to copy. "With advances in technology making high-value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency," said Osborne.

How big a problem are fake coins?

The Royal Mint estimates that around 3% of the £1 coins are fake – which could mean more than £45m worth of counterfeit coins are in circulation. Individuals and companies are not allowed to pass on coins they know to be counterfeit, so ending up with fakes can be costly.

Will the new coin fit parking and vending machines?

Not as it stands, according to the Royal Mint. Andrew Mills, the head of circulation for the Mint, told the BBC it was "a likelihood" that the coin would not fit in machines designed for the existing £1. The new coin will not be accepted by many automated vending and ticket machines and may not fit in supermarket trolley or locker slots.

The change could prove expensive for firms and councils needing to alter parking meters, vending machines and shopping trolleys. When new, thicker 5p and 10p coins were introduced in 2012, town halls complained that the switch could cost them £5.5m.

Won't it be a similar size?

Yes. But the need to change machines may arise from the "metal composition" of the new coin, according to Jo Audley of the British Parking Association. "The current security elements built into machines are designed to measure the metal composition of the coin," she says. "So if they're considered conterfeit or the machine fails to read the composition correctly, they are rejected. At present, 4% of £1 coins used in parking meters are counterfeit. We need to to ascertain what metals are being used and how this recallibrates into the machine, and we don't know yet."

The cost of a change, if needed, will depend on what parts in the current machines need altering, and how this is rolled out across different parking schemes, but the association says all machines, of which there are around 100,000, could need changing. "A lot of companies are using cashless systems through mobile apps and credit card payments," said Audley.

If the machines are upgraded from a standard coin-operated machine to offering a cashless payments, this will push up the cost of upgrading, she added.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

What about businesses?

The cost is expected to mainly fall on firms operating around 400,000 machines – selling anything from train tickets to snacks – while payphones, fruit machines and supermarket trolleys will also have to be changed.

A spokesman for the British Retail Consortium welcomed the news but said: "It is important for industry that any potential change is effectively planned and managed in order to minimise hardware costs for business. The BRC will engage with both the government and the Royal Mint to support a smooth transition period."

John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: "Small firms who deal with low-priced items are more likely to be affected by fake currency but we do have concerns about the extra costs of introducing a new pound coin. For example, small firms may have to pay out to replace machinery. But, there's no doubt counterfeit coins and notes can seriously damage small businesses. Not only are they worthless but a business could be prosecuted if it passes them on."

How much will the change cost?

The Royal Mint has not said how much it will cost to make the new coins, but it says £2m has so far been invested in developing the new security techniques used on the machines. Mills said 90% of the changes were likely to be straightforward, and cost around £10 to £12 per machine, and that cost of changing all the machines in the country is likely to between £15 and £20m.

However the British Parking Association says just changing parking machines could cost £50m. And, of course, there's also the cost to consumers of replacing all those trolley token keyrings.###795||Latest Stories

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers eligible for Obamacare health plans could see double-digit price hikes next year in states that fail to draw large numbers of enrollees for 2014, including some states that have been hostile to the healthcare law, according to insurance industry officials and analysts.

The early estimates come as insurance companies set out to design plans they intend to sell in 2015 through the state-based health insurance marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement that is widely referred to as Obamacare.

WellPoint Inc, which sells plans on 14 Obamacare exchanges, expects health insurance rates nationwide to be higher. Increases for the Obamacare market that has signed up about 5 million people to date is expected to outpace those in the employer-sponsored market, which serves about 170 million people.

"Looking at the rate increases on a year-over-year basis on our exchanges, and it will vary by carrier, but all of them will probably be in double digit plus," Ken Goulet, president of WellPoint's commercial business, told investors in New York on Friday.

The cost of health insurance is already a political hot potato in this year's election campaign for control of Congress, with Republicans warning of the potential for sky-rocketing rates in their attempt to turn the ballot into a referendum on Obamacare.

Insurers have noted the difficulty of building and pricing plans for 2015, which will mark the second year of the Obamacare exchanges. Enrollment for 2014 closes on March 31, giving them very little time to review the costs of covering their new members before submitting proposed rates to insurance regulators in May and June.

Industry officials and independent analysts say the lack of hard data will mean huge variations in premiums, with increases ranging from the high single-digit percentages in some states to as much as 30 percent in others.

Slow enrollment is a potential harbinger of big price hikes in over a dozen states, where technology failures or political opposition to Obamacare may have deterred younger and healthier residents from signing up.

Because the healthcare law prevents insurers from charging sick people higher premiums, the participation of healthy young people is needed to offset the cost of covering policyholders with preexisting conditions. Government data so far has shown about 25 percent of new Obamacare enrollees are in the younger demographic of adults aged 18 to 34, well below the White House's 38 percent target before last October's botched rollout.

Government actuaries predict an 8 percent increase in overall net insurance costs next year. Last week, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional committee: "I think premiums are likely to go up, but go up at a slower pace than what we've seen since 2010."

Some analysts say the more dire industry expectations reflect companies' uncertainty rather than the true costs of the market.

"I think it'll be the exception. But there will be some sections of the country with significantly higher insurance premiums," said Larry Levitt, a policy expert at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks healthcare trends.

Levitt predicts that most states will see premium increases of 7 percent to 10 percent in 2015, as insurers compensate for factors including the rising cost of medical services and reduced funding for a temporary federal program that compensates insurers for high claim costs.

COMPETITIVE PRESSURE

Levitt and other analysts said competition between plans should also brake upward price momentum in most states, while some consumers should also benefit from aggressive state insurance regulators unwilling to allow big cost hikes.

Even after the end of open enrollment, a steady stream of new customers is expected to transition into the Obamacare marketplaces throughout 2014, due to life changes that allow for special enrollments, including job loss, marriage and parenthood. As a result, insurers could find themselves under constant pressure to keep prices competitive.

"There's going to be this continuing need to market and get new enrollees," said Sarah Thomas, research director at the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions.###798||Posted Tuesday, March 18, 2014 7:56 am

Vermont's unemployment rate fell again in January, dropping to 4 percent.

The rate is low compared to the 6.6 percent national average - the fifth-lowest in the nation and the lowest in New England.

It was the fourth monthly decrease in a row in the state's unemployment rate, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. And the state gained about 350 workers - the first increase in the labor force since late 2011, though the numbers are subject to revision.

"The January numbers start the year on a positive note," Labor Commissioner Annie Noonan said in a news release. "Hopefully we continue to grow a resilient economy with diverse employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for Vermonters. We are still working to ensure that all Vermonters can access employment opportunities and achieve wage growth."

The unemployment rate and labor force estimates are based on household surveys conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics before IBM announced its latest round of layoffs in late February. Any job losses from the Essex Junction plant likely will not surface before March numbers are released in April. February's report is due out in late March.

One of Vermont's economic challenges is the size of the work force. With the exception of January's preliminary numbers, the labor force has dipped in recent years after decades of solid growth.

Moody's Investors Service named the downward trend in job growth as one of Vermont's primary credit challenges in its October 2013 assessment of the state's credit rating. The state's rapidly aging population - a major factor in the overall labor trends - also topped the list of negative credit factors.

The ratings agency's sister company, Moody's Analytics, credits the tourism and food processing industries with helping to keep the state's economy afloat in the short-term.

Seasonally adjusted state data show a 6.8 percent increase in leisure and hospitality jobs since January 2013: the arts, entertainment and recreation sector gained about 600 jobs. Accommodations and food services filled about 800 positions. Food manufacturing is also up.

Durable goods manufacturing led the seasonally adjusted declines in 2013, shedding 6.5 percent, or 1,400 jobs. Construction is also down, by about 2.1 percent, or 300 jobs, since last January.###799||Leading the potential new fund-raising round is TPG Growth, the investment firm that already has a stake in the car-ride service Uber, the people briefed on the matter said. Other prospective investors include the Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, one of these people added. The discussions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are continuing and may still fall apart, these people cautioned. Despite murmurs of a new technology bubble, valuations appear to be rising unchecked. Last month, Facebook — itself worth nearly $US170 billion — paid more than $US16 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp, a bid that some analysts have described as reasonable given the acquired company’s growth prospects. Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $US10 billion, while Palantir, a sophisticated data analysis firm, has raised money at a $US9 billion valuation. The pace of investments appears to be accelerating. Venture capital firms spent $8 billion in the last three months of 2013 investing in the likes of Pinterest, the fast-growing social network, according to data from CB Insights. The hope, as ever, is that these start-ups will eventually be sold or go public at still higher valuations. “I’ve never seen people so encouraged,” said Colin Blaydon, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “There will be big winners, and investors don’t want to miss out.”

Others view the valuation race more skeptically. “We’re seeing valuations go nuts,” said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Even so, Mr Ellis conceded that many of the companies now enjoying the limelight are a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many start-ups now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits. Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities. Airbnb makes money by taking a cut of each transaction. With 600,000 listings on the company’s site, that could translate into significant revenue. The company doesn’t disclose its financial information.

Under the business model, one shared with Uber, homes and cars are not just possessions but potential sources of revenue. The model also allows customers to pay lower rates than those charged by traditional service providers like hotels. But with the disruption that companies like Airbnb and Uber promise comes greater legal scrutiny. Airbnb has faced challenges from regulators concerned that the service allows homeowners and renters to avoid paying taxes. Other government agencies are investigating whether these start-ups run afoul of state laws governing rentals. New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, has subpoenaed Airbnb for information on customers in the state who he suspects may be illicitly using its services for their main income. Airbnb has moved in court to quash the information request; a hearing is scheduled for next week. And Uber has battled taxi and limousine commissions in a number of places, including Washington, where the established industries have argued that the service violates local regulations. Those potential hurdles have failed to daunt prospective investors. TPG Growth, for example, participated in a fund-raising round for Uber last year that valued the service at $3.8 billion.



Investors are betting that Airbnb will continue to show enormous growth. Its last fund-raising round, in 2012, valued the company at $US2.5 billion. Should its latest efforts to raise capital succeed, it will carry a higher valuation than Wyndham Worldwide, whose market capitalisation stands at $US9.3 billion, or Hyatt, whose market value is $8.4 billion.

The round would also put a valuation on Airbnb more than twice that of HomeAway, a publicly traded vacation rental company that carried a value of $US3.8 billion as of Thursday. Airbnb’s current investor roll reads like a list of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture capital firms. Among them: Sequoia Capital, the only outside investor in WhatsApp; Andreessen Horowitz, an early backer of Facebook; Founders Fund; and even the actor Ashton Kutcher. The New York Times###800||(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc will allow U.S. shoppers to trade in used videogames for anything from groceries to gadgets, a move that could dent the profit of GameStop Corp, the largest dealer of used videogames.

GameStop shares fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said on Tuesday its trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp's PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp's Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam's Club.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The move would pit Wal-Mart against retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, besides GameStop, which also have trade-in programs for used videogames. Such games are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

"We know that WMT "invests in price" ... and we expect GME will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share," Schick wrote in a note to clients.

GameStop has already warned of sagging sales of games played on older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Sales of videogame products such as consoles have been pressured by lower-priced online offerings and as gamers spend more time on tablet computers and phones.

GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87.

Though the company thinks only 25,000 were hit, but why this keeps happening is the real question.

Sally Beauty Stores Another Victim of Data Breach, 25,000 Customers Affected

Sally Beauty Supply is a beauty supply store that sells professional beauty products usually only sold to salons, to the public. It is a publicly traded company that has over 4,000 stores in many countries.

The breach was discovered on March 5 and is believed to have only affected 25,000 customer’s debit and credit card information. The company is looking into the breach with a private investigation firm and the U.S. Secret Service to make sure that the right precautions are taken to prevent future breaches and protect those whose information has already been compromised.

Security breaches on consumer information have become all too familiar lately and are making consumers wary of where they shop. Around Christmas time, Target had a large data breach into the information of their customers as well and it seemed like the breaches kept coming through ever since. What consumers once believed to be secure systems to make purchases with, have been proven otherwise in the last few months. Will new systems be put into place for retail stores to become more secure? As less and less people tend to use paper money, it is certain something needs to be done.

Security software maker Symantec has terminated the services of its President and CEO Steve Bennett, the second such decision by the company in a span of two years.

The company, however, did not disclose the reasons for the move.

Symantec has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO with immediate effect.

"This appointment follows the termination of Steve Bennett as the company's president and CEO and his resignation from Symantec's board of directors," Symantec said in a statement.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a leading executive search firm, it added.

"Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," Symantec Chairman Daniel Schulman said.

Bennett was roped in to head the US-based firm in July 2012 when its then President and CEO Enrique Salem was asked to leave the company after a 19 year association with Symantec, including three years as the CEO.

"It was the board's judgement that it was in the best interests of Symantec to make a change in the CEO," Symantec had said.

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with VERITAS Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of Quantum Corporation.

As interim president and CEO, Brown will work with Symantec's executive team to facilitate an orderly leadership transition while overseeing the company's ongoing transformation.

He will remain on Symantec's board, but will no longer serve on its compensation and leadership development committee or nominating and governance committee.

Board member Robert S Miller will replace Brown as the chair of the compensation and leadership development committee.###806||Empty###807||The Justice Department is expected to announce a settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. as early as Wednesday that could cost the auto maker more than $1 billion to end a criminal probe into its disclosure of safety issues, people familiar with the matter said.

Reuters

The deal would cap a four-year investigation with one of the largest fines ever imposed on an auto maker.

It is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement which would allow Toyota 7203, +2.09% TM, -0.04% to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, and would appoint an external monitor to oversee Toyota’s adherence to conditions of the agreement, the people said.

The settlement isn’t final and could still fall apart, some of these people said.

A spokeswoman for Toyota said Toyota had already moved to address many of the issues raised in the investigation.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The investigation has been headed by the Manhattan offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney and focused on the way Toyota disclosed issues related to allegations of unintended acceleration in its cars in the late 2000s.

This effort is aimed at preventing another collapse of a Bitcoin exchange, like what happened to Japan's Mt Gox, according to VentureBeat.

A note about the software update read: "If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux). If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run 0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine. On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin client first, especially if you are switching to the 64-bit version."

The updated Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 now has five modifications that will protect the cryptocurrency from future attacks. The previous version had a flaw that overlooked mutated Bitcoin transactions. Because of that, the records on the Bitcoin blockchain did not match that of Mt Gox's, Gizmodo explained.

The modified software now prevents relaying or mining of those mutated transactions. In addition, the software now promptly reports any irregularities in wallet transactions, the report noted.###809||Empty###810||On March 20, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told his parliament that objects had been spotted in waters hundreds of kilometres off the western Australian coast. Further searches, by Australian, New Zealand and US planes, were needed to find out if they were part of the missing plane.

Others have speculated that the pilot or co-pilot may have intentionally crashed the plane. The FBI is trying to restore deleted simulator-flights from Pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah's computer – but these could be innocuous. Critics of the crash theory say neither the pilot nor co-pilot had ever expressed any kind of radical sentiment or displayed mental issues, and both possessed adequate flying experience.

Theories abound. Fellow pilot Chris Goodfellow has suggested that a tyre may have caught fire, causing the pilots to turn towards the closest suitable airport, with the rapid ascent and descent perhaps representing an attempt to extinguish the fire. Critics of this theory have pointed out that the change in path was programmed into the plane's computer 12 minutes before the calm toned "good night" transmission, suggesting the change in course was planned.

At 1.30am, on point 4, the plane is spotted for the last time on civilian radar. At 2.15am, on point 5, military radar spots it, although it is not clear at the time that this was MH370. Satellite data suggests the plane could also have angled towards point 6.

Forensic experts examining the home flight simulator of Malaysia Airlines pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah have found nothing suspicious, collapsing the only significant lead investigators have been pursuing to try to solve the mystery disappearance of MH370, police sources say.

Investigators became suspicious last week when they discovered Zaharie, 53, had deleted logs on a computer linked to the simulator on February 3, almost five weeks before the Boeing 777 with 239 people on board inexplicably turned around during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, and was still flying more than seven hours later.

The computer hard drive was sent to FBI experts in the US to search for evidence of some kind of hijacking plot.

Zaharie and his co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, have been a key focus of investigations after Malaysian authorities said they believed a “deliberate action” by someone on board caused the plane to lose communications and then turn around from its scheduled flight path.

Intensive scrutiny of Zaharie’s background has failed uncover any links to extremists groups or terrorism.

Investigations have also failed to find anything suspicious in the background of Fariq, who was due soon to marry another pilot.

Malaysia's acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein was expected to announce that police had found nothing suspicious on the simulator at a media briefing in Kuala Lumpur late on Saturday, Malaysian time.

Australia has cautioned that their investigations in the southern Indian Ocean remained a tentative one.



Officials are bracing for the "long haul" as searches by more than two dozen countries turn up little but frustration and fresh questions about Flight MH370 which vanished on a scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8.



Six aircraft and two merchant ships are now scouring an area of the remote southern Indian Ocean where suspected debris was spotted by satellite earlier this week.



Australia, which announced the potential find and is coordinating the rescue, has cautioned the objects might be a lost shipping container or other debris.



"Even though this is not a definite lead, it is probably more solid than any other lead around the world and that is why so much effort and interest is being put into this search," acting Australian Prime Minister Warren Truss told reporters at a Perth airforce base.



China, Japan and India are sending more planes and Australian and Chinese navy vessels are also steaming towards the zone, more than 2,000km southwest of Perth.



Weather conditions are good, with 10 km of visibility, according to search officials - a crucial boost for a search that is relying more on human eyes than the technical wizardry of the most advanced aircraft in the world.



"While these aircraft are equipped with very advanced technology, much of this search is actually visual," said Truss, who also warned that the objects detected by satellites may now be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.



"It is a very remote area, but we intend to continue the search until we are absolutely satisfied that further searching would be futile, and that day is not in sight," he said.



Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman John Young said the operation was still considered search and rescue.



"The plan is we want to find these objects because they are the best lead to where we might find people to be rescued," he said.



CLOCK TICKING



Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said searchers were facing the "long haul" but were conscious that the clock was ticking. The plane's "black box" voice and data recorder only transmits an electronic signal for about 30 days before its battery dies, after which it will be far more difficult to locate.



Aircraft and ships have also renewed the search in the Andaman Sea between India and Thailand, going over areas that have already been exhaustively swept to find some clue to unlock one of the biggest mysteries in modern aviation.



Investigators suspect the Boeing 777, which took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing shortly after midnight on March 8, was deliberately diverted thousands of miles from its scheduled path. They say they are focusing on hijacking or sabotage but have not ruled out technical problems.



The Telegraph newspaper published what it said was a transcript of communications between the cockpit of Flight MH370 and Malaysian air control, but few if any new clues emerged.



The search itself has strained ties between China and Malaysia, with Beijing repeatedly leaning on the Southeast Asian nation to step up its hunt and do a better job at looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers.



For families of the passengers, the process has proved to be an emotionally wrenching battle to elicit information, their angst fuelled by a steady stream of speculation and false leads.



Some experts have argued that the reluctance to share sensitive radar data and capabilities in a region fraught with suspicion amid China's military rise and territorial disputes may have hampered the search.



Two people familiar with the investigation said the search had been slowed in some cases by delays over the paperwork to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request.



Truss said he was grateful for the search craft offered by China and others, which are expected to arrive at the Australian airforce base on Saturday.



Australian rescue coordinators said they are awaiting confirmation of the planes and ships offered before they are included in any search schedules.

-Reuters and Fairfax Australia###811||Walmart has announced that it will serve the 110 million gamers across the U.S. by allowing them to ,”unlock value in their current purchases and save even more when it comes to one of the fastest-growing forms of entertainment.”



Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.



“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”



How it Works

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary.



Certified Pre-Owned Video Games in Stores Later this Year



Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com. The video games will be labeled “Certified Pre-Owned” which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.



“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” added Mac Naughton.###812||Empty###813||Why did this happen?

New Jersey's unemployment rate fell to 7.1 percent in January, according to preliminary data the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released this morning. But the state lost an estimated 3,900 jobs in the process.

The unemployment rate is nearly two points lower than a year ago, the data show. In January 2014, the jobless rate stood at 8.9 percent.

The January rate also is a notch below the revised 7.2 percent rate that New Jersey tallied in December.

But the preliminary data show that the state had 3.9249 million jobs in January. That's just 5,600 more jobs than January of 2013, when the state reported 3.9193 million jobs.

A report from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development out this morning with "benchmarked" revisions to the 2013 data shows that the state gained 18,800 jobs last year, all within the private sector. The public sector shrank by 1,000 jobs last year, the data also show.

That's stronger than earlier estimates. A preliminary report released in January showed New Jersey may have only gained 10,100 jobs last year.

One thing that’s made with superior spit and finesse in the U.S. is the spirit of luring customers from the competition. And so it is that even as Walmart ramps up its patriotic advertising campaign — as Marketing Daily’s Sarah Mahoney reports this morning — it is also setting out to steal market share from GameStop and lesser entities that deal in the rapidly expanding cosmos of used videogames.

The retailer “is expected to announce on Tuesday that starting March 26 it will begin allowing customers to convert old games into store credits in over 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, most of its locations in the United States,” Nick Wingfield writes in the New York Times. “The program represents a major push by Walmart into a lucrative segment of the games business, one that games publishers have unsuccessfully sought to stymie in the past because of the potential threat used games represent to new game sales.”

In advance of that “announcement,” Walmart executives told reporters on a call yesterday that it is partnering with CExchange — which already handles its smartphone and tablet trade-in program and also works with the likes of Microsoft, RadioShack and eBay — to administer the program.

“The mega-chain will be taking in just games, not hardware, and will be refurbishing the games for sale in stores and online,” Evan Narcisse reports on Kotaku.

“The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older,” writes CNNMoney’s Parija Kavilanz.

Walmart estimates consumers shell out $2 billion annually buying used games. It says “extra cash from used games will give customers money to spend on newer ones, which typically cost about $60 apiece,” Ian Sherr and Shelly Banjo report in the Wall Street Journal.

But that “extra cash” comes in the form of Walmart gift cards that customers cannot spend at McDonald’s — or whatever mom-and-pop survives down Central Ave. — creating a self-perpetuating profit scenario. The other part of the economics of the program is a no-brainer.

“It’s extremely rare if retailers can find a category that has such high gross-profit margins,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson tells Wingfield.

But Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton says it’s just focusing on its customers’ wants and needs. “We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,” Mac Naughton told reporters on the call yesterday.

He added that “the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ‘inflection point’ following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year,” Andrea Cheng reports on Market Watch.

“There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It’s today’s form of entertainment,” says Mac Naughton.

GameStop, which “has dominated the used video game business for 15 years, and returned $1 billion in trade credits to its customers last year,” as the Dallas Morning News’ Maria Halkias writes, seems almost nonchalant about the wolf at its door. Its “retail network and family of brands include 6,488 company-operated stores in 15 countries worldwide and online at www.GameStop.com,” according to its investor relations site.

“We have faced many competitors in the past who have tried to enter into the buy-sell-trade model, and GameStop has continued to come out on top,” it said in a statement reacting to the Walmart news. “Given our expertise, we will continue to win the battles. We’ve beat out other large retailers when they’ve entered the category. We are confident we will continue to do so.”

Citing the complexity successfully executing a trade-in business model, GameStop CEO Paul Raines tells the WSJ’s Sheer and Banjo, “We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time.”

Indeed, Walmart has played and lost at a beta of this game. It tested a program in 2009 “that collected games through vending machines and gave money back on a credit or debit card, but that program raised concerns about fraud,” Heather Somerville reports in the San Jose Mercury News. It shut the program down and “has since been working to create a simpler and fairer” system.

If there one thing we all know about the tech market, it’s that yesterday’s hits are today’s giveaways. Asked about the growth of downloadable gaming, Mac Naughton told GameSpot’s Eddie Makuch that Walmart “isn't worried because bandwidth into homes is still an issue for many,” although it has it eyes fixed on the game even as it changes.

“We think being on the shoulders of disruptive tech is good,” he said. “We're ready to grow into digital as that business emerges.”###820||Last Updated: 19 Mar 2014

The current circular £1 coin has become an easy target for forgers and will be replaced by a 12-sided version, chancellor George Osborne will say in the Budget today.

Introduced from 2017, the new pound coin will be the same shape as the 'threepenny bit' which went out of use in 1971. The Treasury says it will save taxpayers money by cutting down on fraud -the Royal Mint estimates there are about 45 million fake £1 coins in circulation.

'The current £1 coin design is now more than thirty years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time,' said Adam Lawrence, Chief Executive of The Royal Mint.

The new £1 coin will still have the queen's head on one side, and there will be a public competition to design the 'tails' side of the coin.

The 12-sided version will be constructed from two different coloured metals and contain an iSIS security feature - a new high security coinage currency system developed by The Royal Mint.

However, the new coin is estimated to cost £20m to introduce, Andrew Mills, director of circulation for the Royal Mint, told BBC Radio 4 this morning.

This is mainly due to the fact that the new coins will need to be accepted in supermarket trolleys, parking meters and vending machines, he said. 'We want to make the transition as smooth as possible'.

Last year the Bank of England announced the UK will switch to plastic pound notes from 2016, ending 320 years of paper money.

The new 'polymer' notes will start with a new £5 note featuring Winston Churchill in 2016 and the Jane Austen £10 a year later.###821||Empty###822||Oh no! Page not found

LONDON, United Kingdom — Mulberry Group Plc said Bruno Guillon will step down as chief executive officer after two years during which the British luxury handbag maker lost two-thirds of its market value.

Guillon, who joined Mulberry from Hermes International SCA in March 2012, will leave immediately, Somerset, England-based Mulberry said today in a statement. Former CEO Godfrey Davis, the company’s non-executive chairman, will become executive chairman until a successor is found, Mulberry said.

Guillon’s plan to raise prices and expand Mulberry globally failed to resonate with consumers. In January, Mulberry said profit would be substantially below estimates because of weak sales in the U.K. and order cancellations in South Korea.

Mulberry creative director Emma Hill, who was credited with driving the company’s growth with bags such as the Alexa, quit last year after disagreeing with Guillon on strategy, a person familiar with the situation said at the time.

The shares fell 2.1 percent to 636.5 pence yesterday in London. They have slumped 67 percent since Guillon joined.

This means that Russian citizens will no longer be able to use their credit and debit cards branded with the Visa and MasterCard logo – including to withdraw cash at ATMs. Russian consumers t can still withdraw cash from the banks.

Bank Rossiya, Russia’s 15th largest, was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list following actions put in place by President Obama on Thursday in the wake of Russia’s actions in the Ukraine.

Putin joked that while he didn’t maintain an account at Bank Rossiya, he planned to open one. Russia’s central bank brushed off any implications that these actions would threaten the bank’s stability, but did suggest that Russian government would do what’s necessary to “support the lender and the interests of its depositors and creditors.”

Fitch, the ratings agency, warned that the consequences of Visa and MasterCard’s actions may force Russia’s already marginal credit rating (BBB) lower. These actions may impinge the interest of other countries to lend Russia money, potentially increasing its borrowing costs.

March 20 (Reuters) - Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is in advanced talks with private equity firms including TPG Capital Management LP to raise funds that would value the company at about $10 billion, a person briefed on the matter said Thursday.

TPG is likely to lead the funding round, which could exceed $400 million. Texas-based TPG recently made a large investment in ride-sharing company Uber, another major player in the burgeoning sector known as the sharing economy.

The Airbnb talks were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. (r.reuters.com/fup77v)

Airbnb, whose website rental listings range from private rooms to manors and islands, has become one of Silicon Valley’s most successful start-ups in the five years since it was founded by a trio of graduates from the Rhode Island School of Design and Harvard.

But its foray into the hospitality business has been met with controversy in critical markets like New York state, which prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present. The company remains locked in a legal battle with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Airbnb for information about its hosts in the state last year to determine which were in violation of state law.

The San Francisco city attorney’s office has also looked into the legality of such short-term rentals after coming under pressure from tenant advocates, who say the proliferation of Airbnb rentals has sapped the rental housing market of supply and driven up rent prices.

A valuation of $10 billion would make Airbnb worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corp, which has a market value of $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide Corp, valued at $9.39 billion.

Harper also issued an economic sanction against Bank Rossiya, a financial institution that serves as the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation following the “so-called” referendum that annexed Crimea from Ukraine.

“Together with our international allies, our government is taking a strong stance in our support for Ukraine. We continue to take additional actions to limit the capabilities of specific individuals and Bank Rossiya, which are responsible for undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty,” he said in a statement.

The Russian officials include Andrei Alexandrovich Fursenko, aide to President of the Russian Federation, Victor Petrovich Ivanov, member of the security council of the Russian Federation, as well as various military and foreign policy advisors.

Harper left for a trip to Ukraine Friday morning to meet with that country’s prime minister and show support for Ukrainians during the Russian incursion into the Crimean peninsula.

The brief trip to Ukraine comes a few days before Harper is expected to make the case for a tough, united G7 front against the Russians.

A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit has being unveiled - and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

But the big question on many people's lips is: What about the supermarket trolleys?

Described as a 'giant leap into the future' the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3per cent in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit' which disappeared in 1971.

Five ways to tell your pound coin is fake

The original pound coin was issued in 1983 to replace the old pound note which was officially withdrawn from circulation in 1988.

Pound for pound: Some cash facts###833||Before a crowd of supporters at a campaign rally on Thursday afternoon in the city of Bursa—about a two-hour ferry ride from Istanbul—Turkey’s Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, vowed to ban Twitter. The threat came in the middle of a particularly fiery speech, even for Erdoğan, who wields a nuclear arsenal of angry declarations and allegations. “We now have a court order,” he said. “We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. They will see the power of the Turkish Republic.”

Just before midnight, as though yielding directly to the force of Erdoğan’s fury, Turkey became one of only two countries in the world to block Twitter entirely. (The other is China.) Four separate court orders prevent Turkish Internet service providers from connecting to Twitter’s servers, making it impossible to access the service.

Twitter has been a target of Erdoğan’s increasing anger since May of 2013, when the social-media platform was used to help organize the anti-government protests that spread from Istanbul’s Gezi Park throughout Turkey. Back then, he called Twitter a “scourge.” Even before Gezi, individuals were occasionally prosecuted for tweets that were considered blasphemous or were found to “incite hatred.” In February, the Azeri journalist Mahir Zeynalov was deported from Turkey for two tweets. When a controversial investigation into government corruption, launched in December, was effectively blocked in the courts, information described as “suppressed evidence” began to be leaked online by opponents of Erdoğan, often using Twitter. One particularly explosive recording purports to feature an anxious conversation between Erdoğan and his son Bilal about hiding millions of dollars from investigators.

A pamphlet called “Everybody Should Know These Facts,” recently distributed throughout Istanbul by Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (A.K.P.), warns readers to beware of false news that is spread on Twitter—where, Erdoğan alleged last month, his government was being assailed by a “robot lobby.” It’s obvious that the Prime Minister views Twitter as a serious threat to his leadership. It’s harder to know why he thinks blocking it is a good move.

This morning, when I reached Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor at Istanbul’s Bilgi University and an expert in cyberlaw, he was at a conference in Ankara on Internet freedom. “Blocking access to Twitter is the worst kind of censorship one can imagine,” he wrote in an e-mail. “Absence of these social media platforms will be seen as a significant democratic deficit in Turkey. Certainly, it casts a dark shadow over Turkey’s democratization process and potential EU membership.” What it does not do, unfortunately for Erdoğan, is prevent people from using Twitter.

According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, fourteen per cent of Turkey’s eighty million people use Twitter—a relatively high figure for a country where only forty-five per cent of the population uses the Internet. Shortly after news outlets reported the ban, articles about how to circumvent it began to circulate widely, and the hashtags #twitterisblockedinturkey and #turkeyblockedtwitter were among Twitter’s trending keywords worldwide. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder, retweeted the company’s advice—in Turkish—about how to post tweets using S.M.S., while other Turks on Twitter sang the praises of their V.P.N. services, which bypass local Internet providers. According to a company that tracks Twitter use in Turkey, more than half a million tweets were posted in the first ten hours after the ban took effect, roughly in line with normal daily activity. Even members of the A.K.P. appeared to breach the ban, including Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç, who announced his campaign schedule on Twitter.

Among ordinary users, anger mixed with mockery. Many people posted a drawing of Erdoğan spraying a black cloud of insecticide at the blue bird that is Twitter’s logo. Another popular illustration turned the white crescent on the Turkish flag into a Pac-Man about to eat the bird. A photo of Erdoğan on the phone has the Prime Minister asking the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, “I’m blocking Twitter. Then what?” Representatives from the European Union and the United States have already condemned the ban, as have human-rights groups—but Erdoğan claims not to care about the international community.

Among Erdoğan’s critics and among journalists in Turkey, the ban only serves to demonstrate how tone-deaf the A.K.P. has become in its zeal for message control. The move against Twitter looks desperate and, given how accessible the service remains, futile—the sort of clumsy measure that authoritarian leaders often take as they witness their power draining away. (The last time I woke up to news of Twitter being blocked was three years ago, in Cairo, when it was ordered by Hosni Mubarak.) But the ban also highlights a disturbing trend in Erdoğan’s attitude toward the opposition, and signals that the authoritarian tendencies that surfaced during last year’s Gezi protests are only growing stronger. Local elections are set to be held in nine days, and the atmosphere is tense.

Yesterday, before the ban went into effect, the journalist and author Mustafa Akyol wrote about the A.K.P.’s reëlection campaign for the news site Al-Monitor. In the article, called “Erdoğan’s Great Patriotic War,” Akyol dissects a campaign video that in grand, dramatic strokes implies that there are forces inside Turkey that are intent on dismantling the nation, and only Erdoğan, along with the unwavering support of Turkish citizens, can stop them. “No words are spoken other than Erdoğan’s excerpt from the national anthem,” Akyol says, “but for all Turks who see it, the message is all too obvious: Erdoğan’s political opponents are not only attacking him, they are attacking the nation itself. Turkish patriots must unite against these most wicked of enemies.”

In February, the Turkish parliament passed a bill, which President Abdullah Gül later signed into law, that gave the government broad control over the Internet, including the ability to block sites without a court order and to collect and retain user histories. When the law was first passed, I interviewed Geoffrey King and Nina Ognianova, of the Committee to Protect Journalists. They were both dismayed by the new law, and, though Twitter was still unblocked, it was already clear that online speech was not entirely free. At that point, China was the only country still blocking Twitter, and neither King nor Ognianova anticipated a complete ban in Turkey—which, after all, still hoped to join the E.U. “Losing a platform like Twitter, even if it’s replaced by another, is a disaster for both regular citizens and professional journalists,” King told me. In a separate conversation, Ognianova was equally direct. “In the past few years, Turkey has gone from a country that’s been considered a regional hope to a country that’s now considered a regional concern,” she said. “That’s characterized by a shrinking space for freedom of expression.”

Video gamers will be able to trade their old games for store credit at Walmart under a program announced Monday by company executives.

Walmart and Sam's Club will start accepting used video games March 26 at 3,100 stores nationwide, and the refurbished games should be available this summer, said Duncan MacNaughton, Walmart's chief merchandising and marketing officer.

The retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., is hoping to attract some of the nation's 110 million gamers, grab a share of the $2 billion used-video-game market and compete with industry leader GameStop for customers.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customers win," MacNaughton said. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

Walmart launched trade-in programs for smartphones and tablet computers last fall, paying customers $50 to $300 for used phones and up to $300 for tablets.

The company experimented with a used-game program in 2009 but was unable to find the right model for its customers and stores, executives said.

Under the new program, gamers can bring in used video games that still work in the original packaging to the electronics department. The games will be checked for any damage and scanned using the bar code.

Customers then will be offered a trade-in value for store credit of up to $35 that can be spent immediately on new video-game consoles, new or used games or any item in Walmart or Sam's Club.

Thousands of video games for popular consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will be accepted.

The trade-in program should help customers to barter games they no longer use for new games or to buy the latest gaming consoles, MacNaughton said.

Walmart spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said there are an estimated 800 million games that are no longer used in gamers' collections.

MacNaughton said Walmart intends to pay more for used videos and sell them for less than its competitors.

GameStop Corp., based in Grapevine, Texas, is one of the largest video-game retailers, with 6,650 stores in 15 countries.

It reported $8.89 billion in revenue for fiscal 2012.

Now on the U.S. blacklist are Kremlin banker Yuri Kovalchuk and his Bank Rossiya, major oil and commodities trader Gennady Timchenko and the brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, linked to big contracts on gas pipelines and at the Sochi Olympics, as well as Putin’s chief of staff and his deputy, the head of military intelligence and a railways chief. Most have deep ties with Putin and have grown rich during his time in power.

The EU has predictably acted more cautiously, adding a further 12 names to the list of Russian and Crimean officials already hit with travel bans and asset freezes, cancelling an EU-Russia summit and starting preparatory work on broader financial and trade sanctions – “stage 3” which Angela Merkel said would be triggered if Putin escalated the crisis any further.

The dozen new names will be published today.

Russia’s retaliatory sanctions so far look thin – banning senior U.S. politicians from travelling there, which was greeted with derision by the likes of John Boehner and John McCain. But there could be more to follow which will hurt Europe, with its deep economic and trade ties with Russia.

The working assumption remains that it would cost Moscow too much to curb or cut off its gas supplies to the EU. It supplies a third of Europe’s gas and more than a fifth of its oil but the EU has hefty reserves after a mild winter.

The other presumption is that while Europe will not go to the wall over Crimea, any Russian intervention in the east of Ukraine would demand a more robust, though not military, response from there and Washington. But no one really knows how Putin will react next.

If any reminder of the cost was needed, Russian stocks have fallen nearly three percent this morning and last night Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook on Russia’s credit rating to negative from stable. It expects further sanctions to be imposed.

Bank Rossiya has said it is working as normal today though Visa and MasterCard have stopped providing payment transactions services for its clients.

The EU plans to sign an “association agreement” with Ukraine today, promising closer political and trade ties that will help draw it more closely into Europe and boost its economic growth. This is another way of hurting Russia.

By luring the rump of Ukraine towards the west and priming it with funds, it could be lost to Russia forever, dealing a fatal blow to Putin’s plan for a Eurasian trading bloc. For Kiev’s part, it may have to adopt an ostensibly neutral stance between east and west to avoid provoking Moscow further.

Brussels is giving Ukraine unfettered access to the 28-nation bloc’s 500 million consumers even before a proposed bilateral free-trade accord comes into force later this year. And it has also brought forward plans to finalise agreements with Moldova and Georgia, signing them by June at the latest.

An IMF team in Kiev has extended its work on an aid package until Tuesday, saying good progress had been made.

The U.S. and EU would row in behind an IMF package, helping Ukraine meet its debt obligations and begin the process of rebuilding. A meeting of G7 leaders in the Hague on Monday could be pivotal in that regard.

EU minds have also been focused on reducing their dependence on Russian energy which would eventually leave Moscow nowhere to look but east. Longer-term, that means boosting “indigenous supplies”, which include renewable energy and shale gas, exploring how much U.S. gas could be shipped to Europe and before that looking to the Gulf for LNG.

EU sources said the leaders agreed to accelerate work to upgrade cross-border energy networks to reduce individual member states’ vulnerability to supply cuts, and speed up building new liquefied natural gas import terminals to diversify suppliers.

Elsewhere, Rome is poised to announce a new issue of its popular BTP Italia bond. The retail bond aimed at ordinary Italians set a

European record by raising 22.3 billion euros at the last sale in November. It has also attracted institutional buyers.

S&P has affirmed Greece’s rating at B-, deep in junk territory, with a stable outlook, saying its economy is gradually rebalancing. It said it could raise the rating if growth were to pick up more substantially. The agency is also due to run the rule over Nigeria.###840||{ }

MOSCOW (AP) - Russian stocks were under pressure Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered economic sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin's entourage.

Fears over Russia's economic outlook have ratcheted up this week as the country annexed Crimea following Sunday's hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate and has slapped on sanctions in response.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin's inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin's chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin's lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury's sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia's 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a "personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation."

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that their bank cards are not as useful as they were. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services "without prior notification." SMP's co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg - billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin - were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia's top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard's actions as "illegitimate" because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won't be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank's. They can also get cash directly inside their banks' branches.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country's central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to "take the bank's clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them."

Describing Rossiya, which was rumored to serve nearly everyone in Putin's close entourage, as "just an average bank," Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one "first thing on Monday" and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia's central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. "does not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability."

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor's in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia's debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia's economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia's BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country's borrowing costs more expensive.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov lambasted the move, saying it was not an objective decision and that somebody "ordered" it.

"Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support," Fitch said.

Boeing's design and manufacture of its cutting-edge 787 jetliner is safe despite the many problems encountered since the plane's rollout, according to a report issued jointly Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration and the aircraft maker.

JPMorgan said Wednesday it is selling its physical commodities business for $3.5 billion, after new regulations crimped its ability to control power plants, warehouses and oil refineries.

If approved by regulators, the deal would put the commodities business in the hands of energy and commodities trading company Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.

Big banks have long profited from price swings in metals, energy and other commodities. But some had branched out into owning physical facilities as well. Last summer, JPMorgan said the possibility of new regulations on whether banks could continue to do that was a factor in its decision to sell some of its physical commodities business.

FedEx Corp. said its latest quarterly profit rose 5 percent from a year ago, despite storms that raised the company's costs.

The company's ground-shipping segment is doing better, but the express-delivery business is flat and customers continue to shift to slower, cheaper services for international shipments.

The quarter's results were below analysts' expectations. The weak quarter drove FedEx to lower its profit forecast for the year.

The splashy move comes as Starbucks Corp. looks to tap into tea as a new sales driver. Starbucks cafes are still enjoying strong sales growth, but the company is also facing intensifying competition as fast-food chains and others crowd the coffee market.

At the top of the list are chief executives from both new and old economy companies. Alan Mulally of Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), widely lauded for turning around the company, ranked second. Ford was the only one of the Big Three automakers that did not file for Chapter 11 during the recession, and as such did not take any federal bailout money.

Third on the list is Richard W. Edelman, who runs the PR firm founder by his father.

Fourth on the list is Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM), a major provider of technology for smartphones. He is now the company’s executive chairman, having given up the CEO role to one of the firm’s veterans, Steve Mollenkopf. Jacobs’ father founded the firm.

Fifth on the list is Craig Jelinek of brick-and-mortar retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST), often cited as one of America’s best run retailers. He is followed by Brad Smith of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS).

The final three of the top 10 are Howard D. Schultz of Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX), another brick-and-mortar company; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), which is now one of the largest public corporations based on market cap, despite its modest revenue; and Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) CEO Larry Page. Page and Zuckerberg are also founders.

The extent to which old economy companies have a major presence on the list is because included among the top 50 are Edward C. “Ned” Johnson III of Fidelity, another family controlled firm; Mickey Drexler of brick-and-mortar retailer J. Crew; Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX); Bob Iger of Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS); and Blake W. Nordstrom, part of the founding family of brick-and-mortar retailer Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN).

Among new economy CEOs, Tim Cook of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) made the list, as did Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO).

Retail CEOs dominated much of the list, a surprise because these companies often are ranked low in customer service polls. Their employees must believe otherwise. Hubert Joly of troubled electronics retailer Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) is on the list, as is Frank Blake of Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD), Glenn K. Murphy of Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) and Ed Crenshaw of Publix.###844||Citi Bike, hard-up for cash, shouldn’t expect any help from Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The new mayor told reporters today that the city’s bike-share program, reportedly bleeding money, will probably not be getting any public dollars to help fill its coffers.

“At this moment, that’s not in our plans,” said Mr. de Blasio, responding to a question about whether the city would aid the privately-financed program at an unrelated press conference today. “We want to see what we can do help them back on their feet using other methodologies.”

Despite their popularity in some neighborhoods and their ballyhooed–if delayed–roll-out under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Citi Bike continues to lose money, according to today’s Wall Street Journal. The report cited poor weather, rising operational costs, damage to equipment during Hurricane Sandy and unexpectedly low usage by tourists as reasons for the bike share’s financial struggles.

Unlike bike-share programs in other cities, Citi Bike receives no public money. All revenue is raised through membership fees, corporate sponsorships and advertising. Polly Trottenberg, the city’s new transportation commissioner, has left the door open to a possible price hike, but is in discussions with the company about other options.

“What Commissioner Trottenberg was doing is sitting down with the folks from Citi Bike and saying, ‘What would help in terms of the way things are structured now, what would help you financially, with all the other possibilities that may be there?” Mr. de Blasio said. “We’re open to any proposal they have. Again, at this moment, city budget money is not on the table but we’re open to other alternatives.”

The mayor, when pressed, further said he would be open to state or federal funding to keep the bikes running.

“If we can find that, that certainly would be great,” he said. “But the point is I think it’s a valuable service, it’s proven to be a success, we want to see it continue, we want to see it expand and we’re going to work with them to find alternatives.”###845||Economic expectations for Germany worsened in March, burdened by the Crimea crisis, while the assessment of current situation hit the highest level since 2011, survey data from the Centre for European Economic Research/ZEW revealed Tuesday.

The economic confidence index dropped more-than-expected to 46.6 in March from 55.7 in February. The March score was the weakest since August 2013. It was forecast to fall less markedly to 52.

"In this month's survey the Crimea Crisis is weighing on experts' economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW President Clemens Fuest.

"Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk."

Meanwhile, the measure of experts' assessment of the current economic situation improved to 51.3 points, the highest since August 2011, from 50 in February. The assessment strengthened for the fourth month in a row, but stayed below the expected level of 52.

The economic expectations index for the Eurozone declined by 7 points to 61.5 threshold. By contrast, the indicator for the current economic situation gained 3.5 points to minus 36.7 points in March.

Although the current political relationship with Russia might have limited impact on the German , the possible upcoming measures will put the German recovery to a serious test, ING Bank NV Economist Carsten Brzeski said.

The largest Eurozone economy grew 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter and the government expects it to expand 1.8 percent this year.

The European Commission raised the country's growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent and the projection for 2015 was lifted to 2 percent from 1.9 percent.

If you are looking at taking a home loan, understanding the movements of interest rates is even more critical, since you would want to decide whether to take the loan at fixed rate of interest or floating. Hybrid home loan takes away this problem. Opting for a pure fixed or a pure floating loan lands you in a situation of losing out on the benefits of the other loan. Here, hybrid loans enable you to enjoy the best of both worlds. (Also read: Home loan checklist)

What are hybrid loans?

With competition increasing with each passing day, banks and financing agencies tend to innovate products that suit and attract you. Hybrid loans are loan options where you get a mix of fixed and floating types of loans, combined into one. It is a contrast to what already existed-the fixed and floating interest rate loans. In other words, hybrid loans are combination loans, which are partly fixed and partly floating. Such loans are preferable since you do not have an idea about the future of interest rates.

Is it suitable for you?

Under this scheme, banks offer you a fixed interest rate for a certain period of time like 3-5 years, while the rest of the outstanding amount would carry a floating rate of interest. Such loans are beneficial for those who cannot afford volatility in expenses in initial few years of your financial life or careers and anticipate an increase in your ability to manage volatility before the loan begins adjusting. Such loans are typically suited to those who have a shorter credit history and a smaller power to face volatility. After the third year, you will be charged slightly higher floating interest rates. However, if you get a fixed rate loan in the beginning, you would be able to manage your financial life better. Keeping interests rates low and fixed initially will help you save more for your future and changing interest rates will help you save thereafter.

The process

When you opt for such loans, your bank might ask you to sign two separate loan agreements-one for fixed rate of interest and the other for floating rate of interest. However, many banks may combine the same and use a single agreement for both the components. You must read the terms and conditions of your agreements with utmost care and your relationship manager is bound to explain to you, if you do not understand them.

Under Hybrid loans, many banks offer you the option of foreclosing the floating component if the interest rates move up, with or without any pre-payment fees. And if the interest rates move down, may foreclose the fixed part, with or without pre-payment penalty, as per banks policies. Other banks offer you facilities such as converting your fixed portion to floating if the interest rates move down and converting the floating rates into fixed, if interest rates move up. Of course you will be charged a certain amount of fees for doing so, which can more often than not, be negotiated.

Some examples of hybrid loans include State Bank of India's offer of SBI-Flexi Home Loans, HDFC's 2-in-1 Home, Part Fixed,-Part Floating loan by ICICI and Bank of Baroda's Flexi-home loans.

For example, if you opt for a loan of Rs 20 lakh and are not sure about the movement of interest rates, you have the option of choosing to take 60 percent of Rs 20 lakh as a fixed rate home loan and remaining Rs 8 lakh at a floating rate of interest. Choosing this proportion is open to you and is based on how much risk you can afford to take and depends on your understanding of the interest rate market.

Your risk appetite would be high if you go for a higher floating component in a scenario where interest rates are likely to go upwards and vice versa.

Opting for hybrid loans is a good idea for those who keep a track of changing interest rates regularly. Otherwise, they just might be more than tricky for you. Because the initial teaser rates may be loan enough to beat competition, if you do not pay in time and keep a track of movement of interest rates, your EMI or equated monthly instalment may just shot up later. These problems blow up to a large extent in times of weak economy. Individuals who expect raises and promotions to factor in the higher EMIs they would have to pay in future have tough time when hopes do not realize.

Things to note

The two very important factors that you need to consider while analyzing floating rates would be the margin and the cap that would be applicable to you. If both these numbers are fairly low, there is nothing like going out and opting for a hybrid loan now, if the fixed rate suits your current repayment ability.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###848||Empty###849||NEW YORK (AP) ��Sally�Beauty says that a security breach discovered on March 5 affected fewer than 25,000 credit and debit card accounts.

NEW YORK (AP) ��Sally�Beauty says that a security breach discovered on March 5 affected fewer than 25,000 credit and debit card accounts.

The seller of beauty supplies is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm. It is also working with the U.S. Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter.

Sally�Beauty Holdings Inc., which is based in Denton, Texas, said Monday that it will provide more information on its website in coming days, including notification of affected consumers and others.

A spate of major data breaches in recent months has raised awareness about the vulnerability of cards used in the U.S.

Recent intrusions include those at Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus. The Target breach compromised 40 million credit and debit cards and personal information of up to 70 million customers. At Neiman Marcus, its breach may have compromised 1.1 million debit and credit cards.

Security experts have been long pushed for increased consumer protection through so-called EMV enabled credit and debit cards, which are already common in Europe. Most cards in the U.S. still feature magnetic strips.

Earlier this month Visa and MasterCard, which seek broader acceptance of EMV technology from retailers and ATMs, said that they are creating a group intended to help the retail and banking industries come together on more-secure credit card payments. Visa and MasterCard, which run the networks that carry the payments, said the group's initial focus will be on chips embedded in newer credit cards that make them more secure.

NEW YORK—Security software maker Symantec says it fired president and CEO Steve Bennett and named director Michael Brown as his temporary replacement.

Bennett has been president and CEO of the company since July 2012. Symantec said that he resigned from the board of directors after his termination. He was also chairman of the company until Symantec split the chairman and CEO roles in January 2013.

The Mountain View, Calif., company did not cite a precise reason for Bennett’s ouster.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” Symantec Chairman Dan Schulman said in a press release.

Brown has been with the company since July 2005. He is the former chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.###851||Sorry, this zipcode is not in our deliverable area for this subscription service.

The outfit turned up 200,000 coins in an old digital wallet that was thought to be empty, said CEO Mark Karpeles in a statement (PDF). 200,000 coins are worth over $100m.

"MtGox Co., Ltd. had certain old format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins," it said in the statement, explaining that the coins were uncovered earlier this month in a file that had not been used since mid 2011.

Karpeles said that the discovery puts 200,000 Bitcoins in Mt Gox's hands, but added that still means 650,000 Bitcoins have been lost or stolen. It is possible that Mt Gox has overestimated its losses.

"Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC." Karpeles explained.

"Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of Bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation."

This month the exchange won bankruptcy protection in the US and a stay of any lawsuits against it. This prompted suggestions that the US bankruptcy court was letting the fox guard the hen house.

The line from the firm is that it is not at fault and is the victim of theft or a bug. Now it should probably add that it is a bit forgetful as well.

"At the start of February 2014, illegal access through the abuse of a bug in the Bitcoin system resulted in an increase in incomplete Bitcoin transfer transactions and we discovered that there was a possibility that Bitcoins had been illicitly moved through the abuse of this bug," Karpeles said earlier.

"As a result of our internal investigation, we found that a large amount of Bitcoins had disappeared. Although the complete extent is not yet known, we found that approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and approximately 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to us had disappeared." µ###853||Walmart will soon let consumers trade in their old video games for gift cards that they can then use to shop for items in its stores or on walmart.com.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Walmart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Walmart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Walmart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Walmart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Walmart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States.

“We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Walmart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and ipad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” said Mac Naughton.

Health insurance premiums have risen more after Obamacare than the average premium increases over the eight years before it became law, according to the private health exchange eHealthInsurance.

The individual market for health insurance has seen premiums rise by 39 percent since February 2013, eHealth reports. Without a subsidy, the average individual premium is now $274 a month. Families have been hit even harder with an average increase of 56 percent over the same period — average premiums are now $663 per family, over $426 last year.

Between 2005 and 2013, average premiums for individual plans increased 37 percent and average family premiums were upped 31 percent. So they have risen faster under Obamacare than in the previous eight years.

An important caveat is that eHealth’s prices don’t include subsidies, so the prices for anyone earning between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level will be lower. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has repeatedly claimed patients will pay as little as $18 per month, without noting the taxpayer cost.

Premiums are being hiked across the board for several reasons, but the biggest contributor is the Obama administration’s highly touted “essential health benefits,” services that insurers on and off exchanges must provide.

Some benefits, such as emergency and laboratory services, are uncontroversial. But others, like maternity, newborn and pediatric services, are causing headaches for huge swaths of the population that don’t need them. Anyone past childbearing age, single men, the infertile, even nuns — their premiums are rising as well, because their plans must, by law, provide more services.

But premiums aren’t the only key to health care costs — deductibles and out-of-pocket costs like co-pays are also rising. When it comes to employer health plans alone, four out of five U.S. companies have increased deductibles or are considering doing so.

Prices may be people away from purchasing health insurance. The latest survey from consulting firm McKinsey found that half of those who haven’t purchased health insurance yet this year cited their inability to pay the premium.

And it is hard to look at the pictures, ubiquitous this morning, without a disgracefully touchy-feely, yes, I fear, even protectively feminine response. Isn't it sweet? Doesn't it have something perfectly reflective of our quirky national identity that the present pound coin roundly lacks?

Resurrecting the shape of the old threepenny bit is a stroke of genius. Note the universally positive reaction. Note, too, how uniformly well-schooled the broadcasters were in pronouncing it "thrupenny" as of old. The PR pack must have come with a pronunciation guide.

Hold on a moment, though. Is it not budget day? Why on earth launch a showy new pound coin with so much fanfare, when the real news is supposed to be the UK's superb growth projections, absurdly generous new subsidies for childcare and a thoroughly welcome rise in the income tax threshold, courtesy of Nick Clegg?

Seen in this light, the new threepenny-style pound coin looks suspiciously like a diversion. What giant new claim on our fast-depleting personal wealth is the chancellor going to spring on us that requires such an elaborate ploy? There's something disconcertingly April-foolish about it.

The official reason for introducing a new pound coin now is the estimated 45 million or so counterfeit ones that are in circulation. The old pound coin, as we must soon call it, was too simple to reproduce; a dodecagon represents a whole new challenge. Some, though, detect a different intention. The old pound, they suggest, looked too much like a euro coin for today's Eurosceptic sensibility. Nice timing, of course, in the run-up to EU parliamentary elections: Nigel Farage marshals his Ukip troops beneath his banner of limiting EU migration, while the Conservatives open their campaign meetings by flipping their new nationalist coin.

In another adroit piece of PR, there's to be a competition for the design of the non-Queen side. Public engagement is always a good idea. The one symbol likely to be ruled out, I imagine, is the thistle. Just in case.

Yet all enthusiasm for the new pound has tended to obscure some practical points. While the Royal Mint assures us that replacing one coin with another is not as expensive as we might think, this may be because much of the additional bill – £45m as someone estimated on Radio 4's Today programme (which eerily recalls the number of counterfeit pounds thought to be in circulation) – will, it seems, be paid by business, and by us.

A significant extra cost will be the replacement, or adaptation, of everything that requires pound coins at present. From luggage trolleys at airport and stations, to machines at the laundrette, to supermarket trolleys and slot machines providing everything from fizzy drinks to condoms. You also have to wonder how smoothly a 12-sided coin will be able to slip down its slot. One solution might be for the government to accelerate the withdrawal of the old coins as legal tender and have them sold back to us as tokens.

There is, though, a possible benefit from this change. Feeding pound coins into those super-fast gambling machines might seem more like spending real money than it does at present, and the new coins might periodically get stuck. Could it be that this has already been factored into the equation? As well as getting a patriotic rush from our new pound, we are to be saved from ourselves by other, stealthier, means.###858||Empty###859||Revised federal data released Monday suggests New Jersey's unemployment rate declined more gradually last year than previously reported.

Justin Sullivan, Getty Images

The report using numbers collected by the federal government was issued by the state Labor Department. It also shows the state's unemployment rate for January was 7.1 percent, the lowest it has been since December 2008.

Monthly reports showed the state's unemployment rate declining by more than 1 percentage point from October to December, as people stopped looking for work. Those figures raised questions at the time, as they showed residents quickly getting out of the workforce a year after the number of residents looking for work had abruptly spiked. The new figures suggest the number of job-seekers has changed more slowly.

The annual benchmarking of the data shows the unemployment rate decline was less dramatic, as the rate consistently dropped by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point each month throughout 2013.

The revised numbers show more job growth in the state last year than reported in the monthly updates. But there were more than twice as many private-sector jobs created in 2012 as the 19,000 added in 2013.

The benchmarked figures have made the state's unemployment picture look less dramatic in the past, too. Last year's revision showed unemployment peaked in 2012 at 9.6 percent, not 9.9 percent contained in the monthly report at the time.

The monthly report for January that was released Monday along with the revised 2013 data showed the year was off to a slow start as there were 10,500 fewer jobs and 17,000 fewer residents in the labor market.

Bank Rossiya, the Russian bank best known for its close ties to top Kremlin figures, is to be "frozen out of the dollar", according to US officials, as part of the new wave of sanctions from Washington.

Shortly after Barack Obama signed off the measures on Thursday it emerged that rating agency Standard & Poors had warned on the outlook for the Russian economy amid escalating tensions over Ukraine.

"Heightened geopolitical risk and the prospect of US and EU economic sanctions following Russia's incorporation of Crimea could reduce the flow of potential investment, trigger rising capital outflows, and further weaken Russia's already deteriorating economic performance," S&P analysts said.

The remarks were made in anticipation of EU and US sanctions, but before the announcement of actions from the US Treasury Department, targeting 20 more Russian citizens and the nation's 17th largest bank with US asset freezes.

"This is not our preferred outcome. These sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy. However, Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community," Obama said.

US officials said the St Petersburg lender was "the personal bank" for more than a dozen Russian government officials and powerful business leaders deemed to be members of Vladimir Putin's inner circle.

Those identified as allegedly doing the Russian president's bidding included the bank's billionaire chairman and largest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk. They claim he acts as "personal banker for Putin", noting he has been referred to as one of the Russian president's "cashiers".

Kovalchuk reputedly forged close ties to Vladimir Putin throughout the 1990s, when Russia's president served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg. The two men still have luxury dachas near each another on Komsomolskoye lake, outside the city.

Kovalchuk is part of a dacha cooperative with other members of this upmarket lakeside community, with several other members also major shareholders in Bank Rossiya.

The bank boss, now estimated by Forbes to have a personal fortune of $1.4bn according to Forbes, helped transform the bank from a Communist party-backed enterprise into a fast-growing and, above all, well-connected bank.

As well as leading the boardroom, Kovalchuk is the largest shareholder in Bank Rossiya, owning close to 30%. Outside banking, he also has interests in a number of federal television channels and a mobile network, Tele2.

The bank has assets of about $10bn and, after its 2010 takeover of Gazenergoprombank, almost doubled in size, breaking into the top 20 of Russian lenders.

Its operations are concentrated in the north-west of Russia and around Moscow, where it is active in a wide range of saving and loan operations, with clients in oil, gas and energy. Bank Rossiya controls large insurance groups Sogas and SK Transneft.

The bank has been well known for its substantial dealings with Russian gas group Gazprom. Banking analysts at Fitch Ratings have noted in the past that Bank Rossiya relied heavily on a tiny handful of customers for about 60% of its funding, some of whom also act as customers and shareholders of the bank.

According to US Treasury officials Bank Rossiya "is the personal bank for senior officials in the Russian Federation" and Kovalchuk "is also the personal banker for senior officials ... including Putin".

In their report, S&P analysts said: "In our view, there is a material risk that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could extend beyond Crimea and that violence between pro- and anti-Russian protesters could spread to other cities in Eastern Ukraine." The analysts suggested sanctions imposed by EU countries may be tempered as political leaders looked to their economic, trade and energy interests.

Initial market reactions to the Ukraine crisis have suggested investors were quick to discount fears that the dispute would have a major impact on global trade, but the fresh analysis from S&P and a second round of sanctions from Washington may prompt some to revise that view.

One US official in Washington told Reuters: "Sanctions build over time. They are very powerful. And people may think that they are a mere wrist slap. I can assure them that they are not."###865||Empty###866||This typically happens in big cable system mergers, but still adds to the pressure on Comcast to make public interest concessions to win approval for its $45.2B acquisition of Time Warner Cable.

In a similar report on Wednesday, the US business daily Wall Street Journal also said a settlement to this amount was discussed, but according to unnamed sources was still likely to fall apart.

A spokeswoman for Toyota told CNN that the Japanese carmaker had cooperated with the US Attorney's Office in this matter for four years.

"During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements," the spokeswoman said. Both CNN and Wall Street Journal said the US Justice Department was not available for comment.

In 2009, Toyota started a series of massive recalls involving more than 10 million cars, mostly in the United States. The problems involved faulty brakes, gas pedals and floor mats that had led to unintended acceleration of its cars.

Just recently, the Justice Department has started a probe into whether US automaker General Motors was slow in recalling cars with a defect linked to 13 deaths.

The Obama administration has taken a red pen to its signature health care reform law again — rewriting the measure without consulting Congress.

This time, the White House wants to extend Obamacare’s “risk corridors,” which require the feds to bail out insurance companies if they lose too much money in the law’s exchanges.

Taxpayers can’t afford billions more in unchecked corporate liabilities. Rather than stroke checks to insurers to make up for the huge sums they’ll lose by participating in Obamacare’s exchanges, Congress should scrap the law altogether.

Here’s how the risk corridors work. If an insurer has to pay claims that are 3 percent more than projected, the government must reimburse the insurer for half the excess payments. If claims are 8 percent or more beyond projections, the government reimburses about 75 percent of the losses.

If costs are lower than projected, insurers are supposed to pay the government. Because estimates of Obamacare’s cost have marched steadily upward since the law passed, though, that outcome seems unlikely. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that Obamacare will cost more than $2 trillion through 2024 — more than double its initial projection.

Without the promise of a bailout, many insurers would have been reluctant to sell through the exchanges, due to the high probability of “adverse selection.” That’s the insurance-industry term for having too many old and sick customers — and not enough young and healthy ones.

If that happens, then the insurance risk pools become imbalanced. Insurers end up paying out more in claims than they receive in premiums. If the “selection” is “adverse” enough, the whole system collapses.

Insurers’ fears are increasingly looking justified.

Many Americans have had trouble enrolling because of technical problems with both federal and state exchange websites.

Meanwhile, the president has declared that the approximately 5 million Americans whose policies were cancelled because of Obamacare won’t have to pay tax penalties in 2014 designed to force them into the exchanges. The special dispensation was granted after a public outcry about the president’s promise that Americans would be able to keep their existing coverage under his health reform plan.

Younger Americans are realizing that they’re going to pay higher premiums to subsidize coverage for older Americans, even though the latter group is, on average, wealthier. For millions of young adults, remaining uninsured — whereby they can pay the individual mandate penalty of $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is greater, starting April 1 — will be cheaper than getting covered. So they’re staying away from the marketplaces.

A December Kaiser Family Foundation report described a 25 percent enrollment rate among 18-34 year olds as a “worst-case scenario” that could cost insurers more than half their profit margin.

That worst-case scenario is now reality. Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Avik Roy notes that “25 percent of non-elderly adults who selected an exchange plan were younger than 35,” according to January data.

Obamacare’s supporters say that they envisioned these hiccups. Indeed, the law plainly states that Obamacare “shall establish and administer a program of risk corridors for calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016” to help the exchanges outlast any growing pains.

We’re just two months into their first year, though, and the White House is already talking about extending them three more years. That means the Obama administration expects the exchanges to be financially unsustainable for at least six years after their launch.

How long are Americans supposed to wait before Obamacare starts working?

Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, isn’t willing to wait any longer. He’s looking to repeal the risk corridors. “The American people are sick of Washington picking winners and losers, especially since the chosen losers often end up being taxpayers who foot the bills for Washington’s mistakes,” said Mr. Rubio. “Eliminating Obamacare’s blank check for a bailout of insurance companies is a common-sense step to protect taxpayers when Obamacare fails.”

Obamacare is already set to cost taxpayers more than $2 trillion over the next decade. Funneling federal money to insurers through 2019 to get them to play ball on the exchanges — as the administration appears to want to do — will drive that price tag even higher. Congress should put a stop to this ill-advised bailout.

By Andy Malt | Published on Wednesday 19 March 2014

US streaming platform Pandora has announced that it will increase the price of its ad-free premium service, blaming those pesky royalties it has to pay to music companies for the hike. From May, new Pandora One customers will pay $4.99 per month, though existing subscribers will continue to pay $3.99 for the time being.

A post on the Pandora blog sates: “We’ve been fortunate to be able to offer Pandora One at an affordable price since its debut in 2009 at $36 per year and later with the introduction of a monthly subscription for only $3.99 per month. Over this same period, the costs of delivering this service have grown considerably. For example, the royalty rates Pandora pays to performers via SoundExchange for subscription listening have increased 53% in the last five years and will increase another 9% in 2015”.

As previously reported, in addition to the royalties Pandora pays the labels via SoundExchange, it has also been quibbling the monies it hands over to the music publishers via their collecting societies.

Last week Pandora won a court ruling in a dispute with one of those societies, ASCAP, which said it should pay 1.85% of annual revenue (Pandora wanted 1.7%) for the publishing rights, rather than the 3% the collecting society was asking for. Though the big music publishers are continuing to lobby for changes in US collective licensing rules, which would allow them to withdraw their digital rights from ASCAP and its counterpart BMI and negotiate direct with services like Pandora.

Elsewhere, Pandora’s Chief Technology Officer and EVP Of Product Tom Conrad is to step down in June, taking on a part time advisory role from July.

Announcing his departure, Graham said in a letter to Pandora staff: “Through all these years perhaps the most gratifying thing has been how the whole company has evolved. From the scrappy group that wrote those first lines of code to the dynamic and talented assemblage we have today, through it all we’ve benefitted from a group of men and woman that are without question the most talented, intelligent, thoughtful and hardworking team I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with”.

Former VP Of Engineering Chris Martin will replace Graham as Chief Technology Officer, while the company is also seeking to hire a Chief Product Officer externally. It has also bee announced that VP Of Technical Operations Steve Ginsberg is being promoted this week, moving into the role of Chief Information Officer.

"In addition, we are today sanctioning a number of other individuals with substantial resources and influence who provide material support to the Russian leadership, as well as a bank that provides material support to these individuals."The administration also vowed that further punitive steps are on the way.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned that "the question at this point is not if we will do more sanctions, it’s when."Those hit with sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the influential head of Russian Railways, oil trader Gennady Timchenko, and Putin’s chief of staff and close associate, Sergei Ivanov, as well as a handful of others.The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned Bank Rossiya -- among the country's 20 largest banks -- which it called “the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”Its chairman, Yury Kovalchuk, was also placed on the sanctions list.A senior U.S. administration official told reporters in a call that the named individuals “will be unable to access any U.S. financial services, will find it difficult to transact in the dollar, and I suspect will find it very difficult to transact in Europe and elsewhere, as our partners around the world have demonstrated over time a willingness to also adhere to the sanctions that we are imposing."Russian officials included in an initial round of U.S. sanctions on March 17 scoffed at that move, saying they had neither any assets in the United States nor any desire to visit the country.But another senior U.S. official who spoke to journalists by phone after this latest round insisted that the sanctions have teeth.“People may think that they are a mere wrist slap. I can assure them that they are not,” the official said.Legal experts said the fresh sanctions could create havoc for the designated individuals as they try to conduct business, particularly when trying to move money around the world.Douglas McNabb, a Washington-based lawyer specializing in financial sanctions and extradition law, said that "even some banks that don’t have corresponding relations with the U.S. still won’t have anything to do with individuals who have been designated.”One of the targeted individuals, Timchenko, is a Soviet-born Finnish citizen who until this week was a co-owner of the oil-trading company Gunvor, which has a head office in Geneva and a registered office in Cyprus.Gunvor issuedsoon after the announcement saying that in anticipation of "potential economic sanctions," Timchenko on March 19 sold all of his shares in the company to his partner, Swedish businessman Torbjorn Törnqvist.Last year, Reuters reported that Timchenko had hired Washington lobbyists in a bid to secure funding backed by the U.S. government for a luxury aircraft business.Though quickly denied by officials at Gunvor, theon Thursday asserted that "Putin has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor funds."Meanwhile, Bank Rossiya, with about $10 billion in assets, will be effectively shut out of U.S. dollar activities worldwide and have its correspondent relationships with banks across the globe placed under threat, according to Steve Ganis, an expert on financial sanctions with the Boston law firm Mintz Levin.Obama also announced an executive order signed that enables the U.S. government to introduce sanctions on entire sectors of the Russian economy. A senior administration official said that could include the energy, engineering, financial services, or metals and mining sectors.“Once those sectors are designated...we will then be able to impose sanctions on specific entities within those sectors,” the official said. “This is a flexible tool that we can use in response to further provocations” -- the official said, citing potential Russian incursions into other areas of Ukraine.Boston lawyer Ganis said that sanctions on the Russian energy sector could be “quite disruptive” to Russian energy companies but that such sanctions could also affect global markets and create problems for European countries dependent on Russian energy.A U.S. administration official said Washington is "working actively to prepare additional sanctions under these authorities using their creative breadth to design sanctions that will hurt the entities with...the smallest possible impact on us and our allies."Obama’s is traveling next week to Europe, where he said he will discuss the Ukrainian situation with the United States' Group of Seven (G7) partners.###876||Global outcry over Turkey’s Twitter ban

ISTANBUL

Global organizations and the international media have reacted strongly to Turkey’s decision to block Twitter. Here are some of the reactions:“Efforts to shut down Twitter in order to control the news are not only ultimately futile – they sadly move Turkey away from the embrace of human rights and the rule of law, and closer to autocracy. It’s been said that censorship is the lobby of dictatorship. What’s the point of democracy if you won’t give voters the possibility of making an informed decision?”"We call on Prime Minister [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan to stop his vitriol against social media in the country and focus on ensuring that all information platforms are free to function freely in advance of local elections. Turkish authorities must stop viewing the media as the enemy and embrace the role of a free press in a democratic society."“This is another fundamental blow to freedom of expression in Turkey and the right to access information, and the closure order should be immediately lifted. The move further signals that the Turkish government has taken an anti-democratic turn which significantly sets back its human rights record.”“Erdoğan had faced perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office when unidentified critics began using Twitter and YouTube to leak dozens of phone calls and documents that seemed to tie government officials and business circles close to the government to a graft inquiry that began last December. One of the recordings purports to be of the prime minister himself telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of Dec. 17, 2013, when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr. Erdoğan has repeatedly — and angrily — insisted that the recording was fake.”“Erdoğan’s showdown with Twitter has been long coming. In mid-2013, thousands of protests ripped across Turkey ostensibly in opposition to a proposed urban development of Istanbul’s Taksim Gezi Park. But many say that discontent was more rooted in the government’s shift away from secularism – Erdoğan is Muslim — and its recent crackdown on freedom of press and expression.”“Twitter use breaks new record in country as Turks defy purge of social media platform by Ankara.”“Erdoğan says he doesn’t care what the international community will say about the blocking of Twitter.“Wiretapped recordings incriminating Erdoğan have been leaking online for the past few weeks. Now Erdoğan reacts. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government criticized Turkey saying the ban did not fit with Germany’s view of freedom of expression. ‘What we are hearing from Turkey does not comply with what we in Germany understand as free communication,’ said Mrs. Merkel’s spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz.”“This is an attack on the freedom of thought. Only dictators could dare it.”“Turkey blocks Twitter, is Russia next? Twitter had agreed to cooperate with Russian courts, so, a possible blockage in Russia would be softer than in Turkey.”“Erdoğan is doing it to prove his power.”“Turkey PM blocks Twitter after it became awash with evidence of government ‘corruption’ ahead of elections...but his President tweets on!”###877||Empty###878||Empty###879||Empty###880||Empty###881||Investing.com -

Investing.com - The euro fell to fresh session lows against the dollar on Tuesday amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, following reports that armed gunmen stormed a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol.

EUR/USD hit session lows of 1.3880 and was last down 0.24% to 1.3888.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3850 and resistance at 1.3941, the session high.

The euro extended losses after CNN reported that Vladislav Seleznyov, Ukraine's defense ministry spokesman said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The comments came during a speech to a joint session of parliament in Moscow, a day after the president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

The euro slipped against the dollar earlier Tuesday after a report showed that German economic expectations deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February's reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.

In the U.S., data on Tuesday showed that the annual rate of inflation in the U.S. slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%.

U.S. consumer prices edged up 0.1% in February from a month earlier, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

But U.S. housing starts slipped 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

The euro fell to session lows against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.56% to 140.85.

Elsewhere, the dollar was trading close to session lows against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.32% to 101.42, holding above last Friday's trough of 101.19.###882||LOS ANGELES (CBS/AP) — The “Every Day Low Price” king is trying to shake up the world of pricing once again.

Walmart has rolled out an online tool that compares its prices on 80,000 food and household products — from canned beans to dishwashing soap — with those of its competitors. If a lower price is found elsewhere, the discounter will refund the difference to shoppers in the form of store credit.

The world’s largest retailer began offering the feature, called “Savings Catcher,” on its website late last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta. The tool compares advertised prices at retailers with physical stores, and not at online rivals like Amazon.com that also offer low prices on staples.

“You can think of the app as a post-purchase ad match. We are really making it easy in that you don’t have to look through those circulars anymore, you don’t have to know what’s on sale at another retailer,” Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said.

Asked why Walmart doesn’t just implement the lowest price right away, Blakeman said, “This tool is in place for the chance that there is a lower advertised price out there.”

Here’s how the tool works: A customer has to set up an account on http://www.walmart.com, log onto the Savings Catcher page and type in the number on their receipt.

Savings Catcher compares prices of every item on the receipt to a database of advertised prices of competitors that’s provided by an undisclosed third party. The tool doesn’t apply to general merchandise like clothing or electronic gadgets.

Walmart prices are matched to stores based on geographic location. For example, in Atlanta, Walmart compares prices to nearly 20 rivals, including Aldi, CVS, Food Lion, Target and Dollar General.

Any difference in prices is put on a Walmart online gift card. Customers can accumulate savings or use the credit immediately. They can redeem in stores or online by printing out the gift card receipt.

Cal State San Bernardino Marketing Professor Victoria Seitz warned consumers there’s a price to be paid for using an app like this.

“That price is your privacy. They’re going to know about your shopping habits,” she said.

Ken Perkins, president of retail research firm Retail Metrics LLC, said the move will “put pressure on everyone else to follow suit.” But he and other industry watchers voiced concerns that the tool doesn’t compare prices of online retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart said it wants to see how competitors and customers respond to the program, but it doesn’t have any plans to add online stores to the test.

The site went black in Turkey late on Thursday, after Erdogan said in a speech that he intended to "wipe out" the service.

Twitter, a brief, 140-character format well suited to sharing links to information elsewhere online, had become a popular vehicle to spread audio recordings that appeared to incriminate Erdogan and other top government officials in corruption cases.

"A complete ban on social media platforms cannot be approved," President Abdullah Gul, a former ally of Erdogan who has become increasingly critical in recent months, wrote in one of five Twitter messages published during the blackout.

"I hope this implementation won't last long," he said in another Tweet. Gul has almost 4.5 million "followers" on the social media platform.

Above-average Turkish traffic

Twitter's own @support handle issued a message telling Turks how they could still write messages on the social media site using SMS "text" messages from their mobile phones. Meanwhile, cheat sheets in the Turkish language, explaining how to circumvent such bans more completely using Internet proxies and other workarounds, were distributed by members of the public in response.

According to the social media analysts at Brandwatch, more Twitter messages emanated from Turkey on Friday - in spite of the ban - than was the case on Wednesday before Erdogan's announcement.

Twitter boasts some 10 million Turkish users, with Turkish-language hash-tags regularly making the list of global trending topics. "#TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey" and "#TurkeyBlockedTwitter" both made the list on Friday.

Turkish voters will take part in local elections on March 30; the campaign has been impacted by the corruption allegations against the government.

The European Union commented critically on the attempted ban, after Erdogan had said he was "not interested" in the international reaction to his decision.

"The ban … raises grave concerns and casts doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards," EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Füle said in a statement. Turkey has long sought EU membership but is struggling with several outstanding hurdles to this target - not least the division of EU-member Cyprus.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers eligible for Obamacare health plans could see double-digit price hikes next year in states that fail to draw large numbers of enrollees for 2014, including some states that have been hostile to the healthcare law, according to insurance industry officials and analysts.

The early estimates come as insurance companies set out to design plans they intend to sell in 2015 through the state-based health insurance marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement that is widely referred to as Obamacare.

WellPoint Inc, which sells plans on 14 Obamacare exchanges, expects health insurance rates nationwide to be higher. Increases for the Obamacare market that has signed up about 5 million people to date is expected to outpace those in the employer-sponsored market, which serves about 170 million people.

"Looking at the rate increases on a year-over-year basis on our exchanges, and it will vary by carrier, but all of them will probably be in double digit plus," Ken Goulet, president of WellPoint's commercial business, told investors in New York on Friday.

The cost of health insurance is already a political hot potato in this year's election campaign for control of Congress, with Republicans warning of the potential for sky-rocketing rates in their attempt to turn the ballot into a referendum on Obamacare.

Insurers have noted the difficulty of building and pricing plans for 2015, which will mark the second year of the Obamacare exchanges. Enrollment for 2014 closes on March 31, giving them very little time to review the costs of covering their new members before submitting proposed rates to insurance regulators in May and June.

Industry officials and independent analysts say the lack of hard data will mean huge variations in premiums, with increases ranging from the high single-digit percentages in some states to as much as 30 percent in others.

Slow enrollment is a potential harbinger of big price hikes in over a dozen states, where technology failures or political opposition to Obamacare may have deterred younger and healthier residents from signing up.

Because the healthcare law prevents insurers from charging sick people higher premiums, the participation of healthy young people is needed to offset the cost of covering policyholders with preexisting conditions. Government data so far has shown about 25 percent of new Obamacare enrollees are in the younger demographic of adults aged 18 to 34, well below the White House's 38 percent target before last October's botched rollout.

Government actuaries predict an 8 percent increase in overall net insurance costs next year. Last week, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional committee: "I think premiums are likely to go up, but go up at a slower pace than what we've seen since 2010."

Some analysts say the more dire industry expectations reflect companies' uncertainty rather than the true costs of the market.

"I think it'll be the exception. But there will be some sections of the country with significantly higher insurance premiums," said Larry Levitt, a policy expert at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks healthcare trends.

Levitt predicts that most states will see premium increases of 7 percent to 10 percent in 2015, as insurers compensate for factors including the rising cost of medical services and reduced funding for a temporary federal program that compensates insurers for high claim costs.

COMPETITIVE PRESSURE

Levitt and other analysts said competition between plans should also brake upward price momentum in most states, while some consumers should also benefit from aggressive state insurance regulators unwilling to allow big cost hikes.

Even after the end of open enrollment, a steady stream of new customers is expected to transition into the Obamacare marketplaces throughout 2014, due to life changes that allow for special enrollments, including job loss, marriage and parenthood. As a result, insurers could find themselves under constant pressure to keep prices competitive.

"There's going to be this continuing need to market and get new enrollees," said Sarah Thomas, research director at the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions.###889||Turkey's ban on Twitter ahead of bitterly contested elections sparked public fury over a "digital coup" on Friday, brought international condemnation and triggered a rift between prime minister and president.

Twitter must get a legal representative in Turkey and agree to block individual accounts if it is to resolve a row that has led the government to block access to the service, Industry Minister Fikri Isik said on Friday.

Courts blocked access to Twitter after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local polls, to "wipe out" the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.

Tech-savvy Turks, President Abdullah Gul apparently among them, quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey rapidly moving to among the top trending globally.

"One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms," Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the pugnacious prime minister.

Corruption scandal

Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.

Turkey's main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country's bar association filed a separate court challenge.

Twitter users called it a "digital coup", some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.

There were also calls for protests.

"Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations," United States author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, wrote on his Twitter feed.

The ruling AK Party has already tightened internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts, and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which Erdogan has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.

Conciliatory figure

Gul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticise the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the brewing scandal and the latter's increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.

The two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.

Telecoms watchdog BTK said the courts had blocked Twitter after citizens complained that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.

"Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens," it said.

European Union enlargement commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and "cast doubt on Turkey's stated commitment to European values and standards". Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.

German disapproval

The government of Germany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British foreign office said social media had a "vital role to play in a modern democracy".

Turkey's financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the US dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24% from 11.12%.

San Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.

Erdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday.

"Twitter, mwitter!," he told thousands of supporters at a rally, in a phrase translating roughly as "Twitter, schmitter!".

"We will wipe out all of these," Erdogan said. "The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is," he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.

Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary. Finance Minister Mehmet also played down concerns, telling state broadcaster TRT Haber that the closure "does not derive from a prohibitive mentality" and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling. – Reuters###890||MtGox, the major Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, has said in a statement that they have found 200,000 of their missing bitcoins.

ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey's attempt to block access to Twitter appeared to backfire today with many tech-savvy users circumventing the ban and suspicions growing that the prime minister was using court orders to suppress corruption allegations against him and his government.

Turkey's telecommunications authority said it had blocked access to the social media network hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to "rip out the roots" of the website. Tweets have proliferated with links to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.

Turkey in the past has blocked access to YouTube, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country — to the point where Turkish hashtags routinely appear in global trends. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year.

By midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors.

President Abdullah Gul was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Gul, once a political ally of Erdogan, has spoken out against Internet censorship in the past, although last month he approved government moves to tighten controls over the Internet.

"I hope this implementation won't last long," he wrote.

Links to leaked recordings have been popping up on two Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan's instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government before March 30 local elections.

Erdogan has cast the elections as a referendum on his rule.

"Prime Minister Erdogan's move spells the lengths he will go to censor the flood of politically damaging wiretap recordings circulating on social media," said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Andrew Przybylski, a researcher at Britain's Oxford Internet Institute, said the ban appeared to be working through Domain Name System — or DNS — blocking, which was easy to work around.

He said many Twitter-hungry Turks manually changed the DNS settings on their computers and in their phones to point to Google's Domain Name System, which isn't affected by the ban.

Earlier, many users trying to access the network instead saw a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.

Turkey's lawyers' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey's main opposition party also applied for a cancellation.

Twitter's @policy account tweeted: "We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon."

Earlier, it sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or "SMS."

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey — a country that is seeking to join the European Union — as "groundless, pointless, cowardly." Other EU officials also voiced concerns.

Lutfi Elvan, Turkey's minister in charge of transport and communications, said Turkey was merely obeying court orders — although an Istanbul lawyers group argued the court decisions were about blocking access to websites deemed to be violating privacy — not the entire website. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating "personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives" and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.

"Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet," Elvan said. "We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness."

Technology Minister Fikri Isik said officials were holding talks with Twitter and that the ban would be lifted if an agreement is reached.

The original source of the leaked recordings is unclear. The ban comes amid rumors and news reports that even more damaging recordings are about to emerge.

"Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis," said Sinclair-Webb of Human Rights Watch.

In Berlin, the German government's human rights commissioner, Christoph Straesser, called on Turkey to reverse the decision immediately, saying "limiting freedom of the press and opinion on this scale is unacceptable."

Britain's Foreign Office also expressed concern, saying that social media has a "vital role to play" in modern democracy and helps promote transparency and public debate.###892||19 March 2014 By Mof Gimmers

As you may have heard, we'll be getting a new £1 coin which looks like an old threepenny bit, thereby ensuring future observational comedians the opportunity to coo "remember when quid coins were circular eh? What's that all about?"

Why are we getting a new pound? Well, apparently, it'll be the coin that is the hardest in the world to make a forgery of and has been described as a "giant leap into the future". As there are 43 million fake quid coins in circulation, you can understand why the Royal Mint might want to do something about it.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years’ loyal service the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world. With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency."

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."

The new coin will be 'bimetallic' like the £2 coin and will have new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint HQ.

The Royal Mint chief executive, Adam Lawrence, thinks this is an "exciting project" and added: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time. It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK’s currency in the process."

"We’re extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint’s Integrated Secure Identification System (iSis) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

We should see the new quid in 2017. If the Queen isn't on the throne by then, any coins made with her image will be worth a shedload to collectors, so if you see any knocking about or work at the Royal Mint, steal one now. As for the reverse of the coin, the Treasury has promised that there'll be a public competition to decide the design.

Mt. Gox, the embattled Japanese Bitcoin exchange that was hacked and filed for bankruptcy last month, said Thursday it found 200,000 Bitcoins held in an "old format wallet." CEO Mark Karpeles issued a statement on the Mt. Gox website claiming that the digital wallet was found while researching wallets used before June 2011.The wallet accounts for 24 percent of the total holdings the company had when the site crashed, losing more than $450 million in total value. At today's rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million. According to CNN Money, when the company filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo and the U.S. it filed with debts totaling $64 million.The company says it reported the finding to the bankruptcy court March 10, and had moved the bitcoins to offline, or "cold," storage by March 15.The new development is likely to cause a flare-up among the customers whose money has been lost since the crash. Mt. Gox was one of the biggest exchanges in the world when it stopped customers from withdrawing money, blaming the disruption on technical troubles and cyber attacks.Investors hold out little hope they will get their money back, as Japan had not regulated the exchange, and no deposit insurance was offered.Several other exchanges and Bitcoin banks sought to reassure their own investors and account holders after the crash, among them the U.S.-based Coinbase, which has more than 1 million consumer wallets.In a joint industry statement, the founders of Coinbase wrote, "As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today. ... We are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the Internet age."Mt. Gox did confirm privately some of their technical issues with fellow industry players who signed the joint statement, and software developers who collectively run the Bitcoin protocol also fixed a few of issues the company initially cited as contributing factors in the failure.###895||Mulberry's chief executive has left the luxury handbags firm after two years at the helm.

The departure of Bruno Guillon, who joined the Somerset-based company from Hermes in 2012, comes two months after a major profits warning.

He will be replaced on an interim basis by former boss Godfrey Davis, who oversaw the rapid growth of the Mulberry brand between 2002 and 2012.

Mr Davis, who will revert back to his old role of executive chairman until a successor is found, said Mr Guillon had improved the quality of the Mulberry offering and increased its appeal in international markets.

He added: "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

The company issued a profits warning within months of Mr Guillon's appointment in March 2012 and in June last year announced that creative director Emma Hill was to leave the luxury handbag maker.

Following her appointment in 2008, Ms Hill was credited with turning the firm from a trusted briefcase and wallet maker into an international fashion powerhouse with a clutch of celebrity fans.

The company's best known product of recent times has been the Alexa bag - inspired by style icon Alexa Chung - while its Del Rey bag was inspired by American artist Lana Del Rey.

Mr Guillon said last year that after three years of rapid growth he was laying the foundations for turning Mulberry into a global luxury brand.

He pointed out that with over 80% of sales derived from markets where the economic climate remains difficult, Mulberry's challenge was to accelerate its brand awareness in the United States and Asia.

However its recent warning left Mulberry on course for another year of falling profits, having slumped by more than a quarter in the 12 months to last March.

Mr Guillon was previously managing director of Hermes France, a position he held for four years. He joined Hermes in 2001, having previously worked at LVMH and Nina Ricci.

The New York Times reported:

From January until the end of March, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the HealthCare.gov site and administers the Affordable Care Act, will have spent $52 million on paid media, officials said.

That’s an average of $17 million a month on advertising, or $9 per signup if the administration reaches its revised enrollment goal of six million, The Daily Caller pointed out.

Which is still just a small percentage of the estimated $684 million that will be spent overall on publicity, marketing and advertising the Affordable Care Act, according to The Associated Press.

With ten days left until the deadline, the administration needs an additional one million people to sign up to meet its enrollment goal. Adding to its problems, the critical 18-35 demographic accounts for just 25 percent of the total, compared to original projections of 38.5 percent.

A reality that explains the growing number of unconventional appearances by President Obama to reach young adults.

Obamacare was designed to provide health insurance to the approximately 16 percent of Americans who are uninsured, and any real measure of success will be in accordance to the extent this number is reduced.

Reuters

The deal would cap a four-year investigation with one of the largest fines ever imposed on an auto maker.

It is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement which would allow Toyota 7203, +2.09% TM, -0.04% to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, and would appoint an external monitor to oversee Toyota’s adherence to conditions of the agreement, the people said.

The settlement isn’t final and could still fall apart, some of these people said.

A spokeswoman for Toyota said Toyota had already moved to address many of the issues raised in the investigation.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The investigation has been headed by the Manhattan offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney and focused on the way Toyota disclosed issues related to allegations of unintended acceleration in its cars in the late 2000s.

The Mountain View company named board member Michael Brown to take over as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.

No reason was given for the termination of Bennett, who was hired to replace ousted CEO Enrique Salem in July 2012, in hopes of reviving the struggling company. Because Bennett, previously Intuit’s CEO, was widely regarded as moving the company in the right direction, his firing left some industry experts flabbergasted.

“It’s a shocker,” said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. “This is a major, surprising move that they are getting rid of their CEO just as its recovery is playing out. They’re off to a very positive start. It’s a head-scratcher at this juncture. With him not there, you could see a lot of investors start to throw in the towel.”

Before the announcement, Symantec’s shares rose 33 cents to $20.91 at the market’s official close. But after the company reported Bennett’s ouster, its stock price fell $1.56, more than 7 percent, in after-hours trading.

Matthew Casey, an analyst with Technology Business Research, also expressed surprise.

“It kind of caught me off guard,” he said. “I know the results of their recent quarters haven’t necessarily been the most flashy in terms of growth.” But he added that the changes Bennett was trying to bring about, which largely involved streamlining Symantec’s business, “were the correct changes that needed to be made.”

Best known for its popular Norton antivirus software, Symantec has struggled in recent years against a proliferation of other security companies, such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye. Its $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software in 2005, in an effort to expand into the data storage business, also was widely criticized as a mistake.

In recent years, Symantec’s sales have been flat.

Last summer, Bennett cut about 1,000 jobs from Symantec’s workforce of about 20,000 and tried to find new product niches because slumping demand for personal computers had hurt its anti-virus sales. In recent months, it also has seen its chief technology offer and chief financial offer leave. But Symantec officials were vague about why Bennett was fired.

“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” the company said in a statement. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future.”

The statement added that “our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

But that explanation failed to satisfy Rick Holland, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.

“This completely caught me by surprise,” he said. “I wonder what happened, for real. What’s the story that we’re not getting here?”

And now another well-known name is entering the field: Walmart.

Walmart will next week launch its Video Game Trade-In program as part of its Gamecenter offering in-store. But why would you choose to trade-in at Walmart over visiting a dedicated games retailer? Because Walmart will take your games in return for a gift card, meaning you can use the cash to purchase anything in-store, online, or at Sam’s Club.

While such an offer may not be too appealing for gamers looking to buy more games, it’s certainly going to be of interest to parents, or someone looking to offload their games collection with no intention of embracing next-gen consoles just yet.

Walmart also wants to attract gamers who desire more games, though, so it’s promising to pay more for your used games while offering to sell new and used games cheaper. If they can pay more than other retailers, then Walmart will certainly do well, but we’ll have to wait until the service officially launches on March 26 to see how much better their prices are.

Although Walmart intends to start buying used games from customers from Wednesday next week, it looks like we may be waiting a while to see them reappear for sale on store shelves. A “Certified Pre-Owned” collection of games is planned, but it won’t become available until the summer. If you’re wondering what the certification means, Walmart claims each game will be refurbished and sold “like-new.”###907||Unemployment rates have fallen in 43 US states as more Americans begin looking for work and most quickly find jobs.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 per cent, while North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 per cent.###908||Empty###909||Turkish and global social media users have mocked moves by Turkey's government to restrict access to Twitter.

The hashtags #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #Turkey blockedTwitter became the top trending topics globally on Friday, just hours after the Turkish government imposed the ban.

The number of tweets from Turkey reportedly rose by 138 percent as savvy Internet users, including the country's president Abdullah Gul, found it easy to circumvent the shutdown.

"The whole world is laughing at you #ErdoganBlockedTwitter," users tweeted, as dozens of images mocking the ban - including one showing Twitter birds covering Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's head in droppings - were shared on the platform.

Another popular tweet shared a poster of the prime minister on a Barack Obama campaign poster with the message, "Yes, we ban".

Erdogan on Thursday night promised to "root out" and wipe out" the social media platform after users published claims of corruption against him.

Leaked recordings shared and linked on Twitter include one in which Erdogan allegedly instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police corruption probe.

Erdogan insists the recordings are fabricated "vile fakes" and part of a plot to discredit the government ahead of the March 30 election.

On Friday, Twitter users were forwarded a statement by twitter.com from Turkey's telecoms regulator, TIB, which cited court orders for the site's apparent closure.

Workarounds

Twitter also posted a message instructing Turkish users on how to continue using the service via SMS text message.

Many of the country's estimated 12 million Twitter users shared instructions on other workarounds for the ban, including the use of a virtual private network, or VPN, that hides the origin of tweets.

The ban was denounced as censorship throughout Turkey, including by President Gul, who tweeted that "the shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable".

"Besides, as I have said many times before it is technically impossible to close down communication technologies like Twitter entirely," Gul tweeted to his four million-plus followers.

The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gokcek, became the first member of Erdogan's own Justice and Development party to breach the ban. "I am able to tweet because my DNS settings allow it," he tweeted.

In response to the shutdown, Turkey's main opposition party, Republican People's Party, announced it would file a legal challenge to the court order.

The closure was also criticised globally, with the vice-president of the European Commission, Neelie Kroes, tweeting that the ban was "groundless, pointless, cowardly".

"Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is," Kroes said.###910||DENVER — Colorado clarified its marijuana packaging requirements Monday, extending to medical pot the same restrictions in place for recreational pot.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, who signed the bill into law, called it an important clarification to make sure minors don't illegally access marijuana.

"Marijuana should not be easily accessible or attractive to kids," Hickenlooper said.

The new law requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

Most medical marijuana sold commercially already complies with existing recreational packaging standards.

The new law also gives marijuana shops the same authority that liquor stores have to confiscate fraudulent IDs from underage consumers. It passed unanimously in both chambers of the Legislature.

"Everyone came together on this," said Rep. Daniel Kagan, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the law.

Dr. George Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency room physician from Children's Hospital Colorado, joined the bill signing and said there's anecdotal evidence of emergency rooms seeing more cases of youth marijuana overdoses.

But Wang said there's not enough data to draw conclusions on the effect of recreational pot, and that more study is needed.

"We've only been experiencing this for a couple years," Wang said.

Another new law signed Monday allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already completes state-level background checks.

Asked whether the marijuana industry needs additional curbs — including a possible potency limit or new limits on edible pot — Hickenlooper said it was too soon to advocate for more sweeping changes.

"This is brand-new territory," the governor said.

Some lawmakers have said they want to propose curbs on edible pot, but no such bill has yet been introduced.

Legislators are still mulling pot taxes. The first $40 million from pot excise taxes is devoted to education, but lawmakers will decide how to spend any additional tax revenue.

Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, wants to see a task force of lawmakers and industry activists discuss the best way to spend excess tax revenue. He met with industry representatives Monday.

Among the ideas from industry representatives were more money for researching the health effects of cannabis and trying again to create a state-chartered bank to serve the industry.

The mixed results did not stop Gov. Rick Scott from touting the latest numbers as he focused on the steady recovery of the state's economy.

"It is clear we're making a positive impact on businesses and families in Florida," Scott said in a statement. "We are creating an opportunity economy where businesses can continue to grow."

Scott has made the rebound in the state's economy a centerpiece of his re-election campaign this year. He has noted in campaign speeches that the unemployment rate increased under former Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist, who is now a Democrat and challenging Scott, has said Florida suffered because of the economic downturn that affected most of the nation and world.

The state's unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent, which was lower than it was at the end of the year. The rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.

There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work.

Despite the overall rate dropping slightly by 0.2 percent, the overall number of jobs in the state dropped by 2,600. The number of jobs is calculated using a separate survey.

Kevin Cate, a spokesman for Crist, noted the decline to jobs to blast Scott for "desperately attempting to take credit for a recovery that's more anemic than what the economy was already predicted to do on its own."

Florida overall has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Florida trailed Texas and California.

Scott has said the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies, including his push to cut back on regulation and lower taxes.

But economists who work for the Florida Legislature have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or delayed their job search.

Monroe County in the southern end of the state had the state's lowest unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, followed by Walton County in the Panhandle at 4.2 percent. Hendry County, in the southern interior, had the highest unemployment rate at 9.8 percent, followed by Flagler County at 9.3 percent.###914||Unemployment rates have fallen in 43 US states as more Americans begin looking for work and most quickly find jobs.

The Labor Department says the unemployment rate in January rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 per cent from 4.2 per cent. That's far below the national rate of 6.6 per cent that month.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs that month, below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 per cent, while North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 per cent.###915||Empty###916||Further updated France has used a space based radar system to pierce the clouds frustrating the Australian coordinated search for flight MH370 in the Southern Indian Ocean and found evidence of substantial debris which may be from the missing Malaysia Airlines 777.

Further updated

France has used a space based radar system to pierce the clouds frustrating the Australian coordinated search for flight MH370 in the Southern Indian Ocean and found evidence of substantial debris which may be from the missing Malaysia Airlines 777.

In an interview carried on the US ABC network and a Kuala Lumpur news site French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal says the seldom discussed satellite radar system “identified some debris that could be from the Malaysian Airlines plane”.

He said the radar echoes, which can be converted into black-and-white images, do not have the same “definition like a photograph, but they do allow us to identify the nature of an object and to localize it.”

Such space based radar sounding systems are rarely acknowledged by the world’s space powers in public discussions, with their capabilities and technologies referred to in little more than generalities.

However France’s use of the space radar, and its sharing of the southern ocean data with the MH370 search effort, brings an important new capability to bear in the zone between 2300-2600 kilometres SW of Perth where a range of objects which may be from the lost Boeing 777-200ER are being sought.

These include briefly glimpsed coloured restraining tapes floating in the vicinity of a wooden pallet which may have been used to secure cargo loaded in the belly of the Malaysia Airlines flight. Flight MH370 had 239 people on board when it took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on 8 March, only to disappear from air traffic control radar 42 minutes after departure.

Satellite radar soundings could penetrate the bad visibility that frustrated yesterday’s attempts by aircraft and ships to locate one or perhaps more large objects already seen at optical wavelengths by an American and a Chinese satellite on 16 March and 18 March respectively.

A late night update issued by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority says nothing new was found by air or sea in the search area yesterday Sunday, which despite earlier hopes for improved visibility, saw viewing conditions deteriorate and frustrate searchers. The statement didn’t refer to the new French satellite data which the authorities in KL said was sent to AMSA yesterday. There would be a very good reason for not referring to it should it involve disclosures about sensitive space systems capabilities.

Today’s search activities will have additional aircraft from China and Japan available for the first time, and the targets for aircraft and vessels will be refined using data from buoys dropped yesterday and the previous day to give real time information on wind and ocean current and wave conditions.

Update

In a radio interview this morning the Transport and Infrastructure Minister Warren Truss confirmed French reports that the objects identified by space radar are some 800 kilometres or so north of the areas where US and China satellite images found a large object last week, and where transient sightings were made in bad visibility of a wooden pallet and some cargo straps over the weekend.

After all night negotiations lasting into Thursday, March 20, EU member states and the parliament broke a deadlock on how to set up a joint authority that can restructure or shut down failing banks.

Corien Wortmann-Kool, a lead negotiator for the parliament, said that "this is very good for restoring confidence in European banks."

She said that under the new rules troubled banks could be dealt with "within a weekend" instead of the protracted process before that often undermined credibility in the EU's financial system.

Negotiators had insisted on reaching a deal before the European elections in May.###919||Following President Obama’s order on Thursday of sanctions against two dozen Russian citizens, credit card issuers Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and MasterCard Inc. (NYSE: MA) have stopped providing services to two Russian Banks. One bank, Bank Rossiya, was on the Treasury Department’s sanction list, while the other bank, SMP, was added.

SMP is owned by billionaire brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who are reported to be childhood chums of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Bank Rossiya is the country’s 15th largest bank, with $12 billion in assets, and is described by U.S. officials as the personal bank for senior Russian Federation officials. SMP, with assets of around $5 billion, is among Russia’s 40 largest banks.

The actions taken by Visa and MasterCard prevent bank customers from using their cards but do not prevent those customers from accessing their cash directly at the banks. SMP’s owners have objected to the card companies’ actions, according to Reuters:

Due to the fact that the sanctions were imposed on shareholders and not on the bank, we consider the moves by the payment systems unlawful and we are confident that we can resolve the encountered difficulties in the near future.

SMP also said it has no assets in the United States.

Fitch Ratings and S&P have both warned that Russia’s credit rating may be downgraded to reflect the potential impact on the country’s economy of the sanctions. Lower sovereign debt ratings mean that the Russian government would likely be forced to pay higher interest on its borrowing.

Russia’s MICEX index fell 2.1% Friday and is down more than 10% in the month of March.###920||Empty###921||Empty###922||The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###923||LinkedIn Corp. (NYSE: LNKD) CEO Jeff Weiner received the top grade in Glassdoor’s new “Highest Rated CEOs 2014.” The rating is based on employee answers to the question, “Do you approve of the way your CEO is leading your company?” LinkedIn has been one of the hottest public corporations traded on any U.S. exchange, both in terms of earnings and a stock price that has risen more than 100% during the past two years. Interestingly, company founders took many spots on the list.

At the top of the list are chief executives from both new and old economy companies. Alan Mulally of Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), widely lauded for turning around the company, ranked second. Ford was the only one of the Big Three automakers that did not file for Chapter 11 during the recession, and as such did not take any federal bailout money.

Third on the list is Richard W. Edelman, who runs the PR firm founder by his father.

Fourth on the list is Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM), a major provider of technology for smartphones. He is now the company’s executive chairman, having given up the CEO role to one of the firm’s veterans, Steve Mollenkopf. Jacobs’ father founded the firm.

Fifth on the list is Craig Jelinek of brick-and-mortar retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST), often cited as one of America’s best run retailers. He is followed by Brad Smith of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS).

The final three of the top 10 are Howard D. Schultz of Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX), another brick-and-mortar company; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), which is now one of the largest public corporations based on market cap, despite its modest revenue; and Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) CEO Larry Page. Page and Zuckerberg are also founders.

The extent to which old economy companies have a major presence on the list is because included among the top 50 are Edward C. “Ned” Johnson III of Fidelity, another family controlled firm; Mickey Drexler of brick-and-mortar retailer J. Crew; Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX); Bob Iger of Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS); and Blake W. Nordstrom, part of the founding family of brick-and-mortar retailer Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN).

Among new economy CEOs, Tim Cook of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) made the list, as did Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO).

Retail CEOs dominated much of the list, a surprise because these companies often are ranked low in customer service polls. Their employees must believe otherwise. Hubert Joly of troubled electronics retailer Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) is on the list, as is Frank Blake of Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD), Glenn K. Murphy of Gap Inc.

Moving swiftly after Crimeans voted in a referendum to join Russia, President Vladimir Putin said: “Our Western partners, led by the US, prefer to practice their politics guided not by international law, but the law of the strong. They have come to believe that they are exceptionally qualified and empowered to resolve the fates of the world. They bring power to bear against sovereign states and build coalitions based on the principle ‘whoever’s not with us is against us.’”

An annexation treaty Putin signed with pro-Russian Crimean leaders says the autonomous territory will be fully integrated into Russia after a transition period.

Kyiv, Brussels and Washington twitched.

At least, that’s how jubilant Muscovites and their politicians interpreted Western expressions of outrage over the move and a first phase of sanctions. The powerful in Moscow scoffed at the measures.

In contrast, in the biggest crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War, US President Barack Obama sought to present his Russian counterpart’s move as motivated by impotence at home — troops in Crimea or not.

Obama said: “The truth is that Mr. Putin acted out of weakness, not out of strength. We are not going to be getting into a military excursion in Ukraine. What we are going to do is mobilise all of our diplomatic resources to make sure that we’ve got a strong international coalition that sends a clear message, which is that Ukrainians should decide their own destiny.”

Russia accuses the new pro-Western authorities in Kiev of endangering Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. It says it will insist that its compatriots’ rights and freedoms be fully respected.

Warning of the risks that could come with a weak response to Moscow’s absorption of Crimea, Washington foreign policy pundits Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft have been analysing Putin’s justification of his moves against Ukraine. Both Americans are former US National Security Advisors.

At a conference at the Center for Strategic & International Studies think tank in Washington, DC, they said a surprisingly efficient annexation of Crimea ends a quarter of a century of constructive relations between Russia and the United States.

According to Brzezinski: “We have to convey to the Russians our concern that those words spoken by Putin are terribly reminiscent of what Hitler was saying about Austria before the Anschluss [the occupation and annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938], which was then followed by the Sudetenland [areas of other countries inhabited mostly by German speakers], and we know the rest of the history. And that could be very serious in Europe. Either we can be passive in the face of a calamitous explosion or maybe the Ukrainians will fall apart and simply there will be a repetition of what happened in Crimea.”

In Scowcroft’s opinion: “Putin is a different person, a very different person from Gorbatchev or even from Khrushchev, and he has the outlook of someone who was KGB and who saw the Soviet Union collapse. He is a person full of venom, because he thought that that collapse was taken advantage of by the West, especially by the United States, to humiliate Russia or take advantage of Russia.”

Neither Scowcroft nor Brzezinski see Europe’s new insecurity as a return to the Cold War; they see it in a different context of 21st century reality.

Brzezinski: “Putin has to consider: can he really undertake a war at this stage in the heart Europe given the state of his economy, which is really very bad, and the relatively retarded state of his military, which is only now being modernised? If he did this ten years from now, he might be in much better shape. But right now, I don’t think a serious conflict in that part of Europe is something that Putin would welcome. He would like to have a quickie: either the break-up of Ukraine or some upheaval within Ukraine. And I think we have to reassure him in a constructive fashion that that is somewhat unlikely, because we have interests too.”

Scowcroft said Putin’s action could have been averted if the West had paid attention to Urkaine’s economy, but, he said, both the US and Europe have been lazy about the whole thing.

Scowcroft: “The EU made an offer for a relationship with Ukraine. It didn’t amount to anything. Putin turns around and offers a 15 billion dollar loan. What the United States could have done at that time and I think should have done is to say, look, Ukraine’s economy is in terrible shape, let’s us, the United States, the EU and Russia put together a programme of assistance to Ukraine.”

Our correspondent Stefan Grobe asked Brzezinski if the initial sanctions taken against Russia are enough.

Brzezinski answered: “Well, they [the sanctions] are like the introductory phase of a dinner, just a little bit of a preliminary bite, but not too much bite.

Grobe: “Do you expect more?”

Brzezinski: “Yes.”

Grobe concludes: “The foreign policy establishment in Washington is deeply troubled by Putin’s action and by the Western response. The hope is that President Obama and the European allies at the EU summit in Europe next week will find a more muscular approach.”###928||Empty###929||Empty###930||Empty###931||12-sided design reprises threepenny bit as Royal Mint and Treasury say existing coin is too easy to forge

A new 12-sided pound coin based on the threepenny bit is being unveiled – and is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a “giant leap into the future” the new coin will replace a familiar token that the Treasury says has a 3% forgery rate – amounting to a total of more than 45m in circulation.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the “threepenny bit”, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor the new coin – which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 – will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a “bimetallic” construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint’s headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.



A Treasury spokesman said: “After 30 years’ loyal service the time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.



“With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

George Osborne (@George_Osborne) Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4

“We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit.”



The Royal Mint chief executive, Adam Lawrence, hailed the “exciting project”, adding: “The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.



“It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK’s currency in the process.



“We’re extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint’s Integrated Secure Identification System (iSis) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost.”



As with all British coins the Queen’s effigy will be on the “heads” side, while the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the “tails” side.



A Bank of England spokesman said: “Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank’s decision to produce polymer banknotes this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.”



National Crime Agency counterfeiting expert John Sheridan said: “The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency.”###932||Shanghai stocks edged up in mixed trading this morning.

Is it possible that the investigation was getting a bit too close for comfort? We can’t confirm that based on speculation, but there are many investors that have been suspicious of how Mt. Gox has handled several things.In an announcement posted on the Mt.

These bitcoins were discovered on March 7th, just one week after the filing for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo. Mt. Gox had originally stated that they lost nearly all of the 850,000 bitcoins. They blamed the loss on hacking, theft and software issues which resulted in the site being shut down. Karpeles also stated that he reported the discovery to lawyers on March 8th, and that the bitcoins were later moved to “offline” wallets for security reasons on March 14th & March 15th.Mt. Gox also filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on March 10th, and their debts are stated to be about $64 million.Today’s startling announcement ends with, “Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC, the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC. (Please note that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared is still under investigation and that the above figures may still change depending on the results of the investigation.)”While Mt.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs said Monday that the settlement for economic loss following certain recalls in 2009 and 2010 does not impact ongoing litigation for personal injury or wrongful death claims related to alleged unintended acceleration.

"It's a relief to know that Toyota is offering substantial benefits to a very large number of Canadian consumers in order to resolve these actions. I think that this is a fair settlement for Toyota owners across the country," said Steven Hamilton, the representative plaintiff for members of the Ontario class.

The settlement — approved by courts in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan — provides class members with a customer support program for a minimum of three years and up to 10 years to cover all parts and labour costs for certain vehicle components.###936||Empty###937||Empty###938||Get daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

Today's Budget will include at least one money-making scheme for Wales, with the Royal Mint at Llantrisant ready to roll out the replacement for the £1 coin.

The new £1 will have the same 12-sided shape of the “threepenny piece” which vanished with decimalisation in 1971.

According to the Royal Mint, about 3% of all £1 coins (or 45 million) are now forgeries. The present £1 has been in circulation for more than three decades – much longer than the lifetime of a typical coin – and is prey to counterfeiters.

The new “bi-metallic” two-colour coin should be introduced in 2017 and will be roughly the same size as the £1 coin, and the Royal Mint – which developed the technology at its South Wales base – is confident it will be “the most secure coin in the world”.###939||Empty###940||"I'm trying to follow and figure out who the winners are in this tariff war," said North Dakota farmer Greg Gebeke.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin’s inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin’s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin’s lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 per cent in midday trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 per cent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

Though customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or even withdraw cash from ATMs, the clients can get cash directly from the banks.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country’s central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to “take the bank’s clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them,” according to the Interfax news agency.

Describing Rossiya, which was rumoured to serve nearly everyone in Putin’s close entourage, as “just an average bank,” Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one “first thing on Monday” and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia’s central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.”

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.###942||Empty###943||Tips for a good mortgage

Integrated Secure Identification Systems (iSIS) is the result of R&D from engineers at The Royal Mint that has so far seen £2m of investment into a coin that will have ‘covert’ security embedded into it for the first time.

Launched in May 2013, iSIS is said to give coins three tiers of ‘banknote-strength security’ that can be authenticated through high-speed automated detection. A survey undertaken in November 2013 found that the rate of counterfeit UK £1 coins in circulation at the time had risen from 2.74 per cent to 3.04 per cent, and the Royal Mint add that a new level of detection in vending machines will also be possible too, thereby removing this method of introducing fake coins.

Expected to be introduced in 2017, the new 12-sided coin will be constructed from two different – but as yet unspecified – coloured metals.

According to Royal Mint, iSIS is expected to reduce costs by replacing expensive clad and homogeneous coins with a more affordable full-plated option rather than a surface coating that is prone to wear over time.

In a statement Adam Lawrence, chief executive of The Royal Mint said: ‘We are already known as the world’s leading export mint, but iSIS confirms our place as leaders within our industry, as we continue to expand the boundaries of minting technology.’

A public consultation will be held over the summer before a final decision is made on the precise specification of the new coin.###945||Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired chief executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10 per cent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," the company said.

"It's a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company's turnaround. I view this as a major step back ...," FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.###946||MOSCOW, Russia — Russia's move to annex Crimea may have sent the patriotic masses here into a jubilant frenzy, but it’s left the small community of liberals and opposition activists wringing hands over worries about a future of growing isolation and authoritarianism.

“You hear this word ‘totalitarian’ when people share their anticipations about the future,” says Masha Lipman of the Carnegie Moscow Center. “I would say there’s no disagreement that harder times are in store.”

Social media has been awash with expressions of gloom and shame. “People! What’s happened to our country?” Yuri Timofeyev, a photographer for the news website Grani.ru, wrote on Facebook after Russian troops invaded Ukraine’s Black Sea peninsula. “Fallen apart?”

President Vladimir Putin’s signature on Friday finalized Russia’s fast-track annexation of Crimea, condemned by most of the international community and punished by the West with sanctions against his inner circle.

The EU added 12 more Russian officials to its list shortly after, including the powerful deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and two Putin aides.

But on the home front, Putin’s confrontation with the West has earned him his highest ratings in years by playing to the conservative sentiments he’s cultivated since returning to the presidency two years ago.

Russians have been treated to a heavy-handed state-run media campaign of imperial nostalgia and historical revisionism aimed at portraying Crimea — which holds a special place in the collective imagination here — as Russia’s rightful property.

Almost 80 percent of respondents said they supported annexing Crimea in a survey conducted earlier this month by the independent pollster Levada Center.

The same poll found 58 percent backed sending Russian troops into Crimea and other regions of Ukraine, including the east, where unrest continues to simmer.

That’s unsettling Moscow’s chattering classes, which see a darker side to Putin’s ambitions.

He has “cynically raised nationalist fervor to a fever pitch; imperialist annexation is a strategic choice to bolster his regime’s survival,” Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition politician, wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday.

“Mobilizing the masses by distracting them from real problems like corruption and economic stagnation can take place only beneath the banner of fighting external enemies.”

Among those enemies are Ukraine’s fledgling post-revolutionary authorities, now scrambling to reassert control over a divided country in the wake of a protest movement partly spearheaded by nationalist groups painted here as “Fascists.”

Moscow’s campaign to win back Crimea has included appeals to locals there touting Russia’s political stability and brighter economic future.

Critics here in Moscow argue the Kremlin’s land-grab is being presented through rose-colored glasses.

Arkady Babchenko, a prominent Moscow journalist, echoed that view in a sardonic column titled “Welcome, Crimea!” in which he acquainted Crimeans with Russia’s stuffy state-controlled media, forced military conscription and crippling corruption.

“You will no longer choose — nothing, never,” he wrote in the magazine Snob. “Not even the colors of the curb in your courtyard.”

As the geopolitical drama unfolds in Ukraine, the independent media at home is being subjected to largely underreported crackdown.

Earlier this year, TV Rain — Russia’s only critical-minded television station — was dropped by major cable providers after it aired a poll asking viewers whether the Soviets should have surrendered St. Petersburg, then called Leningrad, during its brutal 900-day siege at the hands of Nazi Germany during World War II in order to save countless lives.

Kremlin-loyal bureaucrats lashed out over what they called an affront to historical memory.

On Thursday, reports suggested that TV Rain may be kicked out of its studios in a sprawling central Moscow complex that houses much of the remaining independent media.

Meanwhile, the well-respected editor of a major news website, Lenta.ru, was fired last week after her outlet published an interview with a leading Ukrainian nationalist whose militant right-wing group played a key role in the protests. Russian police have charged him in absentia with “extremism.”

The editor, Galina Timchenko, was replaced by a Kremlin-friendly journalist while much of the staff resigned in protest.

Lipman, the Carnegie researcher, says the independent media sector is “noticeably shrinking” thanks to such measures.

“For someone who has lost a job with a decent publication — by decent, I mean guided by professionalism and not a desire to please the Kremlin — there are fewer and fewer opportunities,” she says.

That’s part of a broader development of state-enforced patriotism aimed at breeding loyalty to the Kremlin, Lipman adds.

If there were any doubts, one need only look at Navalny, who was arrested last month and placed under house arrest for two months. His immensely popular blog — where he’s uncovered graft and lavish spending by the members of the country’s ruling class — was blocked last week after he criticized Russian policy in Crimea.

Perhaps most telling, however, has been the fate of Roman Romanenko, an otherwise unnoticed journalist in the Vologda Region— about 300 miles northeast of Moscow — who jokingly appealed to Putin send in troops to protect the Russian speakers in his region.

Moscow’s incursion into Crimea was launched under the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking residents from an allegedly predatory government in Kyiv.

“Our sick are unable to obtain the medicine and treatment they need, the level of our education drops every year, children's after-school programs are being shut down, agriculture has been virtually destroyed,” Romanenko wrote on Facebook.

“We are suffering very much.”

The humor apparently didn’t register with the regional governor, who requested that Romanenko be investigated over his appeal.###947||SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Shares of Symantec Corp. tumbled Friday, a day after the security software company abruptly terminated Chief Executive Steve Bennett.

Symantec SYMC, +2.67% fell 13% to close at $18.20 on the sudden management change. Board member Michael Brown has been named interim CEO.

“While the timing of this is unfortunate with only 11 days left in the fiscal year, the company did reiterate long-term and fiscal fourth quarter guidance,” J.P. Morgan analyst John DiFucci told clients in a note.

While Bennett pursued the right strategy for the company, he argued, “his execution did not go as well as planned, and I believe product innovation has been slower than anticipated by the board.”

Symantec was the worst performer on the S&P 500 SPX, +0.56% which was down a fraction.

Technology stocks were mostly lower, with Hewlett-Packard HPQ, +0.04% up 1.5% to close at $31.95 and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.82% gaining 1.6% to close at $50.92.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.38% shed nearly 1% to close at 4,277. But tech-heavy benchmark ended the week up nearly 1%.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index SOX, -0.85% and the Morgan Stanley High Tech 35 US:MSH Index were down a fraction on Friday.

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.



“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”



How it Works

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary.



Certified Pre-Owned Video Games in Stores Later this Year



Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com. The video games will be labeled “Certified Pre-Owned” which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.



“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” added Mac Naughton.###949||Empty###950||JavaScript is disabled in your browser.

Canada is ranked as the 21st largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.

The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.

The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. Bell Canada, Rogers Wireless, and Telus Internet are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.

There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.###952||The United States on Friday hit out at Turkey''s banning of the online social network Twitter and urged Ankara to restore access to what it called "basic communication tools."

The United States on Friday hit out at Turkey''s banning of the online social network Twitter and urged Ankara to restore access to what it called "basic communication tools."

WASHINGTON - The United States on Friday hit out at Turkey's banning of the online social network Twitter and urged Ankara to restore access to what it called "basic communication tools."

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said an order to prevent Turks from accessing the US firm's micro-blogging site was "contrary to Turkey's own expressed desire to be a model of democracy."

"The United States supports freedom of expression in Turkey and opposes any action to encroach on the right to free speech," she told reporters.

"We urge the Turkish government to unblock its citizens' access to Twitter and ensure free access to all social media platforms."

The White House said it was "deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens' access to basic communication tools."

Washington has conveyed its concerns to the Turkish government and supports "the people of Turkey in their calls to restore full access to the blocked technologies," White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.

Psaki added she was not aware of any moves by the US administration to play a role in negotiations between Twitter and the Turkish government.

But she stressed that "democratic governments must accept the challenge to... listen to the voices who disagree with us."

"An independent and unfettered media is an essential element of democratic, open societies and crucial to ensuring official transparency and accountability," Psaki added.

The markets are following fast-moving events in the Ukraine, as Crimea has voted to join Russia and the EU and the US have responded with limited sanctions. Turning to economic news, German ZEW Economic Sentiment looked awful, sliding to a ten-month low. The Eurozone indicator also slipped badly. As well, the German Constitutional Court confirmed the legality of the European Stability Mechanism. In the US, there are two major events on the schedule - Core CPI and Building Permits.

Events are moving quickly in the Ukrainian crisis. Voters in Crimea voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in Sunday's referendum, and Russian Prime Minister Putin has recognized Crimea as an independent state, paving the way for annexation. Putin will address a special session of the Russian parliament on Tuesday. The EU and US have responded with targeted sanctions, freezing assets of several high-ranking Russian officials. Additional sanctions are expected, possibly as early as this week.

US releases looked weak on Friday. PPI posted a decline for the first time since November, coming in at -0.1%. The estimate stood at +0.2%. Preliminary UoM Consumer Sentiment dropped below the 80-point level for the first time since November, slipping to 79.9 points. This was short of the estimate of 81.9 points. The weak PPI points to persistently low inflation numbers, which is indicative of an underperforming economy. Recent US numbers have certainly not dazzled, but they should be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to go ahead with another taper of QE. This would be the third trim of the Fed's asset-buying scheme, and would reduce QE to $55 billion per month. These tapers are dollar-positive and mark a vote of confidence in the US economy by the Federal Reserve.

The European Stability Mechanism, which is the Eurozone's bailout fund, was confirmed as legal by the German Federal Constitutional Court on Tuesday. Germany is the biggest contributor to the EUR 970 billion fund. In February, the court deferred a decision on the Outright Monetary Transactions, which is credited with saving weak members of the Eurozone, to the European Court of Justice.

The number of Turkish tweets rose 33 percent after the blocking of Twitter, according to Somera.

The number of active Twitter users, as well as tweets posted, has soared since the Turkish government blocked access to the popular social media platform.Access to Twitter was blocked at 23:00 on March 20. However, according to figures published by social media rating agency Somera , over 6 million Turks tweeted from March 20, 23:00, to March 21, 12:00. Only 4.5 million tweets were sent the previous day in the same time slot, when there was no blocking. The difference corresponds to a 33 percent rise.The number of actively tweeting Turkish users has also risen by 17 percent, from 1.49 million to 1.75 million comparing the same periods. Turkish activity on Twitter had been 16 percent lower than the previous day just before the block. However, as soon as access was blocked it rose sharply, and it remained hitting record highs even at 03:00 a.m., as seen in the graph:Most users therefore seem to have got around the access ban and entered Twitter via VPN tunnels.The ban comes on the heels of damaging revelations following the corruption probe and the successive release of phone conversations of government officials, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Some observers have interpreted the decision to ban Twitter as an attempt to prevent further damaging leaks ahead of the March 30 local polls. However, Erdoğan said the government undertook such measure “for the sake of its citizens.” “I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic’s state,” he added.###960||Empty###961||Bentonville – Walmart is getting in on a business that impacts more than 110 million gamers across the country.

“It’s a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company’s turnaround. I view this as a major step back …,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland said Symantec had been losing market share to nimbler network security software makers such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Checkpoint Systems Inc.

Symantec said it was committed to its target of more than 5 percent organic growth and higher than 30 percent adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

However, BMO Capital analyst Joel Fishbein said it would be difficult for Symantec to achieve 5 percent revenue growth without mergers and acquisitions or divestiture due to a continuing fall in its main PC security and storage businesses.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported in January a 5 percent decline in revenue for the third quarter ended December 27.

Bennett had said the fall in revenue was partly due to changes in the structure of the company’s sales team.

Symantec had been reorganizing its sales force to create specialists for each product group instead of having everyone sell everything.

Bennett, a former CEO of financial software maker Intuit Corp, was appointed by President Obama to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in July.

“Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you can just add this to the list,” Ives said.

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for current quarter ending March 2014.

MOSCOW (AP) - Russian stocks were under pressure Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered economic sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin's entourage.

Fears over Russia's economic outlook have ratcheted up this week as the country annexed Crimea following Sunday's hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate and has slapped on sanctions in response.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin's inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin's chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin's lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury's sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia's 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a "personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation."

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that their bank cards are not as useful as they were. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services "without prior notification." SMP's co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg - billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin - were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia's top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard's actions as "illegitimate" because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won't be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank's. They can also get cash directly inside their banks' branches.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country's central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to "take the bank's clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them."

Describing Rossiya, which was rumored to serve nearly everyone in Putin's close entourage, as "just an average bank," Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one "first thing on Monday" and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia's central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. "does not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability."

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor's in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia's debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia's economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia's BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country's borrowing costs more expensive.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov lambasted the move, saying it was not an objective decision and that somebody "ordered" it.

"Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support," Fitch said.

The six-year-old San Francisco start-up epitomizes the sharing economy, by allowing people to rent out unused rooms in their home — or entire islands and castles — to anyone looking for a place to crash.

The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the funding negotiations, detailing that private equity firm TPG is likely to lead the round. If successful, Airbnb will become one of the richest young tech companies around.

Based on the most recent information available, Airbnb operates in 192 countries and has more than 600,000 current listings. Hosts set a nightly rate, and Airbnb collects a percentage of the payment. It does not disclose its revenues.

While being able to raise that kind of loot is impressive, Airbnb will be under the gun to find a lucrative way of investing the cash to create enough value for investors when it exits. One challenge that it faces — which will no doubt be expensive — is the company’s fights with public officials, who are asking whether it is violating local regulations.

These setbacks are common for companies in the sharing economy, with other start-ups, like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar facing increased scrutiny around the globe.

The sheer size of the round makes this deal outstanding, but what’s potentially more startling is how Airbnb will rank among its publicly held peers once the deal is compete (of course, negotiations can always break down and the deal may never materialize).

Check out how a $10 billion valuation compares to some of the leading hotel chains and booking sites’ current market caps:

— Expedia: $9.8 billion.

— HomeAway: $3.9 billion.

— Wyndham Worldwide: $9.3 billion.

— Hyatt Hotels: $8.43 billion.

— Priceline: $68.6 billion.

— Orbitz: $878 million.###969||Symantec has terminated Steve Bennett as CEO and replaced him with board member Michael Brown as president and chief exec on an interim basis.

“These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.”

The company also confirmed a special committee of the board will immediately commence the search for a new permanent CEO, as well as republishing its fiscal outlook previously published on January 29. Symantec’s revenue will be of $1.615 to $1.655bn, compared to $1.748bn a year ago.

Yet the CEO shuffle is grabbing the headlines. Schulman added: “Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth.

“This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

In other words, rearrange the following – man dead walking – and you’ve pretty much got it.

Bennett’s tenure at Symantec may be seen more sympathetically with the benefit of hindsight given his remit was to slim down and transform the company, having said when he took the helm: “I believe our assets are better than our performance and I need to understand what’s in the way.”

The company married up its MDM and MAM offerings at the Symantec Vision convention in Las Vegas back in April, with the suite also offering mobile mail client, single sign on for MAM and MAM connection security, proving the value of enterprise mobility in its portfolio.

Whoever takes over the reins at Symantec will perhaps want to go better than emulating Bennett, or the previous CEO Enrique Salem, who left in July 2012, but John W. Thompson, chief exec from 1999 and 2009 and now chairman of the board of directors at Microsoft.

The company said they had nothing further to add when Enterprise AppsTech enquired.

Latest Geeky Gadgets Deals###971||Empty###972||Empty###973||Shanghai stocks edged up in mixed trading this morning. Distilleries gained while property developers slumped as data showed home prices rose in fewer cities in February.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent, or 5.99 points, to 2,029.66. Turnover was 46 billion yuan (US$7.5 billion) by midday.

Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd led the gains of distilleries, rising 5.3 percent to 175.31 yuan, after the Shanghai Securities News reported that the state-owned liquor maker plans to list Guizhou Xijiu, a unit of its portfolio, in Hong Kong later this year.

Most homebuilders were sluggish after the National Bureau of Statistics showed that 57 of the 70 major cities in China recorded rises in new home prices, down from 62 in January.

Poly Real Estate lost 2.1 percent to 6.93 yuan. Gemdale Corporation shed 1.1 percent to 6.27 yuan. Deluxe Family Co Ltd slipped 2.2 percent to 4.07 yuan.

The real estate sector was also depressed by media reports that a property company in Zhejiang Province went bankrupt as it failed to pay 3.5 billion yuan of debts, fueling worries about defaults.

Shanghai Jinfeng Investment Co, however, surged by the daily limit of 10 percent to 5.75 yuan after it said Greenland Holding Group Co will buy 65.5 billion yuan worth of stake in the company for a back-door listing.###974||



The move could cut costs for consumers, as prices climb ever higher for new titles. But the retail giant's entry into the business poses a serious competitive threat to leading used games vendor GameStop ( GME ), along with many mom-and-pop game shops around the U.S. Big video-game publishers are also likely grumble about more lost dollars to the second-hand market.





Walmart said early Tuesday that it will begin dealing in used video games on March 26, initially focusing on titles for the PlayStation, Xbox and Wii systems. The company says the used video-game market is worth $2 billion. It could be even more lucrative if people would sell more the 880 million old video games they have sitting around the house.

For those customers who don't normally get into a GameStop, Walmart is offering an option for those games collecting dust at home. The company says it will pay more for used games -- in the form of store credit -- and sell them for less money than competitors. Used games will sell for an average of $35.





Investors will likely be looking closely at whether GameStop, the biggest video-game seller in the country, can survive the move. The company's stock rose 2 percent Monday to close at $39.75. Investors will likely be looking closely at whether GameStop, the biggest video-game seller in the country, can survive the move. The company's stock rose 2 percent Monday to close at $39.75.





The company is already threatened by a broad industry move to online and disk-less gaming, though it does offer exclusive digital content with major game releases. You don't need to visit GameStop to play "Candy Crush Saga," for example.





Meanwhile, used games are where GameStop rakes in the cash, with a margin of nearly 50 percent, reports analysts at Trefis . GameStop is trying to diversify by also selling used tablets and smartphones.





Overall, used video-game sales make up a fraction of the industry. Last month, about 56 percent of all U.S. video game spending went to new game products. Another 35 percent went to online and mobile downloads, The NPD Group reports . Only about 9 percent went to used game sales and rentals.





How will Walmart change those numbers? And how many price-conscious customers will now leave the retailer's video-game aisles with a used disk rather than a new one? Certainly, Walmart has the power to significantly drive sales of pre-owned games, sales that to this point have been a mostly niche business.

Walmart ( WMT ) is set to start buying and selling used video games, a move that promises to send shock waves across the gaming industry.###975||Empty###976||1 of 2 View Caption

Those kind of valuations are par for the course for today's net startups really, but it's still a strong vote of confidence for a company that's facing legal issues over its business model.

Sources told the Wall Street Journal and Reuters that TPG Capital Management was leading the funding round, which could net the firm more than $400m.

Airbnb makes its money by taking a fee on private rentals, either where a homeowner rents out a room in their house to holidaymakers or where there rent out entire apartments, such as holiday apartments they own that are vacant the rest of the year. The trouble comes when tenants start to rent out rooms and flats they're renting, running the risk of falling foul of subletting laws.

Just like fellow so-called "sharing economy" startup Uber, which lets people share rides in cars and hire out vehicles, Airbnb has run into trouble at home in the US. In New York, tenants are prohibited from renting out their homes for less than 30 days if they are not present at the time and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has subpoenaed Airbnb for data on its hosts in the area to figure out if they broke the law.

The company's home town, San Francisco, is also looking into the legality of short-term rentals after tenancy advocates claimed the service was driving up rent prices and stripping the market of supply.

Airbnb argues that their hosts are mostly at home for the rentals so they're not illegal and says that the service helps people to pay their rent and generates revenue for local economies.

Earlier this year, the firm claimed that it was generating £502m in economic activity in the UK and supported 11,629 jobs.

“With Airbnb, more people are earning the extra money they need to pay their bills or pursue their dreams,” chief exec and co-founder Brian Chesky said.

But critics say that people are running illegal, highly profitable businesses by renting and then subletting many empty apartments at once - and avoiding hotel and rental-related taxes in the process. ®

Sponsored: Following Bottomline’s journey to the Hybrid Cloud###978||Visa and MasterCard have stopped servicing the credit cards of customers using Russian banks affected by the economic sanctions announced in Washington, the banks said

Several Russian banks on Friday saw their customers barred from using Visa and MasterCard credit cards as US economic sanctions over Russia's takeover of Crimea began to dig in.

US-based Visa and MasterCard have stopped servicing the credit cards of customers at Russian banks due to the economic sanctions announced in Washington, the banks said Friday.

A Visa spokesman told ITAR-TASS news agency that the move was to "in order to comply with US law" and concerned four banks: Bank Rossiya, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and InvestKapitalBank.

US President Barack Obama on Thursday said a list of Russians targeted by sanctions had been extended to include billionaire businessmen bankers believed to be close to Putin.

One bank, Bank Rossiya, was also added, described as a "crony bank" for the elite.

Americans and American businesses, such as Visa and MasterCard, are forbidden from any dealings with anyone targeted by the sanctions and any assets they might have in the United States are frozen.

Clients of the banks on Friday found themselves unable to use their credit cards to make purchases or to withdraw money from cash machines not belonging to the banks.

Bank Rossiya said in a statement that Visa and MasterCard had "without warning stopped providing its payment services to the bank's clients."

Bank Rossiya's affiliate banks, Sobinbank and InvestKapitalBank, were also affected.

Putin responded Friday by defiantly vowing to open an account at Bank Rossiya and have his salary transferred there.

SMP Bank, which is controlled by US-blacklisted brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, said in a statement that it believed the blocking of its customers' credit cards was "unlawful" because the sanctions targeted not the bank but its shareholders.

- 'Tens of thousands' affected -

None of the banks affected have a major high-street presence, but Bank Rossiya is used by companies within Gazprom energy giant to pay salaries to staff, the Interfax news agency reported.

"The main focus of Bank Rossiya is corporate clients... so this will not prompt public panic," said banking analyst Mikhail Kuzmin of Investcafe.ru.

"I don't think Bank Rossiya has many funds in the US, it's mainly businesses within Russia, they are not under any threat."

Kuzmin estimated to AFP that "tens of thousands" of people were affected at all the banks.

Bank Rossiya came 15th in a ranking of Russian banks by Interfax news agency last year in terms of the size of its assets.

Russia's Central Bank said in a statement on Bank Rossiya on Friday that "the operations that come under sanctions are not having a significant impact on the financial stability of the credit organisation".

"If necessary, suitable measures will be taken to support the credit organisation and give reliable protection of the interests of its account holders and creditors," the Central Bank added.

- A 'negative' effect -

So far the economic sanctions "will not affect Russian business as a whole," said Yevgeny Nadorshin, chief economist at AFK Sistema.

"These sanctions send a signal that the US did not stop at its first round (of sanctions). But it's a long way from a serious influence on the economy," he told AFP.

"If the sanctions limit the possibility of making payments to foreign agents, that would be very serious. Most Russian companies doing business with foreign partners make payments in dollars and have American accounts."

Fitch ratings agency on Friday lowered its outlook for Russia from stable to negative, a day after Standard & Poor's did the same.

That prompted an angry response from Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, who told Russian news agencies that the outlook was lowered "on orders, not objectively."

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the introduction of sanctions undoubtedly had a "negative" effect on perceptions and could lead to Russia "halting external borrowing and cutting part of its domestic borrowing," in comments to RIA Novosti news agency.###979||A Tuesday evening report from CNN cites an anonymous source who said that the U.S. Department of Justice and Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM) have reached a settlement in the criminal investigation of the sudden acceleration of Toyota vehicles. The company recalled more than 8 million vehicles in 2009 and 2010 after reports of sudden, unintended acceleration that may have been responsible for 75 fatal accidents that killed 93 people.

According to CNN, Toyota will pay more than $1 billion to settle the criminal investigation in a deal that could be announced as soon as Wednesday. The company has already paid out billions of dollars to settle civil claims related to the accidents.

The Justice Department investigation was initiated to determine what Toyota knew and when it knew it. The company’s public statements and disclosures to regulators were found to be misleading at least, and the unprecedented size of the settlement should be a warning shot across the bow of General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM).

GM’s recent recalls of 1.6 million vehicles to repair a problem with the vehicles’ ignition switch has all the hallmarks of a series of questionable public statements and even more questionable company decisions going to 2003. So far 13 deaths and numerous injuries have been attributed to the ignition switch defect.

Toyota stock closed down 0.76% on Tuesday, at $109.83 in a 52-week range of $99.70 to $134.94.

GM stock closed up 1.56% to $35.17 and added another 0.23% in after-hours trading. The stock’s 52-week range is $27.11 to $41.85.###980||There are several points of consideration that will affect a premium spike. They would vary by region, state, and carrier; areas with sicker, older people are likely to be hit harder, according to insurance officials. States that are doing well in terms of overall enrollment would be less likely to see hikes. At the same time, some companies apparently underpriced their plans last year with the intent of hiking them this year regardless, and others will keep prices low to stay competitive. State insurance departments may also limit how much insurers can raise prices.

More importantly, industry officials don't yet have enough information on their new customers. Jay Gruber and David Cutler, health policy experts who assisted with Obamacare, told The Hill they expect prices to rise — because they always do — but how much depends on how big insurers think the exchanges will be. Three bits of information will influence their perceptions:

How many people have enrolled in their plans and how old are they? How sick (or healthy!) are those enrollees? How much will the risk corridors pay out if the companies has too many sick enrollees?

The officials interviewed by The Hill said the industry is "pessimistic" when it comes to the surge of enrollments by young people that the administration predicts. Which makes this a little premature, since insurers won't know how many young people have enrolled in plans by March 31 until after March 31.

As CNBC found last week, insurance companies have been scrambling to figure out how sick their new customers are. “The insurance executives understand this is a brand new group of customers they know very little about,” Ceci Connolly, managing director of the Health Research Institute at PricewaterhouseCoopers, told CNBC (emphasis added). As The National Review explained:

[T]he health of the actual enrollees — and therefore what they cost insurers — is what’s going to determine whether predictions about the enrollees were accurate, which determines whether insurers lose a bunch of money on the exchanges this year, and whether they have to raise premiums a lot next year.

The Review argues that Obamacare makes it "woefully difficult" for insurers to find this out. Some insurers, like Wellpoint, predicted their enrollees would be older and won't be taking any big hits. If only 33 percent of enrollees are in the 18- to 34-year-old range, as the Kaiser Foundation found in December, insurers would have to raise premiums by one percent. If the enrollment rate stays at a lower 25 percent, it's hard to see how that would justify tripling premiums.

When the insurers do know how sick or healthy their customers are, they'll know if their estimates were right. If they have more healthy people than they predicted, they'll pay into the risk corridor program, a pool of money meant to keep insurers from having to raise rates. If they have too many sick people, they'll get paid by the system. (Federal health officials have limited how much the government can pay out to insurers.)###981||Empty###982||Empty###983||Empty###984||Empty###985||Walmart is one of the largest retailers of video games and video game consoles in the country. And now, they want a piece of that sweet pre-owned games pie that GameStop controls almost exclusively.

Beginning March 26, shoppers will be able to trade-in their used games at any Walmart or Sam’s Club store. Instead of cash, the retailer will offer a Walmart/Sam’s Club gift card in exchange for the games. The gift card won’t be limited to games and can be used on anything in the store or on the Walmart/Sam’s Club website. To be eligible for Walmart’s trade-in program, the games must be in playable condition and in their original box. And a Walmart employee will check them for “obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks” before trade-in credit will be issued.

So what does Walmart plan to do with all these used games? After the company takes possession of your games, they will be shipped off to a central processing facility where they will be resurfaced and repackaged. Afterwards, they will be sold in Walmart stores as “Certified Pre-Owned” titles. The process appears to be very similar to how Best Buy currently handles used games.###986||March 20 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Thursday that all but one of the 30 banks it subjected to its annual stress tests had sufficient capital to withstand a hypothetical economic crisis.

The widely watched investor confidence index calculated by the ZEW economic institute fell by 9.1 points to 46.6 points in March, its lowest level since August 2013, it said in a statement.

"In this month's survey, the Crimea crisis is weighing on experts' economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW president Clemens Fuest.

"Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk," Fuest said.

For the survey, ZEW questions analysts and institutional investors about their current assessment of the economic situation in Germany, as well as their expectations for the coming months.

The sub-index measuring financial market players' view of the current economic situation in Germany rose by 1.3 points to 51.3 points in March, its highest level since August 2011.

A frequent criticism of the ZEW index is that it can be volatile and is therefore not particularly reliable.###991||Print Article

In this Dec. 4, 2013, photo, Tracey Anderson, 26, re-stocks X-Box sets on opening day of a new Wal-Mart on Georgia Avenue Northwest in Washington.

NEW YORK - Wal-Mart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Wal-Mart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world's largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It's a business that's dominated by GameStop Corp., the world's biggest dedicated seller of video games, with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart's new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Wal-Mart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In an apparent flight on GameStop's program, Wal-Mart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

"When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its U.S. stores. "They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart's move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn't necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with "modest" success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

"History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share," he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits for itself.

But it's also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Wal-Mart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Wal-Mart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

"It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well," Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers."

Another potential challenge in the video game trade-in market is software makers' grudging acceptance of it. Publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have been adding downloadable content and add-ons to their $60 games to help recover any profits the publishers would have made if the consumer had bought a new game versus a retailer's $55 used version.

"You cannot have game and marketing budgets this high while also having used and rental games existing," Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of the popular "Gears of War" franchise, said last year###992||-

The market for used video games is in the neighborhood of $2 billion. It's way beyond folks selling on Craigslist. Big global retailers, like GameStop, make massive profits selling used games. The gaming retailer's profit margin on used products is nearly 50 percent, far more than it makes selling new games and consoles.

Now the largest retailer of all, Wal-Mart, is getting into the market. It's offering store credit for old games, which it'll eventually refurbish and sell.

Other big retailers have tried and failed to shake GameStop’s hold on the lucrative used gaming market. Wal-Mart brings substantial market power and a formidable advertising budget to the table. But even if it doesn't beat GameStop, offering trade-ins will get more people inside Wal-Mart. The retailer is betting gamers will buy other things after they trade in their used games.

Selling used video games may be great for some retailers, but game makers are left out of the profits on the secondary market. Some have made moves to try to stifle the used game market or at least elbow in on the profits. But gaming companies have consistently backed down when gamers have pushed back.

* U.S. Feb CPI up 0.1 pct, matches consensus estimate

* Yuan down against dollar and yen

* Yen benefits broadly, helped by Ukraine worries

By Daniel Bases

NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - A modest easing of geopolitical tension in Ukraine and a slight increase in U.S. Treasury yields took some premium away from the euro on Tuesday, sending it down against the U.S. dollar and the yen.

The Chinese yuan deepened its month of losses against the greenback on more signs of problems with a slowing economy and a heavily indebted corporate sector. The yuan’s weakness was seen as a benefit for the yen, helping lift it against the greenback.

Market strategists pointed to comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he did not plan to seize other regions of Ukraine as a signal the crisis may not deepen. Putin signed a treaty on Tuesday making Crimea part of Russia, defying Ukrainian protests and Western sanctions.

“Right now I am more inclined to treat this as intra-day noise,” said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. “As much as I do think geopolitics should be a bigger euro negative and bigger negative on Europe as exposures to Russia and Ukraine are much bigger, I don’t think the market is focusing on that. I think the market is focusing on the lack of escalation in the tensions.”

“I think the Crimea was a foregone conclusion and we have known that at least since the weekend. But I think the sanctions now are more rigorous or harder now than the sanctions that were put on Russia after they went into Georgia in 2008,” Chandler said.

The euro dipped 0.11 percent to $1.3904, having briefly broken down to $1.3891, but it essentially remained in a narrow trading range with a high on the day of $1.3941.

The crisis in Ukraine led to a sharp drop in Germany’s ZEW survey of investor and analyst sentiment, contributing to early losses for the euro.

The dollar fell to 101.51 yen, a loss of 0.25 percent against the Japanese currency.

There was little impact on markets from U.S. consumer inflation data, which showed a slight rise of 0.1 percent, a muted increase despite rising food prices.

“We see a significant risk off which is fading, linked to Ukraine, then we still have the worry of China, but it is not leading to contagion. It is receding,” said Sebastian Galy, senior currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York.

YUAN DROP

Reversing one of the past decade’s few sure bets in the foreign exchange market, the Chinese yuan is down around 2.5 percent in the past month. That move has resumed since officials widened the trading band for the currency over the weekend.

A survey of 970 global investors by Barclays showed that China’s problems have replaced the U.S. Federal Reserve’s reining in of monetary policy as the biggest concern for market players since the start of 2014.

“I’ve squared up now but I think there’s a risk that the yuan could go to 6.30-6.40 per dollar,” said Graham Davidson, a foreign exchange trader at Australian bank NAB in London.

“The yen will tend to gain against the dollar as the yuan weakens.”

The yuan weakened to 6.1795 to the dollar versus Monday’s close around 6.1580.

There are differing schools of thought on the fallout for Japan of a weaker yuan. On the one hand it allows Japan’s big manufacturers to invest more cheaply in producing cars and electronics in China, while the competitive advantage of those factories also grows. Profits can then flow back into Japan.

On the other hand, a generally weaker Chinese economy poses problems for Japan given China’s importance as a market for Japanese products and investment.

Dealers say that many of those who were betting strongly at the start of this year on further gains for the yuan are still to be shaken out, and that the currency could go much lower.

The main barrier to that is the People’s Bank of China itself, which has kept its reference rate for the yuan around 6.13 for a week, encouraging speculation it may defend the top end of its newly widened 2 percent band around 6.25 per dollar.

“If the top of the band is 6.25-6.27 they are not showing any great signs of wanting to let that go,” Davidson said.

The yuan - which is not fully convertible internationally and trades in a complicated system of “offshore” and Chinese “onshore” rates - was 0.5 percent lower against its Japanese counterpart at 16.4331.###998||Empty###999||ObamaCare and Health Insurance Premiums

That marks the first year that pay TV posted an annual loss according to media analytics firm Leichtman Research Group Inc. (LRG). Total subscribers for cable, satellite, and broadband systems numbered 94.6 million.

The LRG research notes that the top nine cable TV companies lost 1.735 million subscribers in 2013 compared to 1.41 million losses in 2012. These nine companies include Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ: CMCSA), Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE: TWX), Charter Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR), and Cablevision Corp. (NYSE: CVC). At the end of 2013 Comcast had 21.7 million subscribers, Time Warner had 11.4 million, Charter claimed 4.3 million, and Cablevision had 2.8 million. The proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner will create a behemoth with more than 34 million subscribers.

In 2013, Comcast lost 305,000 subscribers, Time Warner lost a whopping 825,000, Charter lost 121,000, and Cablevision lost 80,000. None of the nine largest cable operators gained subscribers over the 12 months.

Where are these cable viewers going? To AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), where the companies added a combined 1.46 million subscribers in 2013 and to the satellite providers DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV) and Dish Network Corp.

AT&T had 5.46 million subscribers to its U-verse broadband offering at the end of 2013 and Verizon had 5.26 million subscribers to its FiOS broadband product. DirecTV claimed 20.3 million subscribers at the end of 2013 and and Dish Network claimed 14.1 million.

According to LRG, cable providers now claim 52% of the pay TV market compared with 58% just three years ago. Comcast and Time Warner don’t fear any of their cable competitors, but the growth of broadband subscriptions does threaten what’s left of their monopoly markets. Getting bigger is their solution.

Source: Eastman Chemical Company Eastman Chemical Company Named as a 2014 World's Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere(R) Institute Eastman reaffirms its commitment to honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior

Kingsport, Tenn., USA, Mar 21, 2014 - (ACN Newswire) - Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) announced today that it has been recognized by the Ethisphere(R) Institute as a 2014 World's Most Ethical Company(R) for its efforts to continually raise the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior.



"Eastman is dedicated to conducting all business activities in accordance with the highest legal and ethical standards," stated David Golden, Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary for Eastman. "For nearly 100 years, business ethics have been top priority for Eastman. Ethics are critical to success because they build trust and confidence in our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities in which we work and live. Receiving this prestigious recognition further reinforces the commitment to honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior inherent in the Eastman culture."



Eastman has a number of policies and initiatives in place that allow its team members to cultivate a culture of the highest integrity and ethical standards. The company has an Office of Global Business Conduct, led by Eastman's Chief Legal Officer, which establishes the Code of Business Conduct. Globally, dedicated Eastman professionals are employed to support the company and its partners in doing business in the most ethical and compliant manner. The Code of Business Conduct outlines the laws, principles and guidelines all employees follow regarding honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior.



The company also has a third party Code of Conduct, called 'Doing Business with Eastman', which outlines the high ethical standards that Eastman expects of its business partners. Annual training on the Code of Business Conduct is required for all employees. Additionally, the 24-hour available Business Conduct Helpline provides an anonymous means for employees and business partners to report suspected violations.



World's Most Ethical Company honorees understand the correlation between ethics, reputation and daily interactions with their brand and that the award belongs as much to their associates as it does to them. Eastman is one of only three companies in the global chemical industry honored this year.



"The entire community of World's Most Ethical Companies believe that customers, employees, investors and regulators place a high premium on trust and that ethics and good governance are key in earning it," said Ethisphere's Chief Executive Officer, Timothy Erblich. "Eastman joins an exclusive community committed to driving performance through leading business practices. We congratulate everyone at Eastman for this extraordinary achievement."



The World's Most Ethical Company assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient(TM) framework. The Ethics Quotient framework has been developed over years of effort to provide a means to assess an organization's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. The information collected provides a comprehensive sampling of definitive criteria of core competencies, rather than all aspects of corporate governance, risk, sustainability, compliance and ethics. The Ethics Quotient framework and methodology was determined, vetted and refined by the expert advice and insights gleaned from Ethisphere's network of thought leaders and from the World's Most Ethical Company Methodology Advisory Panel.



Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (25%), reputation, leadership and innovation (20%), governance (10%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (25%) and culture of ethics (20%).

###1002||As Prime Minister Stephen Harper landed in the Netherlands ahead of a visit to Ukraine to meet with the country’s interim government this weekend, he announced a fresh expansion of sanctions against Russia.

Harper issued a statement Friday afternoon as he landed at The Hague announcing that Canada has imposed economic sanctions on 14 more Russian officials as well as Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based bank owned by supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Travel bans have also been imposed on the 14 individuals.

“Together with our international allies, our government is taking a strong stance in our support for Ukraine. We continue to take additional actions to limit the capabilities of specific individuals and Bank Rossiya, which are responsible for undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty,” said Harper in the statement.

Friday’s announcement brings the total number of Ukrainian and Russian officials sanctioned by Canada to 41. The officials have been sanctioned for their connection to the invasion of Crimea nearly three weeks ago and orchestration of Sunday’s referendum that saw Crimeans vote for independence from Ukraine.

Bank Rossiya is the first financial institution to be sanctioned by Canada.

The punishments are part of Canada’s efforts to isolate Putin and his government. In addition to economic sanctions and travel bans, Canada has also broken military ties with Russia.

Along with its G7 partners, Canada has refused to recognize last weekend’s referendum in Crimea.

“The so-called referendum that was held has no legitimacy, and any additional escalations by Russia will lead to further isolation from the international community,” said Harper in the statement.

On Friday, NDP Foreign Affairs critic Paul Dewar called on the government to suspend military sales to Russia, following a similar move by Germany earlier this week. It is not known whether the Conservative government is on side with this idea.

Harper is the first G7 leader to visit the eastern European country since pro-Russian troops invaded Crimea. He will meet with Interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Saturday. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird will also accompany the prime minister.

Following his visit to Ukraine, Harper will return to The Hague for the Nuclear Security Summit and an emergency meeting between G7 leaders. He will complete his trip with a visit to Germany, where he will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss a variety of bilateral issues.

The newly targeted individuals on Canada’s sanctions list are as follows:

– Andrei Alexandrovich Fursenko, Putin aide;

– Alexei Gromov, first deputy head of presidential administration;

– Sergei Ivanov, chief of staff to the presidential executive office;

– Victor Petrovich Ivanov, member of the Russian security council;

– Vladimir Igorevich Kozhin, Putin’s head of administration;

– Yuri Valentinovich Kovalchuk, largest single shareholder of Bank Rossiya and personal banker to senior officials;

– Sergey Yevgenyevich Naryshkin, chairman of the government Duma of the federal gathering of the Russian Federation;

– Lt.-Gen. Igor Dmitrievich Sergun, general staff chief of military intelligence

– Yury Viktorovich Ushakov, Putin foreign policy adviser;

– Vladimir Pligin, chairman of the Duma constitutional law committee;

– Arkadii Viktorovich Bakhin, first deputy defence minister;

– Mikhail Vitalevich Margelov, chairman of the federation council committee for foreign affairs;

– Vitalii Nikitich Ignatenko, first deputy chairman of the federation council committee for foreign affairs;

– Gennady Timchenko, one of the founders of the Gunvor, a major commodity trading company.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," the company said in a statement.

"We remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5 per cent organic revenue growth and better-than 30 per cent non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

The language of the statement leaves little doubt about the extent of the exasperation of the board with Bennett. His position was "terminated," and he has been forced to resign his board position within the company. This compares with more moderate language when Symantec fired the last CEO Enrique Salem

Bennett's replacement, for the moment at least, is former chairman of the Symantec board Michael Brown. He is resigning his position on Symantec's Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee as part of the move.

"With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan," said the new boss.

"The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market. By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage Symantec's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."

That last sentence shows part of the reason why Bennett was so abruptly fired. The past few years have not been happy ones for Symantec, with serious job losses at both the executive level and among the workers that have improved profitability figures, even though sales have remained fairly static.

The search will now start for a new CEO to take up the chalice of leadership of the troubled security and storage giant. Sadly for the company, John Thompson, arguably Symantec's most successful CEO, has his hands full as chairman of Microsoft's board and is not available for new "opportunities." ®

Sponsored: Following Bottomline’s journey to the Hybrid Cloud###1005||Bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said it found 200,000 bitcoins, which were previously thought stolen, in disused electronic wallets. Another 650,000 bitcoins remain unaccounted for.

The Tokyo-based company said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that the 200,000 bitcoins were identified Mar. 7 after "old format" wallets were searched as part of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumors of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $120 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.

###1006||Antivirus and security software provider Symantec Corp fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett on Thursday, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years, as the company struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales.

Shares of the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, fell 10 percent in extended trading.

Symantec said it appointed board member Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The decision to let go of Bennett was “the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,” the company said.

“It’s a jaw-dropping move, especially because Bennett was key to the company’s turnaround. I view this as a major step back …,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland said Symantec had been losing market share to nimbler network security software makers such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Checkpoint Systems Inc.

Symantec said it was committed to its target of more than 5 percent organic growth and higher than 30 percent adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2017.

However, BMO Capital analyst Joel Fishbein said it would be difficult for Symantec to achieve 5 percent revenue growth without mergers and acquisitions or divestiture due to a continuing fall in its main PC security and storage businesses.

Symantec, whose security products usually come bundled with PCs, reported in January a 5 percent decline in revenue for the third quarter ended December 27.

Bennett had said the fall in revenue was partly due to changes in the structure of the company’s sales team.

Symantec had been reorganizing its sales force to create specialists for each product group instead of having everyone sell everything.

Bennett, a former CEO of financial software maker Intuit Corp, was appointed by President Obama to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee in July.

“Over the last decade, there have been a lot of head scratching moves at Symantec from strategy to acquisitions and you can just add this to the list,” Ives said.

Symantec unexpectedly ousted CEO Enrique Salem in 2012 even as a strategic review was under way to turn around the company. (http://r.reuters.com/jur77v)

A special committee of the board will immediately begin a search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive search firm, the company said.

Symantec also reaffirmed its earnings and revenue forecast for current quarter ending March 2014.

The Mountain View, California-based company’s shares closed at $20.90 on Thursday on the Nasdaq.

A website that offers homes for rent is understood to be embarking on a fundraising that could value it at $10 billion — more than some of the established hotel chains it competes against.

The new money would catapult Airbnb into the ranks of the world’s most valuable start-ups, along with the likes of WhatsApp, which was snapped up last month by Facebook for $19 billion, and Dropbox, the online storage provider that was recently valued at $10 billion.

Airbnb operates by putting travellers seeking a place to stay in contact with people with a house or room to rent.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin’s inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin’s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin’s lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 per cent in midday trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 per cent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

Though customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or even withdraw cash from ATMs, the clients can get cash directly from the banks.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country’s central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to “take the bank’s clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them,” according to the Interfax news agency.

Describing Rossiya, which was rumoured to serve nearly everyone in Putin’s close entourage, as “just an average bank,” Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one “first thing on Monday” and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia’s central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.”

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.###1013||Report: Couch surfing site in the process of raising $400-$500 million, valuing it at around $10 billion.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the startup is in the process of starting a new fundraising round worth $400 million to $500 million.

The company hasn't disclosed revenue or profitability. According to its site, there are more than 600,000 listings worldwide.

The United States on Friday hit out at Turkey''s banning of the online social network Twitter and urged Ankara to restore access to what it called "basic communication tools."

WASHINGTON - The United States on Friday hit out at Turkey's banning of the online social network Twitter and urged Ankara to restore access to what it called "basic communication tools."

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said an order to prevent Turks from accessing the US firm's micro-blogging site was "contrary to Turkey's own expressed desire to be a model of democracy."

"The United States supports freedom of expression in Turkey and opposes any action to encroach on the right to free speech," she told reporters.

"We urge the Turkish government to unblock its citizens' access to Twitter and ensure free access to all social media platforms."

The White House said it was "deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens' access to basic communication tools."

Washington has conveyed its concerns to the Turkish government and supports "the people of Turkey in their calls to restore full access to the blocked technologies," White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.

Psaki added she was not aware of any moves by the US administration to play a role in negotiations between Twitter and the Turkish government.

But she stressed that "democratic governments must accept the challenge to... listen to the voices who disagree with us."

"An independent and unfettered media is an essential element of democratic, open societies and crucial to ensuring official transparency and accountability," Psaki added.

Russia retaliated for US sanctions today but it's unclear if that was in retaliation for the first round of sanctions or the second round. The individual sanctions are a joke but sanctions against a bank could have some real effects. The loser is Bank Rossiya, which is the fifth-largest in Russia and has assets of about $10 billion (but only 1% of customer deposits). If Russia decides to respond in equal measure, what's the fifth-largest bank in the US? Goldman Sachs. Of course, Goldman's assets are an order of magnitude larger and they actually do business in Russia but I'm sure a few US bank executives in Russia are feeling stressed.###1018||Representatives from the European Parliament and EU governments were reported to have reached a preliminary deal Thursday on what's meant to be another crucial element of the bloc's banking union to emerge in heeding a lesson form the global financial crisis.

After 16 hours of talks in Brussels, negotiators said there had been a breakthrough, but details were not immediately available with the heads of the political factions in parliament overwhelmingly supporting the deal.

The EU's Market Commissioner, Michel Barnier, said the bank-wind down scheme "might not be a perfect construction" but would help to "put an end to the era of massive bailouts."

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble described the compromise as a mechanism to effectively control rescue funding and to minimize the risk to taxpayers. Schäuble also said that the participation of stakeholders in a bank rescue, known as bail-in, as well as completion of a bank rescue fund within 8 rather than 10 years were the most important issues.

Clear-cut modalities of how to wind down failing banks had been seen as a vital contribution to shielding taxpayers from the financial consequences of lenders' bailouts in future and an important instrument to restore trust in the single-currency system.

Who will foot the bill?

A major bone of contention had been determining who would have the power to close or restructure troubled banks and who would have to pay how much into a joint pot to pay for any winding-down procedures. The common fund was expected to swell to 55 billion euros ($76 billion) within the next eight years.

Negotiators had been under pressure to reach an agreement before European elections in May or else risk delaying the matter until 2015. The final opportunity for parliament to approve any accord is at its three-day session starting April 14.

A common bank wind-down mechanism is widely considered as important as the upcoming banking supervision by the European Central Bank (ECB) from November of this year, following a thorough check of the eurozone lenders' health and core capital.

Emails: Separate multiple email addresses with semi-colon Your Email: Send email to me as well Subject: Comments: 200 character limit.

MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged his support on Friday for Bank Rossiya, a lender hit by U.S. sanctions which mainly serves clients in Russia's energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom.

The bank and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin's close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is also one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world's largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients, mainly in the oil and gas sector. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom's businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

"Our companies will continue using the services of the bank," a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following the sanctions.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, instructed the Russian central bank to aid Bank Rossiya, if needed.

"And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand it is a medium-sized bank," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday."

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

The Russian central bank said the measures imposed by the United States would have no significant impact on the financial stability of Bank Rossiya.

"If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors," it said in a statement.

St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya, the country's 15th largest in terms of assets, is chaired by Kovalchuk, a close adviser to the president. The friendship between the two men dates back to the early 1990s.

According to the bank's most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank's corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

This downgrade comes amid news that Symantec's board of directors has terminated CEO Steve Bennett. According to Ashley, although the board has reiterated its support of Bennett's plan to reach organic revenue growth of five percent and >30 percent EBIT margins by 2017, they did not believe this plan was "transpiring as quickly as hoped."

The Tokyo-based company has misplaced around 850,000 Bitcoins, owned by both its customers and the company itself. The exchange is investigating the discovery, which gives some cause for optimism from those who had given up all hope of getting their stash back.

Mt.Gox began allowing users to check their balances last week, a positive turn after rumors of its struggles came true when it imploded and disappeared offline last month. Things are still definitely less than rosy for the company however, it filed for bankruptcy last week.

Mt. Gox, the embattled Japanese Bitcoin exchange that was hacked and filed for bankruptcy last month, said Thursday it found 200,000 Bitcoins held in an "old format wallet." CEO Mark Karpeles issued a statement on the Mt. Gox website claiming that the digital wallet was found while researching wallets used before June 2011.The wallet accounts for 24 percent of the total holdings the company had when the site crashed, losing more than $450 million in total value. At today's rates, the found coins are worth about $114 million. According to CNN Money, when the company filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo and the U.S. it filed with debts totaling $64 million.The company says it reported the finding to the bankruptcy court March 10, and had moved the bitcoins to offline, or "cold," storage by March 15.The new development is likely to cause a flare-up among the customers whose money has been lost since the crash. Mt. Gox was one of the biggest exchanges in the world when it stopped customers from withdrawing money, blaming the disruption on technical troubles and cyber attacks.Investors hold out little hope they will get their money back, as Japan had not regulated the exchange, and no deposit insurance was offered.Several other exchanges and Bitcoin banks sought to reassure their own investors and account holders after the crash, among them the U.S.-based Coinbase, which has more than 1 million consumer wallets.In a joint industry statement, the founders of Coinbase wrote, "As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today. ... We are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfill the promise that bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the Internet age."Mt.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Wal-Mart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Wal-Mart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Wal-Mart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and ipad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” said Mac Naughton.

Beginning on March 26, Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores will accept used console video games for credit that can be used toward groceries, tech, and other products.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,’’ said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US, in a statement.

While stores like GameStop and Best Buy have trade-in policies for video games and other tech, Wal-Mart is among the first to offer credit for unrelated products. Shoppers can use credit to make purchases in-store and online.

Traded-in games will be refurbished and sold later this year, according to Reuters.###1028||The Colorado Court of Appeals issued a surprising ruling last week applying Amendment 64 retroactively to a 2011 marijuana conviction, which it threw out.

The case is important not because of the particular reversal, since the public obviously doesn’t want people punished for possessing small amounts of marijuana. Nor is the decision likely to clog the courts with thousands of demands for reversals, since the defendant’s case was unusual in that it was on appeal when Amendment 64 was approved.

But the retroactive application of the amendment is disturbing — and it’s good to see state Attorney General John Suthers saying he’s going to appeal the ruling.

As the court itself noted, “when construing a constitutional amendment, unless its terms clearly show intent that the amendment be retroactively applied, ‘we presume the amendment has prospective application only.’ ” Amendment 64 had no retroactive provision. But the court reasoned that state statute and doctrine established by the Supreme Court allow “a defendant to benefit retroactively from a significant change in the law.” And there’s no doubt Amendment 64 changed law.

Suthers counters that “well-established retroactivity law in Colorado indicates that statutory changes are prospective only unless the General Assembly or the voters have clearly indicated” otherwise.

And he worries about “the implications this ruling may have on other non-marijuana cases.”

Indeed, lawmakers could become reluctant to make major adjustments in the criminal code if they will have a cascading effect on those previously convicted.

By the way, the actual prosecution of the defendant, Brandi Jessica Russell, was hardly a miscarriage of justice. She tested for amphetamine, marijuana and methamphetamine after she and her husband took an injured baby to the hospital and the doctor grew suspicious. And the appeals court did uphold her conviction on possession of meth.###1029||Updated from 10:18 a.m. to include thoughts from MKM Partners analyst.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Oracle (ORCL) shares rose after the software, services and cloud computing giant reported third-quarter results that missed results.

For the third quarter, Oracle earned 68 cents a share on $9.3 billion, coming in below what analysts were expecting. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting 70 cents a share on $9.36 billion. The company did note in its press release that currency fluctuations impacted earnings by 3 cents a share, with 2 cents coming from the wild swings in Venezuela.

"In constant currency, our Cloud Software Subscriptions revenues grew 25% and our Engineered Systems revenue grew more than 30% in the quarter," said Oracle President and CFO Safra Catz in the press release. "Oracle Cloud Applications and Engineered Systems are both rapidly growing, billion dollar run-rate businesses. Those two high-growth businesses helped us deliver record year-to-date operating cash flow, and a record $15 billion of operating cash flow over the past twelve months."

Shares were higher in Wednesday trading, having reversed course from earlier in the session, gaining 0.12% to $38.91.



WATCH: Oracle Presents Trading Opportunity on Earnings Dip

CEO Larry Ellison lauded the company's hardware portfolio, noting Exadata and SPARC SuperClusters had over a 30% constant currency growth rate during the quarter. "Our Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our Cloud Applications business is growing rapidly. In both cases, customers want us to integrate the hardware and software and make it work together, so they don't have to."

During the company's conference call, Oracle said it expects revenue to rise between 3% and 7% during the quarter, with earnings per share expected to be between 92 cents and 99 cents. Analysts are expecting 96 cents.

Following the results and the call, analysts were largely positive on the name, noting that the cloud portfolio seems to be turning around, as the company heads into its seasonally strong fourth quarter. Here's what a few analysts had to say.

UBS analyst Brent Thill (Buy, $42 PT)

"ORCL is still searching for a breakout after 10 straight Qs of sub 5% rev growth. ORCL's three main businesses (database, apps and middleware) have been pressured by agile competitors and ORCL's late transition to the cloud, which is now well underway and is masking some of the reported growth. Now that some of these issues are being addressed more proactively by ORCL, we should start to see top line growth reaccelerate, especially as we enter ORCL's seasonally strong FQ4. $42PT."

JPMorgan analyst John DiFucci (Overweight)

"ORCL reported F3Q results that were about in line with estimates, with hardware products slightly better than expectations and software license & cloud a bit shy. We continue to believe that while ORCL is seeing secular pressure in its applications business, concerns about its most important (and most profitable) business, infrastructure software, are overblown."

Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis (Buy, $43 PT)

"For now, we will continue with our BUY rating on Oracle because the stock is sufficiently inexpensive to serve as ballast in your typical software portfolio, full of high flier money losers which can face random and rapid loss of faith by investors. That said, incrementally at least, we inched closer to a downgrade to Hold on ORCL, particularly if it appears that the firm will continue to report low end of the range results against truly easy comparisons. For now, Oracle remains a tepid BUY."

Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead (Buy, $45 PT)

"ORCL's F3Q14 numbers came in slightly below estimates, with total revs of $9.3b (+4% y/y, +6% in c/c, +4% c/c excluding acquisitions) vs. estimates of $9.36b and software license and subscription revs of $2.4b (+4% y/y, +6% in c/c) lower than expectations of $2.47b, offset by solid hardware revenues of $725m (+10% c/c and above expectations). However, the results were in-line with guidance and the mid-point of the F4Q14 revs growth guidance (of 5%) was in-line with estimates. Geographically, license sales in the Americas were up a solid 9% while Asia-Pac was down 3%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 was lower than estimates of $0.70, but was $0.71 making all FX adjustments."

Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan (Buy, $44 PT)

"Cloud bookings on a 12 month basis grew 60%+ (Fusion apps grew triple digits), and 30%+ organic, including 65 seven or eight figure deals. Organic CC software revenues grew 2%+ y/y. Engineered systems grew 30%+ y/y and organic hardware revenues grew +3% CC y/y. Hardware has turned the corner and is finally growing on an organic basis, which should help accelerate the topline. Middleware grew double digits. Renewal rates hit a 4-year high. We previously noted that the 12c database product cycle is coming up (see details on pg 4). Tech license growth rates have not benefitted yet from the introduction of 12c, which should be an incrementally positive driver going forward."

Jefferies analyst Ross MacMillan (Hold, $37 PT)

"ORCL's F3Q14 results were largely in line with expectations, with some puts ($0.02 currency devaluation impact) and takes (continued strong HW, lower than expected tax rate). While Cloud bookings improvement is positive, we still don't see anything in results/guidance that argues strongly for a change in our view at this point. We maintain our Hold."

MKM Partners analyst Israel Hernandez (Buy, $41 PT)

"We reiterate our Buy rating and $41 12-month price target following 3Q results. While software sales were a little light, we believe investors are likely to look past the quarter given accelerating cloud applications momentum, an improving hardware business and a solidly in-line 4Q outlook. We are buyers on any weakness this morning into seasonally strong 4Q and a multiyear 12c database cycle in front of us."

The online room-rental service Airbnb is reportedly close to securing a new round of funding that would value the company at $10bn – making it worth more than several leading hotel chains.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the San Francisco-based company is in advanced talks to raise between $400m and $500m with private-equity firm TPG. At $10bn, Airbnb would be one of the world’s most valuable startups and worth more than than Hyatt Hotels ($8.3bn) or Wyndham Worldwide ($9.4bn).



Founded in 2008, Airbnb allows individuals to rent out rooms, apartments and homes for short stays. The company is arguably the world’s largest hotel company, having helped set up more than 10m stays in 550,000 rooms in 34,000 cities. It added nearly 250,000 properties to its service in 2013.

Airbnb’s popularity has attracted the ire of hotel chains who claim the service allows renters to dodge lodging taxes and that the company should be regulated in the same way that they are.

New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Airbnb last October demanding information on its 15,000 hosts in the state. New York state law prohibits renters from subletting their homes for less than 30 days if the host is not present. The challenge came after Airbnb had pledged to work with the state to collect occupancy taxes and root out bad actors. The company is contesting the order, arguing it is unreasonably broad.

Airbnb’s valuation has quadrupled since it last raised money in 2012 at a price that valued it at $2.5bn from investors including PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Ashton Kutcher is another of the company’s early backers.

The company is part of the so-called “sharing economy” that has shaken up the taxi industry as well as the hotel industry with services like Uber and Lyft that allow people to use their own cars to freelance as part-time taxi drivers. Uber is valued at $3.8bn, following an investment last year by Google Ventures, TPG and others.###1031||Empty###1032||On Friday the Salt Lake City-headquartered Zions Bancorporation (ZION) was found to have insufficient reserves to cover themselves in the event of financial catastrophe, failing a stress test administered by the Federal Reserve. Zions will be forced to shore up their reserves, shed their riskiest loans, and resubmit for approval.

These stress tests are designed to prevent another meltdown like the one the occurred in 2008 from ever again happening. The Federal Reserve’s stress tests however, which are conducted on every major and regional lender in the US, have to strike a tricky balance.

On one hand, the Fed can’t fail too many banks at once or get too byzantine with their punishments. They can’t just close the bank outright, leaving thousands of depositors in limbo. They also can’t flunk too many banks at once or they could threaten to jumpstart a panic.

At the same time the Fed cannot be too lenient in their stress tests. If they start rubber-stamping banks to try to avoid freaking out the populace, stress tests become purposeless.

So what happens to Zions after they fail the test? They are given a couple months to fix the problems by getting the riskiest mortgages off their books. They strengthen their reserves. And if they fail again, they can have their credit rating slashed, digging them further down the hole.

This is where Zion finds themselves. And it looks bad – of 30 major banks tested, they were the only ones to fail. But while they have failed the Fed’s stress test, they are getting a second chance. They will be continued to allow to operate even if they continually fail, which will certainly hurt them going forward and could make their situation dire, no matter what the macro conditions are.

Zion operates under the name Zion in Utah and Cal Bank and Trust in California. They have some $55 billion in assets and currently have a market cap of $5.84 billion.

By midday trading on Friday shares of Zions had fallen 4.30 percent to hit $31.57 a share.

ISTANBUL

The number of Turkish tweets rose 33 percent after the blocking of Twitter, according to Somera.

The number of active Twitter users, as well as tweets posted, has soared since the Turkish government blocked access to the popular social media platform.Access to Twitter was blocked at 23:00 on March 20. However, according to figures published by social media rating agency Somera , over 6 million Turks tweeted from March 20, 23:00, to March 21, 12:00. Only 4.5 million tweets were sent the previous day in the same time slot, when there was no blocking. The difference corresponds to a 33 percent rise.The number of actively tweeting Turkish users has also risen by 17 percent, from 1.49 million to 1.75 million comparing the same periods. Turkish activity on Twitter had been 16 percent lower than the previous day just before the block. However, as soon as access was blocked it rose sharply, and it remained hitting record highs even at 03:00 a.m., as seen in the graph:Most users therefore seem to have got around the access ban and entered Twitter via VPN tunnels.The ban comes on the heels of damaging revelations following the corruption probe and the successive release of phone conversations of government officials, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Some observers have interpreted the decision to ban Twitter as an attempt to prevent further damaging leaks ahead of the March 30 local polls. However, Erdoğan said the government undertook such measure “for the sake of its citizens.” “I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic’s state,” he added.###1034||The Federal Reserve on Friday released the results of this year’s annual Dodd-Frank Act stress test (DFAST), which evaluates the capital of the country’s top 30 banks and measures their ability to continue lending during an economic downturn. The scenario analytics tests were designed to determine if the financial institutions would be able to withstand dire conditions such as a severe drop in housing prices, 11.25 percent unemployment, as well as equity prices overall dwindling by half.

As expected, 29 of the 30 banks tested passed the first round of the Fed’s annual examination of their financial health and stability. These marks were awarded despite this year’s significant new changes that made the rigorous process more complex than in the past. For the first time, 12 medium-sized banks were evaluated along with the larger institutions, as well as the introduction of the Fed’s “severely adverse” and litigation scenarios to determine whether the top six banks (JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs) could handle extreme domestic and international situations.

While the Fed speculated that the banks overall would lose $501 billion if faced with a severe recession and $355 billion in a less dire situation, they also concluded that the system overall is healthier and better equipped to handle a catastrophe than it was five years ago, when testing began. The only institution to fail the DFAST was Zions Bancorporation of Salt Lake City, falling below the 5 percent minimum Tier 1 threshold at 3.5 percent.

This was not a surprise, as the lender had already indicated that it would be resubmitting its 2014 capital plan for evaluation. All the other banks that were examined exceeded the Fed’s standards, paving the way to allow the institutions to pay back investors. Of the large banks, the top performers were New York Mellon and State Street, while the lowest ranked were Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Bank of America. Bank of America had the worst outcome of the large banks, just passing at 6 percent.

The results announced Friday were the first of two reports that will be released this month, with the more uncertain Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) outcomes expected March 26. While high marks on the DFAST signifies a bank’s ability to stay afloat, the CCAR evaluates each bank’s capital plan and its ability to be both profitable and maintain dividends during an uncertain economic outlook.

Each bank’s CCAR standards are individualized according to the institution’s balance sheet, risks, and assets, as well as its ability to pay excess capital to investors under the same adverse scenarios as put forth in the DFAST. Only after passing both tests will the Fed permit the banks to pay their investors almost $75 billion of excess capital in the form of dividend and buybacks that have accrued since 2009. Needless to say, it’s the CCAR results that the market is anticipating more.

Although Friday’s news held no surprises, next week’s results are somewhat more uncertain. There will be a greater focus on the lowest-ranking institutions, especially JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which each had to resubmit their capital plans last year. Insiders will also be paying attention to Citi’s CCAR results due to its low marks, at 7 percent, as well as February’s discovery of $360 million lost due to receivables fraud by a Mexican subsidiary, which forced Citi to resubmit its fourth-quarter financials.

The Labor Department says the unemployment rate rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 per cent from 4.2 per cent.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell.

Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs that month, below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

This is a second Symantec CEO that has been fired in less than two years.

Via the Wall Street Journal:

Mr. Bennett had been CEO since July 2012, when he replaced Enrique Salem. A former General Electric Co. executive and Intuit Inc. chief executive, Mr. Bennett had initially joined Symantec as chairman. He aimed to retool Symantec to compete with a new generation of cybersecurity companies. But Mr. Bennett, 60 years old, couldn’t reverse falling revenues and hadn’t yet delivered on new products, former employees and a person close to the board said.

SYMC board member Michael Brown will take over as interim CEO until a replacement is found, the company said.

The computer security company that is known for its anti-virus software work has suffered declining revenue in recent months — down for the last two quarters.

At the end of December, Symantec revenue fell 4.8% to $1.7 billion though income rose 31%, in large part due to the company’s cost cutting.

Symantec said revenue in the current quarter would be $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion, down from $1.75 billion last year.

SYMC stock is down 12% in early morning trading, but had been down 15% from last year prior to the news.###1037||Empty###1038||New, economically viable deposits of lithium, nickel, cobalt and other metals required for lithium-ion batteries have never been so greatly in demand, notes Kris Kottmeier of The Venture Letter.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

Today I will deliver a Budget for a resilient economy - starting with a resilient pound coin pic.twitter.com/Ev2IuNpXg4 — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) March 19, 2014

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit".

But Labour's Cathy Jamieson poured scorn on the announcement: "I think people are going to be worried about how many pounds they’ve got in their pocket, rather than the shape of it," she said.

The new one pound coin 1/ 4











Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the "heads" side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

But many have already taken to Twitter to voice their scepticism surrounding the release of the new coin – with some speculating that it is a distraction as the Chancellor announces his Budget.###1040||Walmart Used Game Trade-Ins Announced By Pete Haas Random Article Blend

The site also lets you browse the trade values for several recent releases.The retailer dipped their toe in used game sales back in 2009 with special trade-in kiosks . They discontinued that program within a year, though apparently never lost their appetite for the pre-owned market. It's no surprise, given the size of that market. In a new infographic trailer, the company states that there are nearly a billion games collecting dust in American homes."Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., today. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want." GameStop has made a tidy profit over the years through buying used games and then selling them at a marked-up price. Walmart's entry into the market should make things interesting for customers. It's possible we could see better trade-in values for used games as the two retailers compete for gamers' business.The second phase of Walmart's plan will begin later this year when they start selling used games. These "Certified Pre-Owned" games will be available through Walmart.com as well as stores.Walmart customers are currently able to trade in smartphones and tablets toward the purchase of a new device in stores or online.

Back to top###1041||About 5 million people overall had enrolled in ACA plans as of March 17, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).



Critics have suggested most of them had insurance before, but had to buy new plans because their old ones were not compliant with the new law.



The Obama administration has touted a recent Gallup poll that found the rate of uninsured Americans dropping to 15.2 percent in February—the lowest rate since 2008.



But McKinsey, a leading management consulting firm, polled about 2,100 exchange-eligible Americans in February, and found only 27 percent of people who had picked a plan were previously uninsured. Only 53 percent of them had paid their first premium, compared with 86 percent of the previously insured. With 5 million total enrollments, that would be about 715,500 previously uninsured Americans who had chosen and paid for new insurance.



It's also been hard to get a handle on how many previously uninsured people have gained coverage through Medicaid expansion in the states that chose to offer it.



The House Energy and Commerce Committee has held numerous hearings on the Obamacare implementation. Chairman Fred Upton has been a vocal critic.



"It's bad enough that the administration has repeatedly moved the goalposts and attempted to redefine what success means for the president's health care law. But the fact that they are deliberately avoiding the threshold measurement of how many of the law's new enrollees were previously uninsured begs the question: what was the goal?" the Michigan Republican said in a statement to CNBC.###1042||Colorado clarified its marijuana packaging requirements Monday, extending to medical pot the same restrictions in place for recreational pot.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, who signed the bill into law, called it an important clarification to make sure minors don’t illegally access marijuana.

“Marijuana should not be easily accessible or attractive to kids,” Hickenlooper said.

The new law requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

Most medical marijuana sold commercially already complies with existing recreational packaging standards.

The new law also gives marijuana shops the same authority that liquor stores have to confiscate fraudulent IDs from underage consumers. It passed unanimously in both chambers of the legislature.

“Everyone came together on this,” said Rep. Daniel Kagan, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the law.

Dr. George Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency room physician at Children’s Hospital Colorado, joined the bill signing and said there’s anecdotal evidence of emergency rooms seeing more cases of youth marijuana overdoses.

But Wang said there’s not enough data to draw conclusions on the effect of recreational pot, and that more study is needed.

“We’ve only been experiencing this for a couple of years,” Wang said.

Another new law signed Monday allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already completes state-level background checks.###1043||There are several points of consideration that will affect a premium spike. They would vary by region, state, and carrier; areas with sicker, older people are likely to be hit harder, according to insurance officials. States that are doing well in terms of overall enrollment would be less likely to see hikes. At the same time, some companies apparently underpriced their plans last year with the intent of hiking them this year regardless, and others will keep prices low to stay competitive. State insurance departments may also limit how much insurers can raise prices.

More importantly, industry officials don't yet have enough information on their new customers. Jay Gruber and David Cutler, health policy experts who assisted with Obamacare, told The Hill they expect prices to rise — because they always do — but how much depends on how big insurers think the exchanges will be. Three bits of information will influence their perceptions:

How many people have enrolled in their plans and how old are they? How sick (or healthy!) are those enrollees? How much will the risk corridors pay out if the companies has too many sick enrollees?

The officials interviewed by The Hill said the industry is "pessimistic" when it comes to the surge of enrollments by young people that the administration predicts. Which makes this a little premature, since insurers won't know how many young people have enrolled in plans by March 31 until after March 31.

As CNBC found last week, insurance companies have been scrambling to figure out how sick their new customers are. “The insurance executives understand this is a brand new group of customers they know very little about,” Ceci Connolly, managing director of the Health Research Institute at PricewaterhouseCoopers, told CNBC (emphasis added). As The National Review explained:

[T]he health of the actual enrollees — and therefore what they cost insurers — is what’s going to determine whether predictions about the enrollees were accurate, which determines whether insurers lose a bunch of money on the exchanges this year, and whether they have to raise premiums a lot next year.

The Review argues that Obamacare makes it "woefully difficult" for insurers to find this out. Some insurers, like Wellpoint, predicted their enrollees would be older and won't be taking any big hits. If only 33 percent of enrollees are in the 18- to 34-year-old range, as the Kaiser Foundation found in December, insurers would have to raise premiums by one percent. If the enrollment rate stays at a lower 25 percent, it's hard to see how that would justify tripling premiums.

When the insurers do know how sick or healthy their customers are, they'll know if their estimates were right. If they have more healthy people than they predicted, they'll pay into the risk corridor program, a pool of money meant to keep insurers from having to raise rates. If they have too many sick people, they'll get paid by the system. (Federal health officials have limited how much the government can pay out to insurers.)###1044||Malaysia Airlines MH370: Search for missing plane shifts north after French satellite spots debris

Updated

The hunt for debris from Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 off the coast of Western Australia shifted north today, as Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said Australia was "clutching at whatever little piece of information comes along" in the search for the missing plane.

The shift to an area some 850 kilometres north of the weekend's search zone came after French satellites spotted "floating debris" in the ocean.

Speaking to Radio National this morning, Mr Truss said the overall search area had now been extended to cover 68,000 square kilometres.

"Certainly the areas where debris has been picked up by satellites is of particular interest, and they're the focus of a lot of the searching," Mr Truss said.

"The French sighting is a piece of new material because that is in a completely different location. That is about 850 kilometres north of our current search area.

"So we need to check that out as well."

Malaysia's transport ministry said the French images showed "floating debris" and said they had been sent to Australian authorities coordinating the search.

But Malaysia gave no details of the number, size or precise location of the objects.

Mr Truss said the debris in the French images was not in an area authorities had identified as the most likely place where the aircraft may have entered the sea.

"We still don't know for certain that the aircraft is even in this area," he said.

"We are just clutching at whatever little piece of information comes along to try and find a place where we might be able to concentrate the efforts."

He also said Tropical Cyclone Gillian, near Christmas Island, could bring bad weather south, hindering search efforts.

"It is a very difficult task. The weather yesterday wasn't too bad, although there was early morning fog," he said.

"Today we expect the weather to deteriorate and of course the forecasts ahead are not all that good.

"So it's going to be a challenge but we'll stick at it."

The pilot of one of the Royal Australia Air Force Orions involved in the search said conditions had been challenging.

Flight Lieutenant Russell Adams said there had been heavy cloud cover and his crew was not able to spot any debris.

"We're working directly with Rescue Coordination Centre Australia as one small cog in this giant effort," he said.

"We're going out there for two, three hours at a time, so the satellite imagery is going through the centre and we've been tasked appropriately through them.

"As per the effort that my crew's putting in we couldn't be more proud of the boys and girls."

No sign of debris in challenging search conditions

Flight MH370 went missing on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard, including six Australians.

Authorities last night completed a fourth day of sorties into the search zone, where they are now also searching for an object that China identified yesterday as being 22 metres long and 13 metres wide.

The object was spotted about 120 kilometres south-west of two possible objects seen on satellite images taken on March 16 and announced by the Australian Government on Thursday.

The Chinese satellite images were taken on March 18 by the high-definition Earth observation satellite Gaofen-1.

Eight aircraft were involved in yesterday's search and the Royal Australian Navy's HMAS Success was also in the area.

Chinese and Japanese military aircraft are due to arrive in Perth today to help.

Australian Air Force Commander Craig Heap says it is fantastic to have two Japanese P3 Orion planes helping with the operation.

"We have worked many times with the JMSDF (Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force) over the years, especially the P3 crews," he said.

"They are highly professional and they'll bring a tremendous capability to this operation.

"They bring a P3 which is an extended range, specifically designed for maritime patrol.

"They're also extremely professional aviators."

On Saturday, a civilian plane reported sighting a number of small objects close together in the search zone.

A P3 Orion aircraft flew over the area but could see nothing but seaweed.

The Orion dropped a marker buoy to track movement of the material and a merchant ship has been sent to locate and identify it.

Speaking from Papua New Guinea yesterday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said one of the objects was reported to have been a wooden pallet.

"Obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads and there is increasing hope, no more than hope, that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen," he said.

Malaysia has enlisted 25 other countries to help hunt for the plane.

DENVER -- Two bills signed into law Monday aim to protect Colorado children from recreational marijuana.

"Keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids should be a priority for all of us," said Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, before signing the bills into law. "Every neuroscientist I've talked to has talked about the possibility this could have long-term effects on a child's brain."

One proposal seeks to reduce the number of accidental ingestions of edible marijuana by young children who, for instance, confuse pot brownies for candy; and it also looks to limit the ability of older children to purchase recreational marijuana using a fake ID.

House Bill 1122, which requires all edible marijuana to be sold in opaque, child-proof packaging and also empowers pot retailers to confiscate suspected fake IDs like liquor store owners can, passed both the House and Senate unanimously.

"We had the marijuana industry, we had the medical profession, we had law enforcement, we had Republicans, we had Democrats all come together to say 'how can we fix these problems?'" said Rep. Daniel Kagan, D-Denver, the bill's House sponsor.

The proposal also specifies that marijuana that is grown in a home with people under 21 must be enclosed and locked.

"We have seen increased visits to the ER and urgent care clinics because kids are accidentally ingesting marijuana," said Sen. Linda Newell, D-Littleton, the senate sponsor.

"This new law goes a long way to ensuring that we’re taking steps to keep kids safe."

The new laws take effect immediately.###1046||There is a major election next week, and the PM has been linked to a massive corruption probe in the nation.

The settlement, which isn’t final, could be announced as early as Wednesday in the U.S. and will be for $1.2 billion, said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the agreement isn’t public.

The carmaker recalled more than 10 million vehicles for problems related to unintended acceleration in 2009 and 2010, starting with a September 2009 announcement that it was recalling 3.8 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles because of a defect that might cause floor mats to jam accelerator pedals. The company later recalled vehicles over defects involving the pedals themselves.

In addition to the criminal probe by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office and the New York office of Federal Bureau of Investigation, the recalls led to lawsuits claiming that defects harmed the value of Toyota vehicles or caused accidents leading to death and injury. Toyota settled suits brought by car owners who claimed economic losses for about $1.6 billion.

Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, declined to comment on the settlement. Kelly Langmesser, a spokeswoman for the FBI in New York, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on it.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Steve Curtis, a Toyota spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

Curtis declined to comment on a possible settlement.

Three top Democrats in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives yesterday requested Gilead Sciences CEO John C. Martin Ph.D. give them “a briefing” on the pricing of the company’s new chronic Hepatitis C virus treatment Sovaldi™ (sofosbuvir) 400 mg tablets, complaining about “the extraordinary high cost of your drug.”

“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the three Democrats said in a letter to Dr. Martin. The three are Henry A. Waxman (D-CA), ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce; Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), ranking member of the panel’s Subcommittee on Health; and Diana DeGette (D-CO), ranking member of the committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

They cited news reports that Gilead plans to charge $84,000 per 12-week treatment for Sovaldi, which won FDA approval in December after six months. That cost could nearly double when Sovaldi is combined with other drugs, the House Democrats said.

“These costs are likely to be too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and those with private insurance,” Reps. Waxman, Pallone and DeGette wrote.

Gilead has noted that the cost of the drug is lower than the cost of complications associated with hepatitis C treatment, such as liver damage or liver failure: “In our conversations with payers, pricing is a consideration, but efficacy, safety and treatment guidelines are equally important,” Gilead COO John Milligan told Bloomberg in January.

Sovaldi is a once-daily oral nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor designed to block a specific protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate. Sovaldi is the first drug that has shown the safety and efficacy to treat certain types of HCV infection without the need for injection of interferon at the same time.

Sovaldi won FDA’s priority review and breakthrough therapy designations, granted to investigational medicines deemed to offer major advances in treatment over existing options.

“It is our hope that Sovaldi will mark the beginning of a new era in hepatitis C treatment,” Dr. Martin declared at the time in a statement.



























###1053||Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.

What: Shares of Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) slumped nearly 13% Friday after the company announced the termination of CEO Steve Bennett.

So what: Bennett will be temporarily replaced by board member Michael Brown as Symantec searches for a permanent CEO. The move also follows yet another painful quarter in which Symantec saw revenue fall 5% year over year amid sluggish PC sales and a drastic sales force restructuring. Bennett insisted at the time, "While we won't be happy until total business activity is growing again, I'm happy with our financial results given the massive changes in our business."

Bennett served in his post for roughly a year-and-a-half after replacing Symantec's then-CEO of three years, Enrique Salem.

Now what: Though board chairman Daniel Schulman recognized Bennett's actions as "establishing a solid foundation for Symantec's future," he stated, "Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth."

So what's an investor to do? Even with shares down 23% year to date, I'm sticking by my previous stance of patiently watching from the sidelines. Symantec shares may look cheap trading below 10 times next year's expected earnings, but I have little interest diving into the stock of a faltering business until we receive more clarity on its future direction.###1054||This comes as the Kremlin consolidates its hold on Crimea, which it begrudgingly considered Ukrainian soil only as far as Tuesday — lessons in democracy coming out of Moscow.

Moving swiftly after Crimeans voted in a referendum to join Russia, President Vladimir Putin said: “Our Western partners, led by the US, prefer to practice their politics guided not by international law, but the law of the strong. They have come to believe that they are exceptionally qualified and empowered to resolve the fates of the world. They bring power to bear against sovereign states and build coalitions based on the principle ‘whoever’s not with us is against us.’”

An annexation treaty Putin signed with pro-Russian Crimean leaders says the autonomous territory will be fully integrated into Russia after a transition period.

Kyiv, Brussels and Washington twitched.

At least, that’s how jubilant Muscovites and their politicians interpreted Western expressions of outrage over the move and a first phase of sanctions. The powerful in Moscow scoffed at the measures.

In contrast, in the biggest crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War, US President Barack Obama sought to present his Russian counterpart’s move as motivated by impotence at home — troops in Crimea or not.

Obama said: “The truth is that Mr. Putin acted out of weakness, not out of strength. We are not going to be getting into a military excursion in Ukraine. What we are going to do is mobilise all of our diplomatic resources to make sure that we’ve got a strong international coalition that sends a clear message, which is that Ukrainians should decide their own destiny.”

Russia accuses the new pro-Western authorities in Kiev of endangering Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. It says it will insist that its compatriots’ rights and freedoms be fully respected.

Warning of the risks that could come with a weak response to Moscow’s absorption of Crimea, Washington foreign policy pundits Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft have been analysing Putin’s justification of his moves against Ukraine. Both Americans are former US National Security Advisors.

At a conference at the Center for Strategic & International Studies think tank in Washington, DC, they said a surprisingly efficient annexation of Crimea ends a quarter of a century of constructive relations between Russia and the United States.

According to Brzezinski: “We have to convey to the Russians our concern that those words spoken by Putin are terribly reminiscent of what Hitler was saying about Austria before the Anschluss [the occupation and annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938], which was then followed by the Sudetenland [areas of other countries inhabited mostly by German speakers], and we know the rest of the history. And that could be very serious in Europe. Either we can be passive in the face of a calamitous explosion or maybe the Ukrainians will fall apart and simply there will be a repetition of what happened in Crimea.”

In Scowcroft’s opinion: “Putin is a different person, a very different person from Gorbatchev or even from Khrushchev, and he has the outlook of someone who was KGB and who saw the Soviet Union collapse. He is a person full of venom, because he thought that that collapse was taken advantage of by the West, especially by the United States, to humiliate Russia or take advantage of Russia.”

Neither Scowcroft nor Brzezinski see Europe’s new insecurity as a return to the Cold War; they see it in a different context of 21st century reality.

Brzezinski: “Putin has to consider: can he really undertake a war at this stage in the heart Europe given the state of his economy, which is really very bad, and the relatively retarded state of his military, which is only now being modernised? If he did this ten years from now, he might be in much better shape. But right now, I don’t think a serious conflict in that part of Europe is something that Putin would welcome. He would like to have a quickie: either the break-up of Ukraine or some upheaval within Ukraine. And I think we have to reassure him in a constructive fashion that that is somewhat unlikely, because we have interests too.”

Scowcroft said Putin’s action could have been averted if the West had paid attention to Urkaine’s economy, but, he said, both the US and Europe have been lazy about the whole thing.

Scowcroft: “The EU made an offer for a relationship with Ukraine. It didn’t amount to anything. Putin turns around and offers a 15 billion dollar loan. What the United States could have done at that time and I think should have done is to say, look, Ukraine’s economy is in terrible shape, let’s us, the United States, the EU and Russia put together a programme of assistance to Ukraine.”

Our correspondent Stefan Grobe asked Brzezinski if the initial sanctions taken against Russia are enough.

Brzezinski answered: “Well, they [the sanctions] are like the introductory phase of a dinner, just a little bit of a preliminary bite, but not too much bite.

Grobe: “Do you expect more?”

Brzezinski: “Yes.”

Grobe concludes: “The foreign policy establishment in Washington is deeply troubled by Putin’s action and by the Western response. The hope is that President Obama and the European allies at the EU summit in Europe next week will find a more muscular approach.”###1055||Empty###1056||Daily Events Top

When liberal pro-Obama scholars question the legality of President Barack Obama’s actions to implement Obamacare, the issue of illegal presidential use of power moves from partisan to frightening.

George Washington Law School’s Jonathan Turley is the second most quoted law professor in the nation and a two-time Obama voter. He recently testified before Congress on Obama’s extensive use of executive orders and administrative actions to make unilateral changes in Obamacare, immigration policy, minimum wage and the IRS qualifying standards for non-profit status.

As to Obamacare, Obama, so far, changed it in at least a dozen major ways, including, but not limited to, postponing the employer mandate, allowing insurance carriers to let their insured keep an old policy, and, more recently, redefining the Obamacare “hardship” exemption so broadly as to nullify the individual mandate for at least two more years.

Was this legal?

Turley said: “President Obama has repeatedly violated this (separation of powers) doctrine in the circumvention of Congress in areas ranging from health care to immigration law to environmental law. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis with sweeping implications for our system of government. … ” We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system.”

Turley challenged Congress to re-assert its authority. “If balance is to be reestablished,” he said, “it must begin before this President leaves office, and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. No one in our system can ‘go it alone’ — not Congress, not the courts, and not the President.”

Obama sold Obamacare with many now-broken promises. Saving costs was a big one. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office set the net cost of Obamacare at $599 billion over 10 years — citing a gross cost of $848 billion less $249 billion in tax revenues and other cost savings. But recently the CBO revised the 10-year price tag to more than $2 trillion.

Economist Jonathan Gruber, the father of Romneycare — which was the template for Obamacare — recently admitted that well, no, costs will not be going down. “Covering people with health insurance doesn’t save money,” said Gruber. “That was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn’t designed to save money. It’s designed to improve health, and that’s going to cost money.”

So, Obamacare won’t save money, but at least those too poor to afford health insurance will now lead healthier lives, right? Not necessarily.

Oregon expanded its Medicaid program years ago — the way Obamacare does now — to include some of Oregon’s low-income uninsured. Because of costs, Oregon did this on a random lottery basis. Some got it, some, unfortunately, wanted to but couldn’t. But this allows comparisons. Oregon, for example, can now compare the health outcomes of the now-insured Oregonians against those who wanted to get insurance, but couldn’t. Surely, the now-insured are healthier compared to those without health insurance.

But there were no significant differences in their health care outcomes. While the newly insured did increase their doctor visits for preventative and primary-care services, some could not get appointments with doctors, many of whom wouldn’t take new Medicaid patients. Emergency room use went up 40 percent among the new Medicaid patients, not down — all for non-emergency medical needs. Forbes health care researcher Avik Roy writes, “The result calls into question the $450 billion a year we spend on Medicaid, and the fact that Obamacare throws 11 million more Americans into this broken program.”

Worse, the uninsured dislike Obamacare even more than do those with health insurance. A recent Kaiser Health poll found that among the uninsured, only 22 percent have a favorable attitude toward Obamacare, a far-lower percentage than the 56 percent of uninsured who are unfavorable toward Obamacare.

Before Obama became president, he said if he were “starting from scratch,” he’d go with a single-payer system. A few months ago, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid was asked whether Obamacare would lead us to single-payer. Reid said, “Absolutely.” This is the real plan.

Single-payer is universal healthcare system used in Canada. It remains popular. But in 2009, the incoming president of the Canadian Medical Association said: “(Canadian doctors) all agree that the system is imploding. We all agree that things are more precarious than perhaps Canadians realize.” What did the outgoing CMA president propose? He said: “A health care revolution has passed us by” and “competition should be welcomed, not feared.” So while the Canadian Medical Association urges more competition and privatization, America moves toward even more government involvement in health care.

In the annual index of countries rated on “economic freedom,” the United States — since 2008 — has slipped from the No. 5 position to No. 12. Canada — at No. 6 — is now more “economically free” than the United States! Economic freedom and prosperity go hand in hand.

Yet this administration makes it clear it is more interested in wealth re-distribution and less interested in wealth creation. President Obama is quite adept at the former — clueless about how to achieve the latter.

The deal protects Toyota executives from criminal prosecution



Justice Department lawyers investigated whether Toyota misled investigators looking into its handling of complaints of acceleration issues

General Motors currently is being investigated over similar complaints

Toyota and the federal government reportedly are about to announce a settlement to the tune of $1 billion following a Justice Department probe of how the automaker handled customer complaints about unintended acceleration the company at one point attributed to faulty floor mats.

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office began investigating allegations that the Japanese automaker misled federal authorities in 2009, after complaints about the unintended acceleration became a source of controversy.

The agreement allows Toyota to avoid any potential criminal charges that could be brought against employees in the future, and requires the company to shell out a $1 billion fine.



Unintended acceleration: Toyota initially tried to resolve the issues with the cheap fix of replacing floor mats

Deal: U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has slapped Toyota with a $1 billion fine for its handling of acceleration issues in some of its most popular vehicles

The agreement was first reported by CNN.

'Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years,' a Toyota spokeswoman told the cable news network. 'During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.'

Bharara's office and the Justice Department declined to comment on what for now is only a planned announcement.

For years, Toyota responded to complaints about acceleration issues in some of its most popular models by doing little more than changing floor mats.



Recall: Toyota was forced in 2009 to issue a massive recall of some of its most popular vehicles

In 2009-10, the car company was forced to recall millions of vehicles after it became clear that floor mats were not the main cause of the many cases of unintended acceleration problems.



In addition to Toyota, motor vehicle regulators were criticized for how they responded to the acceleration issues the company was having leading up to the massive recall.



Following the recall, Toyota executives were forced to appear in two Congressional hearings, at which lawmakers criticized their response to complaints regarding acceleration issues with some of the company's top-selling models.



Next: Bharara also is investigating similar claims made against General Motors

In addition to the agreement with the Justice Department, Toyota has agreed to similar settlements with state governments, as well as car owners.

The settlement with Toyota comes as the Justice Department begins a probe into safety issues with General Motors vehicles.

All but one of the 30 largest banks are now strong enough to weather another severe economic crash, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

In the newest of the series of health examinations mandated after the 2008 financial crisis, only Zions Bancorp could not measure up to a basic capital standard in a theoretical drastic meltdown of the economy.

Twenty-nine bank holding companies held up in the worst-case scenario with a cumulative 7.8 percent Tier 1 common ratio, a basic measure of capital strength, down from 11.5 percent at the end of the third quarter last year, but ending well above the 5.0 percent minimum target.

That represented a steady strengthening of the sector since the tests began three years ago,

Salt Lake City, Utah-based Zions Bancorp was the only one which fell below the threshold, finishing the year-long period of the theoretical meltdown with just a 3.5 percent tier 1 common ratio — the level of shareholder equity and reserves.

It takes the form of a twelve-sided coin and bears a strong resemblance to the three pence piece, or ‘threepenny bit’, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971.

A public design competition will determine what the reverse, or ‘tails’ side of the coin looks like.

Although the coin is not expected to be introduced until 2017, a prototoype has been produced as a template for what The Royal Mint says will be ‘the most secure circulating coin in the world to date.’

The finished coin will be made of two different coloured metals and contain what The Royal Mint calls an Integrated Secure Identification System.

iSIS has been developed by The Royal Mint’s in-house technology team ‘and involves the application of an existing security technology that has been proven over decades in banknotes,’ says the Mint, which claims that this is a first for coins.

A public consultation will be held over the summer focussing on the impact of the coin before specifications and metal composition are decided on.

The Royal Mint will also work with key stakeholders to understand the impact on industry.

George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer says, ‘After thirty years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

‘With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.’###1060||Empty###1061||Empty###1062||Empty###1063||Norfolk, VA (23510)

In fact, several major retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Amazon have made attempts to capture a piece of the used video games market in the past,” said Bhatia in a note this morning.While Wal-Mart seems pretty determined to get this $2 billion a year business, Bhatia has the perspective to judge a threat.Some retailers have made multiple attempts over the years including Best Buy, but none have had much success, he said.It's understandable, that retailers who sell new games want to also sell used games, Bhatia said. "However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”GameStop’s large refurbishment facility in Grapevine, pricing algorithms and experience developed over the last decade and its Power-Up Reward membership are some of the advantages it has over others, Bhatia said.Here's my take on it: Wal-Mart's customers are struggling and the company has commented on the effect of lower SNAP benefits on its shoppers and the company's performance. If Wal-Mart shoppers can find some extra cash from abandoned video games to buy anything in the store, then Wal-Mart may get a lift from the buyback program that starts next week.Warning to you kiddos out there: Hide your video games if mom says she's short on grocery money this week!###1066||CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

The Treasury believes that around three per cent - amounting to a total of £45m - of pound coins are fake.

To combat the problem a new 12-sided pound coin will be introduced in 2017.

But until then how can you tell if your pound coins are genuine or fake?

Key signs of a fake are:

- Quality. A genuine coin will have sharp, clearly defined markings of the Queen's head or the picture on the flip side.

- Alignment. The Queen's head and the picture on the flip side should line up, as in the image above. They are often askew on fake coins.

- Design. The design on the reverse of the coin corresponds with a specific year of production. A list of the correct designs can be found here

- Colour. If the colour does not match the usual colour of most pound coins it is likely to be fake, or if on old coin shows no sign of ageing it could be fake.

- Milled edge. Uneven depth in the lettering or spacing is a sign of a fake.###1074||Empty###1075||Unemployment rates have fallen in 43 US states as more Americans begin looking for work and most quickly find jobs.

The Labor Department says the unemployment rate in January rose in just one state - Iowa - where the rate increased to 4.3 per cent from 4.2 per cent. That's far below the national rate of 6.6 per cent that month.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27 said that the number of jobs fell. Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs that month, below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate, at 9.2 per cent, while North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 2.6 per cent.###1076||Empty###1077||Empty###1078||New York, March 21, 2014--Turkey banned access to the social media platform Twitter on Friday, hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan threatened in a public speech to shut it down, according to news reports. The move comes just ahead of March 30 elections and follows Erdoğan's threats to ban Facebook and YouTube.

"Prime Minister Erdoğan can keep stepping up his attacks on social media, but they only serve to show that he is afraid of the message and desperate to shoot the messenger," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said. "We call on Turkish authorities to restore access to Twitter and to substantiate their claims to democracy by allowing all information to flow freely."

At a campaign rally on Thursday in the western city of Bursa, Erdoğan claimed that a court order justified banning Twitter, according to press reports. The Turkish telecommunications regulator BTK said today that Internet service providers had been ordered to block access to Twitter after several users filed legal complaints in early March about violation of their privacy on the social networking site. BTK said the measure was intended to prevent the possible "victimization of citizens."

"Any court in any country would implement this kind of decision whenever it notices an attack against people's privacy rights," the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç as saying.

But the English-language Turkish daily Hürriyet Daily News reported today that the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court told the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) that Twitter had been blocked as a result of an "executive decision, not a judicial verdict." TBB had filed a petition with the court requesting that the ban be lifted, the report said.

Twitter is a popular platform for Turkish whistleblowers, who in recent months have shared numerous recordings--allegedly of Erdoğan and his aides--that implicate top-ranking authorities of corruption, abuse of power, and other wrongdoing. Anonymous Twitter accounts have recently said that particularly sensitive recordings were going to be made available on the Twitter on March 25, a few days before the elections, news reports said.

"The rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech are all the more crucial in the run-up to elections," CPJ's Ognianova said.

The blocking of Twitter has already been overcome by many Turkish Twitter users, including Turkish President Abdullah Gül, who called the Twitter ban unacceptable. He said in a tweet: "There is no way that closing down social media platforms can be approved."

As a sign that the blocking did not have much effect on Twitter traffic, the hashtag #TwitterIsBlockedInTurkey began trending from within the country a few hours after the ban was announced. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission who is also in charge of the European Union's digital agenda, called Turkey's ban "groundless, pointless, cowardly."###1079||Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) today made available the results of the company's 2014 Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test on the Bank of America Investor Relations website at http://investor.bankofamerica.com under Events and Presentations.

Bank of America's estimates assume no changes to the company's current common share dividends (and contractually obligated payments on other regulatory capital instruments) and include the common stock repurchases previously disclosed for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test requirements. These estimates should not be regarded as forecasts of actual financial results for either Bank of America or its selected subsidiaries.

These results are estimates and may not reflect the actual impacts to Bank of America if such a hypothetical scenario were to occur. Importantly, in certain instances, methodologies required by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency differ from Bank of America's internal practices; therefore, the results may not reflect actions that Bank of America would likely employ under such stressed conditions. Investors in securities issued by Bank of America should not rely on the Stress Test results as being indicative of expected future results.###1080||{ }

MOSCOW (AP) - Russian stocks were under pressure Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks, a day after the U.S. ordered economic sanctions against two dozen people from President Vladimir Putin's entourage.

Fears over Russia's economic outlook have ratcheted up this week as the country annexed Crimea following Sunday's hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate and has slapped on sanctions in response.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin's inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support. Putin's chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin's lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned.

The MICEX benchmark was down 2 percent in late afternoon trading Friday with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were feeling the heat, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury's sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia's 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a "personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation."

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that their bank cards are not as useful as they were. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services "without prior notification." SMP's co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg - billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin - were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia's top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard's actions as "illegitimate" because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

As a result, customers in the two banks won't be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops online or withdraw cash from ATMs beyond their own bank's. They can also get cash directly inside their banks' branches.

President Putin on Friday ordered the country's central bank to help clients of Rossiya. He denied having an account there but ordered the Central Bank to "take the bank's clients under protection and provide all possible assistance to them."

Describing Rossiya, which was rumored to serve nearly everyone in Putin's close entourage, as "just an average bank," Putin said he had never had an account there, but promised to open one "first thing on Monday" and asked his salary to be transferred there.

Russia's central bank earlier said that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. "does not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability."

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor's in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia's debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia's economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia's BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country's borrowing costs more expensive.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov lambasted the move, saying it was not an objective decision and that somebody "ordered" it.

"Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support," Fitch said.

{ }###1081||As the age of video games ages, so do the number of discarded and unused video games, probably. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), the world’s largest retailer, means to take advantage of that via a video game trade-in program. Since Walmart is among the store chains that sells video games and consoles, the decision almost certainly will add to the revenue from this business.

The company announced:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

The plan, therefore, allows Walmart to sell the refurbished games at a discount to new ones, which could bring in a new group of customers who need or want to pay less for their gaming.

The consumer’s effort to take part is easy:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com.

About 3,100 Walmart stores will participate.

Walmart is taking a last bite at an aging industry, which may not exist in its current form just years from now. The success of consoles made primarily by Sony Corp.’s (NYSE: SNE) PS4, Microsoft Corp.’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) Xbox One and Nintendo have been undermined by the rise of the tablet and smartphone. And traditional video games have been replaced to some extent by ones that can be downloaded from app stores, primarily those controlled by Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Some company has to take advantage of the end of an era. It might as well be Walmart, which has the customers, stores and online base to do so.###1082||Are you getting the best rate from your broker?

STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.

----------------------

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates SYMANTEC CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate SYMANTEC CORP (SYMC) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the S&P 500 and greatly outperformed compared to the Software industry average. The net income increased by 31.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $216.00 million to $283.00 million.

SYMANTEC CORP has improved earnings per share by 33.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, SYMANTEC CORP reported lower earnings of $1.05 versus $1.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.86 versus $1.05).

The gross profit margin for SYMANTEC CORP is currently very high, coming in at 88.15%. Regardless of SYMC's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 16.59% trails the industry average.

SYMC, with its decline in revenue, underperformed when compared the industry average of 10.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.8%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share.

( ) reached a new 52-week low today after the company said it has fired president and CEO Steve Bennett from his role, after less than two years on the job, and has appointed board member Michael Brown as interim chief, effectively immediately.

Bennett's axing follows earnings disappointments, share losses and a series of executive departures last autumn. Bennett also resigned from the board of directors.

The company said it would immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the help of an executive recruitment firm.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to , including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," said chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement late Thursday announcing the news.

"These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for 's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17."

Schulman said the company's priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage the company's assets and team to drive the next stage of 's growth.

He highlighted that the termination was not "precipitated by any event or impropriety."

Interim CEO Brown joined the company's board following its merger with Veritas Software in July 2005, and previously served as chairman and chief executive of Quantum Corp during a time when that company doubled in revenues to $6 billion.

"The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market," said Brown in the release.

"By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage 's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."

also reiterated its guidance for the fourth quarter, previously announced in January. It said it expects revenue of $1.615 to $1.655 billion, compared to $1.748 billion in the year-ago period, on adjusted earnings per share between 40 and 42 cents, down from 44 cents.

Shares of the company were lately down 12.75% to C$18.25, sinking to as low as $17.95 earlier in the session.###1086||###1087||Empty###1088||Empty###1089||Colorado clarified its marijuana packaging requirements Monday, extending to medical pot the same restrictions in place for recreational pot.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, who signed the bill into law, called it an important clarification to make sure minors don’t illegally access marijuana.

“Marijuana should not be easily accessible or attractive to kids,” Hickenlooper said.

The new law requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

Most medical marijuana sold commercially already complies with existing recreational packaging standards.

The new law also gives marijuana shops the same authority that liquor stores have to confiscate fraudulent IDs from underage consumers. It passed unanimously in both chambers of the legislature.

“Everyone came together on this,” said Rep. Daniel Kagan, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the law.

Dr. George Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency room physician at Children’s Hospital Colorado, joined the bill signing and said there’s anecdotal evidence of emergency rooms seeing more cases of youth marijuana overdoses.

But Wang said there’s not enough data to draw conclusions on the effect of recreational pot, and that more study is needed.

“We’ve only been experiencing this for a couple of years,” Wang said.

Another new law signed Monday allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already completes state-level background checks.###1090||Walmart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors.

RUSSIA TO HOLD OFF ON RECIPROCAL SANCTIONS

Earlier on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would for now hold off on more reciprocal sanctions against the United States, after Washington introduced punitive measures against his close allies over the Ukraine crisis.

"You know, both in the first case -- the American sanctions -- and in the second case -- the introduction of a visa regime with Ukraine -- I think we should for now hold off on reciprocal steps," Putin told a meeting of his Security Council in comments released by the Kremlin.###1097||New, economically viable deposits of lithium, nickel, cobalt and other metals required for lithium-ion batteries have never been so greatly in demand, notes Kris Kottmeier of The Venture Letter.

Bennett, who took previous chief Enrique Salem's job in July 2012, vowed to streamline operations, prune midmanagement’s ranks and reframe the company around a more succinct mobility and security lineup. He apparently took the hit for Symantec’s sliding revenue, sagging share price and sluggish delivery of new products. In addition to handing over his titles, Bennett also resigned his position on the board.

As a side note, Salem now is a member of Symantec rival FireEye’s (FEYE) board of directors. FireEye is among a growing number of younger security vendors challenging Symantec’s conventional approach, aiming instead at intrusion detection and prevention.

Symantec said it has appointed a special committee of the board to collaborate with an executive search firm to find Bennett’s successor.

Board chairman Daniel Schulman said Bennett’s firing did not result from any one event or behavior but stemmed from what he termed “an ongoing deliberative process,” in which he was found lacking on product innovation and growth.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” said Schulman. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5 percent organic revenue growth and better-than 30 percent non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.”

Symantec’s revenue fell 4.8 percent to $1.7 billion for the quarter ending Dec. 27. In tandem with announcing Bennett’s departure, Symantec said it expects sales in the current quarter will slide from $1.75 billion a year ago to between $1.62 billion and $1.66 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected between 29 cents and 31 cents, as compared to 27 cents in the year-ago period.

Brown, who joined Symantec's board in 2005 following the Veritas merger, said he will focus on product innovation and growth.

"With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan,” he said.

“The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market,” Brown said. "By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage Symantec's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."

On Bennett’s watch, Symantec last April rolled out Symantec 4.0, its new customer-focused sales strategy with an increased emphasis on channel partners. Under the revamped sales model, field reps are incented to work with channel partners with more resources invested in business development activities and enablement.

Justin Moore, Axcient chief executive, defended Bennett’s performance at Symantec’s helm.

“When Bennett announced his vision for Symantec 4.0, which was announced less than a year ago, he made the right choices—for the most part,” Moore said in an email. “Yet, Symantec was already too far behind the cloud/SaaS curve to catch up. A change of this magnitude is impossible in less than three to five years.”

Moore said Symantec’s problems extend beyond Bennett’s control. “Like so many other enterprise software companies, it has struggled to transition to the enterprise cloud world proving that it is indeed a systemic issue that goes far beyond Bennett's control.”###1100||The euro traded little changed against the Swiss franc on Tuesday before the ZEW Institute publishes data regarding economic sentiment in Germany and the Euro zone as a whole.

EUR/CHF slipped to a daily low at 1.2150 at 7:50 GMT, after which consolidation followed at 1.2153, down a mere 0.02% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 17th low, 1.2133, while resistance was to be encountered at March 13th high, 1.2168.

The gauge of economic sentiment for Germany probably slowed down to a reading of 51.8 in March, according to the median estimate by experts. Last month the index came in at a value of 55.7.

The index of economic sentiment for the Euro zone probably fell to 67.3 this month from 68.5 in February. The official results from the monthly survey by the ZEW (Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung) are to be announced at 10:00 GMT today.

Meanwhile, yesterday the annualized rate of consumer inflation in the single currency zone was reported to have weakened in February, which may put pressure on the European Central Bank to introduce new measures in order to spur economic growth.

The annualized HICP came in at 0.7% last month, a level last seen during October 2013, which was still far below central bank’s inflation objective of 2%, that provides price stability. Experts had anticipated that the annual inflation rate will remain steady at 0.8% in February.

On the other hand, safe haven demand for the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc was likely to be heightened, as Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that he supported a request from Ukraine’s breakaway region of Crimea to join the Russian Federation, regardless of the imposed sanctions by the United States and the European Union.###1101||Technology employed to protect banknotes from counterfeiters has been introduced into a prototype £1 coin by The Royal Mint.

Integrated Secure Identification Systems (iSIS) is the result of R&D from engineers at The Royal Mint that has so far seen £2m of investment into a coin that will have ‘covert’ security embedded into it for the first time.

Launched in May 2013, iSIS is said to give coins three tiers of ‘banknote-strength security’ that can be authenticated through high-speed automated detection. A survey undertaken in November 2013 found that the rate of counterfeit UK £1 coins in circulation at the time had risen from 2.74 per cent to 3.04 per cent, and the Royal Mint add that a new level of detection in vending machines will also be possible too, thereby removing this method of introducing fake coins.

Expected to be introduced in 2017, the new 12-sided coin will be constructed from two different – but as yet unspecified – coloured metals.

According to Royal Mint, iSIS is expected to reduce costs by replacing expensive clad and homogeneous coins with a more affordable full-plated option rather than a surface coating that is prone to wear over time.

In a statement Adam Lawrence, chief executive of The Royal Mint said: ‘We are already known as the world’s leading export mint, but iSIS confirms our place as leaders within our industry, as we continue to expand the boundaries of minting technology.’

A public consultation will be held over the summer before a final decision is made on the precise specification of the new coin.###1102||JavaScript is disabled in your browser.

Not only is it facing growing competition from its own suppliers, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE), but soon it will have to take on the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).

While Wal-Mart has been selling video games (both hardware and software) for years, the discount chain is about to challenge GameStop in an entirely new way: Later this month, Wal-Mart will begin dealing in used video games. While I wouldn't expect Wal-Mart's new initiative to obliterate GameStop's business overnight, it's only increasing the pressure on a retailer that's becoming less relevant by the day.

The looming threat of digital distribution

GameStop is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the S&P 500, with a short float near 30%. While different investors may be working from different theses, the larger case against GameStop primarily centers around the promise of digital distribution.

It's no secret that the video game industry is going digital. Like movies and music before them, video games are increasingly shifting from physical discs to digital downloads. Owners of Microsoft's and Sony's latest consoles, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, can, if they so desire, deal exclusively in digital -- downloading all of their games directly from the companies' respective digital storefronts, something that couldn't be done with prior machines.

But there are still many reasons that gamers would prefer to own a physical copy, and so physical games live on for the time being. Some gamers lack the robust broadband connections required for large game downloads, while others may prefer to have a physical copy that they could sell or lend to a friend. These obstacles cannot be overlooked, but should be overcome in time.

For their part, both Microsoft and Sony are working hard to encourage gamers to embrace digital distribution. Microsoft has begun to offer aggressive discounts on digital versions of its games, a strategy that allowed Valve to dominate the PC gaming space. Sony has similar "flash" sales, but has taken it a step further.

This summer, Sony's "PlayStation Now" service will roll out to owners of its PlayStation 4 video game console, allowing them to stream digital versions of games directly over the Internet. It remains to be seen if the service will be successful, but if it catches on, it will pose an obvious threat, particularly if Sony can expand PlayStation Now to include newer titles.

While most sell-side analysts continue to downplay the threat posed by digital distribution, some of them have begun to come around. Last month, Longbow Research downgraded GameStop to underperform, citing the risks posed by digital distribution.

Wal-Mart comes after GameStop's core market

With its suppliers in open rebellion, GameStop's problems are about to intensify. Whatever market remains for used video games in the coming years, GameStop will have to share it with Wal-Mart. GameStop has a number of advantages over Wal-Mart -- a smaller, more focused operation; more knowledgeable employees; and its PowerUp Rewards program -- but Wal-Mart has advantages of its own.

Namely, Wal-Mart plans to offer traders general store credit -- meaning that a pile of old video games could be traded for a cart of groceries, a tank of gas, a new TV, or any of the tens of thousands of items Wal-Mart stocks. In contrast, video games traded in to GameStop can only become more games, video game-related hardware, or used mobile devices. (Admittedly, GameStop will pay cash, but far less than what it pays in credit.)

Given that used video game products account for about one-quarter of GameStop's revenue and almost half of its profit, Wal-Mart's entrance into the space cannot be discounted. Either GameStop will lose market share or it will be forced to work harder to retain its market, sacrificing margins in the process.###1106||



The move could cut costs for consumers, as prices climb ever higher for new titles. But the retail giant's entry into the business poses a serious competitive threat to leading used games vendor GameStop ( GME ), along with many mom-and-pop game shops around the U.S. Big video-game publishers are also likely grumble about more lost dollars to the second-hand market.





Walmart said early Tuesday that it will begin dealing in used video games on March 26, initially focusing on titles for the PlayStation, Xbox and Wii systems. The company says the used video-game market is worth $2 billion. It could be even more lucrative if people would sell more the 880 million old video games they have sitting around the house.

For those customers who don't normally get into a GameStop, Walmart is offering an option for those games collecting dust at home. The company says it will pay more for used games -- in the form of store credit -- and sell them for less money than competitors. Used games will sell for an average of $35.





Investors will likely be looking closely at whether GameStop, the biggest video-game seller in the country, can survive the move. The company's stock rose 2 percent Monday to close at $39.75. Investors will likely be looking closely at whether GameStop, the biggest video-game seller in the country, can survive the move. The company's stock rose 2 percent Monday to close at $39.75.





The company is already threatened by a broad industry move to online and disk-less gaming, though it does offer exclusive digital content with major game releases. You don't need to visit GameStop to play "Candy Crush Saga," for example.





Meanwhile, used games are where GameStop rakes in the cash, with a margin of nearly 50 percent, reports analysts at Trefis . GameStop is trying to diversify by also selling used tablets and smartphones.





Overall, used video-game sales make up a fraction of the industry. Last month, about 56 percent of all U.S. video game spending went to new game products. Another 35 percent went to online and mobile downloads, The NPD Group reports . Only about 9 percent went to used game sales and rentals.





How will Walmart change those numbers? And how many price-conscious customers will now leave the retailer's video-game aisles with a used disk rather than a new one? Certainly, Walmart has the power to significantly drive sales of pre-owned games, sales that to this point have been a mostly niche business.

Walmart ( WMT ) is set to start buying and selling used video games, a move that promises to send shock waves across the gaming industry.###1107||Why did this happen?

Walmart is planning to make a splash in the used-games business, the company announced on Tuesday.

Starting March 26, consumers can walk into more than 3,100 Walmart stores across the US and trade in games from the latest consoles, including the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Wii U. Customers will receive eGift cards for the value of their trade-in which can be used to purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. Walmart said customers will be able to purchase "Certified Pre-Owned" games in stores and online starting this summer.

The company joins GameStop and Best Buy, among others, offering trade-ins for video games.

Video game trade-in programs are extremely controversial. As Walmart points out, the US market for used games has hit $2 billion annually. However, game developers and publishers have railed against its growth, saying that it's effectively taking cash from their pockets.

When used games are sold back to retailers, game companies don't get a cut of the action. When they're sold at a profit, they're also left out. The games industry has lobbied for changes to that practice, but so far, those efforts have not proven fruitful.###1116||Empty###1117||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Oracle Corporation (ORCL) is tumbling in extended trading after third-quarter earnings and sales came in below analysts' estimates.

After the bell, shares had taken off 5.4% to $36.81.

The enterprise software developer recorded revenue of $9.3 billion in the three months to February, a 4% year-over-year increase. However, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast slightly-higher sales of $9.36 billion.

Adjusted net income of 68 cents a share fell short of consensus by 2 cents.

A strengthening U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies and exchange rate changes in Venezuela negatively impacted earning power, the company said in a statement.

The board also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents a share. The dividend will be paid to shareholders of record as of April 8 with payment on April 29.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, who signed the bill into law, called it an important clarification to make sure minors don't illegally access marijuana.

"Marijuana should not be easily accessible or attractive to kids," Hickenlooper said.

The new law requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

Most medical marijuana sold commercially already complies with existing recreational packaging standards.

The new law also gives marijuana shops the same authority that liquor stores have to confiscate fraudulent IDs from underage consumers. It passed unanimously in both chambers of the Legislature.

"Everyone came together on this," said Rep. Daniel Kagan, a Denver Democrat who sponsored the law.

Dr. George Sam Wang, a pediatric emergency room physician from Children's Hospital Colorado, joined the bill signing and said there's anecdotal evidence of emergency rooms seeing more cases of youth marijuana overdoses.

But Wang said there's not enough data to draw conclusions on the effect of recreational pot, and that more study is needed.

"We've only been experiencing this for a couple years," Wang said.

Another new law signed Monday allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already completes state-level background checks.

Asked whether the marijuana industry needs additional curbs — including a possible potency limit or new limits on edible pot — Hickenlooper said it was too soon to advocate for more sweeping changes.

"This is brand-new territory," the governor said.

Some lawmakers have said they want to propose curbs on edible pot, but no such bill has yet been introduced.

Legislators are still mulling pot taxes. The first $40 million from pot excise taxes is devoted to education, but lawmakers will decide how to spend any additional tax revenue.

Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, wants to see a task force of lawmakers and industry activists discuss the best way to spend excess tax revenue. He met with industry representatives Monday.

Among the ideas from industry representatives were more money for researching the health effects of cannabis and trying again to create a state-chartered bank to serve the industry.

-- The Associated Press###1121||Empty###1122||NEW YORK | Walmart Stores Inc. is hoping to shake off the winter sales doldrums with its biggest spring sales push ever.

The world's largest retailer is discounting more than 60 outdoor essentials from lawn mowers to mulch by 30 percent to 50 percent in a push that aims to take business from competitors like Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos.

The sale starts Friday and will run through March 29. Items include a seven piece-Mainstays patio furniture set for $298, $15 stacking sling chairs, $88 Kingsford charcoal grills and $144 lawnmowers from brands like Murray and Snapper.

Shoppers also can find five bags of Miracle-Gro garden soil for $10 and bags of mulch for $1.97 each. The event will be advertised in a 12-page Sunday circular.

Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., said the sale was planned last summer as executives received forecasts that the winter was going to be especially harsh. But the company made changes since then because the winter was even more severe than expected.

Walmart is counting on an extra boost in sales from items like garden soil as shoppers prepare to restore their gardens and outdoor living spaces hurt by a series of winter storms.

Walmart and other retailers have seen their sales chilled by storms that caused them to close hundreds of stores and kept shoppers at home. The discounter said in February that during the height of winter storms, it had more than 200 stores closed.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Michelle Gloeckler, Walmart's senior vice president of home, described the sales event as offering Black Friday-like prices.

"I love the fact that we had a rough winter because people are going to be so ready," she said. She noted that Walmart dramatically increased the quantities of items such as mulch and other outdoor products, in anticipation of increased customer demand. She declined to offer figures.

Walmart's lawn and garden offerings, including plants, also are tailored to the climates of each region. For example, customers in southern markets such as Dallas and Atlanta will find warmer-season plants including petunias and marigolds. Shoppers in northern markets like Chicago and New York will find cold-tolerant varieties such as pansies and snapdragons.###1123||The is stable on Tuesday, as the pair trades slightly above the 1.39 line in the European session. The markets are following fast-moving events in the Ukraine, as Crimea has voted to join Russia and the EU and the US have responded with limited sanctions. Turning to economic news, German ZEW Economic Sentiment looked awful, sliding to a ten-month low. The Eurozone indicator also slipped badly. As well, the German Constitutional Court confirmed the legality of the European Stability Mechanism. In the US, there are two major events on the schedule - Core CPI and Building Permits.

Events are moving quickly in the Ukrainian crisis. Voters in Crimea voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in Sunday's referendum, and Russian Prime Minister Putin has recognized Crimea as an independent state, paving the way for annexation. Putin will address a special session of the Russian parliament on Tuesday. The EU and US have responded with targeted sanctions, freezing assets of several high-ranking Russian officials. Additional sanctions are expected, possibly as early as this week.

US releases looked weak on Friday. PPI posted a decline for the first time since November, coming in at -0.1%. The estimate stood at +0.2%. Preliminary UoM Consumer Sentiment dropped below the 80-point level for the first time since November, slipping to 79.9 points. This was short of the estimate of 81.9 points. The weak PPI points to persistently low inflation numbers, which is indicative of an underperforming economy. Recent US numbers have certainly not dazzled, but they should be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to go ahead with another taper of QE. This would be the third trim of the Fed's asset-buying scheme, and would reduce QE to $55 billion per month. These tapers are dollar-positive and mark a vote of confidence in the US economy by the Federal Reserve.

The European Stability Mechanism, which is the Eurozone's bailout fund, was confirmed as legal by the German Federal Constitutional Court on Tuesday. Germany is the biggest contributor to the EUR 970 billion fund. In February, the court deferred a decision on the Outright Monetary Transactions, which is credited with saving weak members of the Eurozone, to the European Court of Justice.

Original post###1124||The Bayou State set a record in January with an unemployment rate the lowest since 2008 and with 25,000 more people employed than the year prior. It was the fifth straight month that unemployment fell in Louisiana.

In January, 1,990,531 people were employed in Louisiana, helping lower the state's unemployment rate to 4.9 percent, according to figures released from state labor officials.

Seasonally adjusted data released by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show that there were 25,787 more people employed this January than were employed in January 2013; while there were 102,47 people unemployed, translating to 29,310 fewer people not working the year earlier. BLS surveyed 750 households to compile the figures.

The national unemployment rate for January was at 6.6 percent.

In January, Louisiana's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was at its lowest since September 2008 and lowest in the 17-state southern region, where 6.2 percent was the average rate.

The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate improved in every parish and in all eight metropolitan areas for January 2014. Baton Rouge's unemployment rate dropped to 4.8 percent, from 7.1 percent the year prior. New Orleans' rate decreased to 5.1 percent, down from 7.2 percent in January 2013.

"2014 is picking up right where 2013 left off," said Curt Eysink, executive director of the Louisiana Workforce Commission in a statement. "Our labor markets are strong and we expect employment will continue to increase as billions of dollars of new projects ramp up during the next three or four years."

The total number of people employed and unemployed, more commonly known as Louisiana's civilian labor force, was 2,093,007 in January, 3,523 fewer than January 2013.

Seasonally adjusted total non-farm employment was 1,956,300 in January. According to the BLS, leisure and hospitality increased the most among all employment sectors with a 10,000-job increase over the year.

Other industries experiencing large increases included transportation, trade and utilities at 5,300; education and health services with a 4,200 jump; and the manufacturing industry with a 2,700 increase.

The largest decline, however, came in the government sector. About 7,200 fewer federal, state and local jobs were counted than in January 2013. Also declining were the information industry, which lost 2,500 jobs; and the mining and logging industry, which decreased by 700 jobs.

###1125||Visa and MasterCard have blocked credit card services to some Russian bank customers as a result of US sanctions, BBC reports.

Four banks are so far affected, all of which have links to Russians blacklisted by the US.

Visa and MasterCard, both US-based companies, are forbidden from having any dealings with those targeted by the sanctions.

The banks, which said card services stopped without warning, have described the move as unlawful.

'Frozen out'

One of the banks affected, Bank Rossiya, is described by the US as Russia's 15th largest, with assets of $12bn (£7.27bn).

The St Petersburg-based bank has been singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials. US officials said it would be "frozen out" from the dollar.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Bank Rossiya had nothing to do with events in Crimea and promised to transfer his wages there.

"I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday," he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

President Putin also instructed the Russian central bank to step in, if needed, but the latter said the sanctions on Bank Rossiya did "not have a serious bearing on the lender's financial stability".

'Illegitimate'

Visa and Mastercard also confirmed they had stopped providing services to SMP Bank, which is controlled by US-blacklisted brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.

The bank, which is Russia's 39th biggest with $5bn in assets, called the actions "illegitimate" because its owners, rather than the bank itself, were the subject of sanctions.

Bank Rossiya's affiliate banks, Sobinbank and InvestKapitalBank, were also affected.

But Visa said more than 99% of its business in Russia was untouched by sanctions.

Russian shares fell sharply on Friday as investors weighed the impact of western sanctions over Ukraine.

The MICEX index, which is priced in roubles, fell as much as 3% and the RTS, which is priced in dollars fell 3.6%.

Stocks slumped after US President Barack Obama said sanctions might be extended to key parts of the Russian economy if Russia took further action in Ukraine.

Share fallsRussia's mining, defence and natural resources sectors could all be targets.

Stocks recovered some ground during the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to restore calm following the introduction of asset freezes and visa bans by the US against high ranking Russian officials.

The MICEX closed down 1% and the RTS index was down 1.3% at the end of the day.

Although only banks with connections to high-ranking Russian officials have been targeted, Russian bank shares were broadly lower.

Shares in Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, closed 1.17% lower - having fallen 2.9% earlier on Friday, while shares in VTB Bank were 2.61% lower after falling 4.3% earlier in the day.

Other sectors were also hit. Gas giant Gazprom was down 0.9%, oil firm Lukoil ended the day 1.36% higher. Russian steel company NLMK closed 1.94% lower.

Shares in gas producer Novatek closed down 9.63%. The company is part owned by Gennady Timchenko, a shareholder in Bank Rossiya and one of the wealthy Russian businessmen targeted by Western sanctions.

Negative outlook

Ratings agencies S&P and Fitch warned they were changing their outlook for the Russian economy to "negative" from "stable" - the first stage before a possible downgrade in the country's credit rating - because of the potential impact of sanctions.

Fitch said: "Since US and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support."

Regulatory changes are aiming to make reverse mortgages safer, writes the Wall Street Journal in a report this week, cautioning that the loans are still not for everyone.

The changes are working to ensure borrowers can uphold their loan obligations and make it “harder for borrowers to dig themselves into a hole,” the WSJ writes.

“Used wisely, reverse mortgages enable older adults to tap the value of their homes without having to uproot themselves and sell,” the report states. “But experts warn retirees to tread carefully with these complicated loans. Used improperly, a reverse mortgage can leave a retiree broke and without a roof over his head.”

The WSJ spoke with elder law expert Bernard Krooks of Littman Krooks LLP who noted that reverse mortgages are more complicated than other types of loans, particularly forward mortgages.

AARP policy advisor Lori Trawinski also weight in noting that like any loan, a reverse mortgage comes with obligations that must be met.

“The important thing about these mortgages that people really need to remember is that they are loans, and as with any loans they come with a set of obligations,” Trawinski told the WSJ.

The decision to take a reverse mortgage should consider input from advisers, accountants and estate-planning attorneys, WSJ says, including an overall outlook on the borrower’s financial situation.

“While it can be a useful part of estate planning, it’s not for everyone,” Krooks said. “It shouldn’t be done without being looked at in terms of overall financial needs.”

"For all the concern there's been about the used video-game model as digital and online video games take share, Wal-Mart getting in validates the business model," said Oppenheimer retail analyst Brian Nagel.



"We aren't participating in the $2 billion used gaming opportunity at all right now," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters that announced the news.



According to NPD, video-game sales fell 17 percent during the most recent holiday season.

However, despite the decline, Wal-Mart said it still expects there was an inflection point in gaming with the new hardware that came out last fall, Mac Naughton said.

No doubt, Wal-Mart likely hopes the program will generate foot traffic, or help it capture a larger share of new-release game sales as those trade-in dollars are turned into sales.



But some observers said the bigger question may be the program's possible impact on competitors like GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, eBay and others that currently offer trade-in programs.

That's because the business can be lucrative. While the industry saw video-game sales fall over the holiday season, GameStop reported a 7 percent increase in used game sales for the period.

If the new video game trade-in program follows the example of Wal-Mart's current electronic trade-in programs, the value of the video game will be as competitive as the market allows.

###1128||Trading video games for groceries might sound like an odd concept, but it's one of the many exchanges you'll soon get to make at Walmart. The mega-retailer is now accepting trade-ins on used games at its stores, allowing you to turn your old copies of "Call of Duty" and "Halo" into gift cards to be used online or at any Walmart or Sam's Club location.

The program, launching Mar. 26, will allow shoppers to trade in games "for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox 360." Once a game is brought in, Walmart will scan the UPC, check the disk for any damage and provide a trade-in value based on the game's condition.

All used games will be refurbished and sold in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition later this year.

"There are almost a billion video games sitting unused in homes across the United States," said Justin Williamson, director of entertainment for Walmart.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," he continued in a blog post.

Walmart's new trade-in initiative will debut at more than 3,100 locations throughout the United States. The retailer has yet to list any specific trade-in values for popular games like "Titanfall" and "Dark Souls II," so we'll have to wait and see how Walmart's prices stack up to those of Best Buy and Gamestop.

This isn't Walmart's first foray into the world of exchanging electronics, as the store accepts trade-ins on smartphones, tablets and MP3 players.

The company’s revenue has decreased in two consecutive quarters and marked a 4.8% decline to 1.7 billion dollars in the three months through December 27th.

A person with knowledge of the situation reported that Symantec was also troubled about its product strategy. The person commented for the Financial Times: “It is hard when an organisation goes through that much turnover, it loses institutional knowledge and hurts momentum. When you see that amount of turnover it might be an underlying problem with the leadership.”

The company made an official statement, announcing its decision. Symantec explained that it is a part of an “ongoing process” and “terminating” Mr. Bennet as CEO is not based on any event on impropriety. Daniel Schulman, who is the current Chairman of Symantec Corp. said in the statement that one of the main priorities of the company will stay focused on its target of revenue growth.

Part of Mr. Schulman’s statement was cited by Bloomberg: “Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”

The company’s board member Michael Brown was appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer while Symantec Corp. is looking for a successor to Mr. Bennett. The company explained in its statement that it is working in cooperation with an executive search firm in order to find a permanent replacement.

Mr. Steve Bennett first joined the company as a Chairman and then took the position of Chief Executive Officer in July 2012, replacing Mr. Enrique Salem. Since last July, five senior executives departed, all sharing their beliefs that Mr. Bennett was not an appropriate choice for the CEO position, according to another person familiar with these issues.

One of the analysts working for FBR Capital Merkets & Co. – Daniel Ives, said for Bloomberg: “It’s jaw-dropping. Bennett is the face of the turnaround at Symantec. Investors bought into him leading this turnaround, so the fact that now he gets fired at this critical juncture, I view it as a major black eye.”

Mr. Bennett did not respond to e-mail requests to comment the situation.

Symantec Corp. rose by 1.58% on Thursday to close the session at $20.91 a share, marking a one-year change of -14.32%. The company is valued at $14.46 billion According to CNN Money, the 22 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Symantec Corp. have a median target of $26.00, with a high estimate of $33.00 and a low estimate of $18.00. The median estimate represents a +24.37% increase from the last price.###1130||We’re writing to thank you for your Times and Democrat subscription, and to share some tips and handy links that you can use to take advantage of the exciting new full-access program.###1131||This article is from the archive of our partner .

Retail goliath Walmart is going to start allowing customers to trade-in their used video games for re-sale, taking a big bite out of a major plank of GameStop's business.

GameStop is the largest chain of video game retailers in America, and while they sell both new consoles and the latest games, buying back and then selling pre-owned games has been a vital part of their revenue. Specifically, "used products represented nearly a quarter of its $2.1 billion in sales and more than 44% of gross profit in the quarter ended Nov. 2," The Wall Street Journal reported. That might be a bit surprising for anyone who might believe that $500 consoles like the PS4 and new games that cost at $60 (not counting add-ons) drove profits for video game stores.

For Walmart cashing in on $520 million (25% of GameStop's sales) might seem like chump change. But that they have bigger reach and more customers than GameStop, which mean they could make more money.

Of course, it's not just the re-sales of old games where Walmart will clean up. Customers will receive payment in gift cards up to $35 ... that they can use at Walmart. The new trade-in program begins next week.

For their part, GameStop doesn't seem worried. (Or at least isn't pretending to be.) "We win those market share battles because we've been at it a long time," GameStop's Chief Executive Paul Raines said.

Health insurance premiums have risen more after Obamacare than the average premium increases over the eight years before it became law, according to the private health exchange eHealthInsurance.

The individual market for health insurance has seen premiums rise by 39 percent since February 2013, eHealth reports. Without a subsidy, the average individual premium is now $274 a month. Families have been hit even harder with an average increase of 56 percent over the same period — average premiums are now $663 per family, over $426 last year.

Between 2005 and 2013, average premiums for individual plans increased 37 percent and average family premiums were upped 31 percent. So they have risen faster under Obamacare than in the previous eight years.

An important caveat is that eHealth’s prices don’t include subsidies, so the prices for anyone earning between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level will be lower. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has repeatedly claimed patients will pay as little as $18 per month, without noting the taxpayer cost.

Premiums are being hiked across the board for several reasons, but the biggest contributor is the Obama administration’s highly touted “essential health benefits,” services that insurers on and off exchanges must provide.

Some benefits, such as emergency and laboratory services, are uncontroversial. But others, like maternity, newborn and pediatric services, are causing headaches for huge swaths of the population that don’t need them. Anyone past childbearing age, single men, the infertile, even nuns — their premiums are rising as well, because their plans must, by law, provide more services.

But premiums aren’t the only key to health care costs — deductibles and out-of-pocket costs like co-pays are also rising. When it comes to employer health plans alone, four out of five U.S. companies have increased deductibles or are considering doing so.

Prices may be people away from purchasing health insurance. The latest survey from consulting firm McKinsey found that half of those who haven’t purchased health insurance yet this year cited their inability to pay the premium.

The bike share program’s survival depends on its appeal to tourist and expansion to new neighborhoods. Citi Bike leaders have reached out to officials in the de Blasio administration to that effect, pushing for a lift in the rates charged for the blue bikes’ use.

Polly Trottenberg, the city’s new transportation commissioner, told the Wall Street Journal that Citi Bike faces “a number of financial and operational challenges,” the details of which she did not specify. “We are working as diligently as we can to help the company resolve them and strengthen the program going forward,” she said before the City Council’s transportation committee in a March 6 meeting.

Among Citi Bike’s recent issues are equipment damage sustained during Superstorm Sandy, software glitches, a frigid 2013-14 winter that hurt ridership and a greater popularity with annual users than daily or hourly ones. Those long-term riders generate less revenue with the $95 per year plus tax that they pay to use the bikes than those who purchase a 24-hour pass, which costs $9.95 plus tax, or a $25-plus-tax seven-day pass.

The bike share program has also had to contend with lawsuits from a number of New York City residential buildings, which aimed to remove stations from in front of Petrosino Square, 99 Bank Street and Cambridge House at 175 West 13th Street. A suit regarding the station in front of the Plaza hotel remains in limbo.

Others in the real estate industry, however, have embraced bike share stations as a building amenity. Brokerage aptsandlofts.com added a function to its website showing listings’ distance from the nearest station in June of 2013. [WSJ] — Julie Strickland###1137||Walmart has announced that it will serve the 110 million gamers across the U.S. by allowing them to ,”unlock value in their current purchases and save even more when it comes to one of the fastest-growing forms of entertainment.”



Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.



“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. “When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”



How it Works

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com

Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary.



Certified Pre-Owned Video Games in Stores Later this Year



Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com. The video games will be labeled “Certified Pre-Owned” which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.



“While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we’re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,” added Mac Naughton.###1138||Empty###1139||Health industry officials say Obamacare premiums will likely double, and in some cases triple, in certain parts of the country next year, and announcements of rate hikes could come within months, potentially adding to the pressure on Democrats going into the midterm elections.The botched rollout of the federal healthcare program, including its numerous delays and changes, is one of the chief reasons for impending hikes, officials told The Hill, as is the impact on insurers of Obamacare's new fees and regulatory restrictions."Everyone knows that the way the exchange has rolled out … is going to lead to higher costs," a senior insurance executive who requested anonymity told The Hill.Another official told The Hill, "All these major delays on very significant portions of the law are going to change what it's going to cost."But the most significant cause of rate increases, officials say, is related to the administration's erroneous projections about the number of young healthy consumers who would enroll."Demographics matter a lot because they will help determine whether the health insurance market goes into a death spiral (or requires hefty federal subsidies to keep it from doing so)," Megan McArdle writes in her column for Bloomberg View."Young healthy people, and a lot of them, are needed to keep the market stable and premiums low. As we head into the final few weeks, we have a pretty good idea of how many young healthy people there will be, and the answer is: a whole lot fewer than the healthcare wonks were expecting."The Obama administration estimated that roughly 40 percent of Obamacare's enrollees would need to be between the ages of 18 and 35 to keep Obamacare financially solvent and premiums would cover costs.As of March 1, just 25 percent of those enrolled were young people. McArdle cites figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation which indicate that if enrollment remains at that level by the end of March, costs would be 2.45 percent more than premiums. Additionally, even if youth enrollment increased to 33 percent, costs would still be greater than premiums at 1.1 percent.The Obama administration has insisted that the rate of enrollment for the young would accelerate in the final weeks, and has orchestrated a major push to sign up young people before the March 31 deadline.But McArdle points out that even in the unlikely event that "enrollment is truly massive," it still won't be enough.Insurance officials emphasized that rate hikes will vary significantly depending on the region and the carrier, but areas of the country with older, less healthy populations are likely to be affected most.The industry warnings come less than a week after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admitted to congressional lawmakers that rates would increase in 2015. She emphasized, however, that growth would be slower than in the past, The Wall Street Journal reported."The increases are far less significant than what they were prior to the Affordable Care Act," Sebelius said during testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee.One official said he believes Sebelius' comments were a "pre-emptive strike" and an attempt to "soften up the American public" to the likelihood of premium increases."My gut tells me that, for some people, these increases will be significant," Bill Hoagland, a former executive at Cigna and senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told The Hill. "That was her way of getting out in front of it."Other health industry insiders say it's too soon to assess the accuracy of Sebelius' predictions."Health premiums increase every year, so the odds are very good that they will increase next year, as well. None of that is news. The question is whether it will be a lot or a little. That depends in part on how big the insurers think the exchanges will be," David Cutler, one of Obamacare's architects, told The Hill.Jon Gruber, who also helped design the new healthcare program, said, "The bottom line is that we just don't know. Premiums were rising 7 to 10 percent a year before the law. So the question is whether we will see a continuation of that sort of single-digit increase, as Sebelius said, or whether it will be larger."The picture is expected to become clearer as insurers begin the process this spring of filing their rate proposals with state insurance commissioners.It is possible that some insurers will continue to hold rates low to remain competitive, though some initially underpriced their policies to attract customers in the first year, expecting to raise rates in the second year, according to The Hill.If the predictions of major rate increases come to fruition, the political fallout for the Democrats — who will already be under intense pressure in the midterm elections due to the troubled healthcare law — could be even more significant.Rate hikes would also likely undermine Obamacare enrollment efforts in 2015, The Hill reported.###1140||Empty###1141||CLOSE Sally Beauty is the latest retailer to fall victim to hackers.

Yet another retailer is fessing-up with some details of a data snafu.

Sally Beauty, one of the world's largest retailers of professional beauty products, is reporting that a security breach discovered on March 5, affected fewer than 25,000 a credit and debit card accounts.

The Denton, Texas-based seller of beauty supplies says it is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm and says that it's working with the U.S. Secret Service.

"We take this criminal activity very seriously," the company said in a statement. "We continue to work diligently with Verizon on this investigation and are taking necessary actions and precautions to mitigate and remediate the issues caused by this security incident. In addition, we are working with the United States Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter."

WHAT TO DO: Protecting yourself from identity theft

For the nation's retailers, data breaches have become an explosive issue -- and a driver of serious consumer angst -- since Target reported a massive security breach shortly before Christmas. Other major retailers, including Neiman Marcus, have reported data breaches since the holiday season.

It's become a key concern for consumers, and some recent reports even show the data snafu may be cutting into customer traffic at Target stores as some concerned customers shop elsewhere.

Sally Beauty currently owns and operates more than 2,800 Sally Beauty Supply stores worldwide, including stores in every state in the United States; Puerto Rico and Canada. Sally Beauty Supply offers over 6,000 professional quality products for hair, skin and nails to retail customers and salon professionals.

The company has loyalty discount programs, such as the Beauty Club Card, for non-professional customers and the Sally ProCard for professional customers.

The US says it has returned the rogue oil tanker Morning Glory to the Libyan government.

The North Korea-flagged ship had been loaded at a rebel-held port and evaded a naval blockade before being boarded by US Navy Seals south of Cyprus.

Its evasion prompted parliament to sack Prime Minister Ali Zeidan.

The US said it had handed over the ship, cargo and crew to Libyan forces in international waters off the coast of Libya.

Rebels had loaded the Morning Glory with oil at the port of Sidra. It was unclear where it was heading.

It was the first vessel loaded at a rebel-held port since a separatist revolt against the central government in Tripoli erupted in July 2013.

'Smoothly'

Rebels under Ibrahim Jathran hold three ports, and are demanding a greater share of the country's oil revenue.

Earlier, the Lana state news agency reported clashes between his fighters and Libyan troops in his hometown of Ajdabiya.

The US embassy said in a statement that the handover of ship, cargo and crew had gone "smoothly and as planned".

It added: "We have been assured by the government of Libya that the captain, crew members and Libyan nationals who were aboard the stateless tanker will be treated humanely in accordance with internationally recognised standards of human rights."

The Navy Seals operation had been authorised by President Barack Obama and no-one was hurt.

The vessel was flagged in North Korea but officials in Pyongyang said it had been deregistered because of the incident. It was said to have been operated by an Egyptian company.

The Libyan government is still struggling to assert its authority on rebel groups that helped to overthrow Col Muammar Gaddafi.###1143||We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

The latest possible lead came as the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 entered its third week, with still no confirmed trace found of the Boeing 777 or the 239 people on board.

The new potential sighting was dramatically announced by Malaysia's acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, after he was handed a note with details during a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, scooping the official announcement from China.

"Chinese ships have been dispatched to the area," Hishammuddin told reporters.

China said the object was 22 metres long (74ft) and 13 metres (43ft) wide, and spotted around 120 km (75 miles) "south by west" of potential debris reported by Australia off its west coast in the forbidding waters of the southern Indian Ocean.

The image was captured by the high-definition Earth observation satellite "Gaofen-1" early on March 18, two days after the Australian satellite picture was taken, China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) said on its website.

It could not easily be determined from the blurred images whether the objects were the same, but the Chinese photograph could depict a cluster of smaller objects, a senior military officer from one of the 26 nations involved in the search for the plane said.

The wing of a Boeing 777-200ER is approximately 27 metres long and 14 metres wide at its base, according to estimates derived from publicly available scale drawings. Its fuselage is 63.7 metres long by 6.2 metres wide.

Flight MH370 vanished from civilian radar screens early on March 8, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on a scheduled flight to Beijing.

Investigators believe someone on board shut off the plane's communications systems, and partial military radar tracking showed it turning west and re-crossing the Malay Peninsula, apparently under the control of a skilled pilot.

That has led them to focus on hijacking or sabotage, but they have not ruled out technical problems.

REMOTE SEAS

Since Australia announced the first image of what could be parts of the aircraft on Thursday, the international search for the plane has focused on an expanse of ocean more than 2,000 km (1,200 miles) southwest of Perth.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said one of its aircraft reported sighting a number of "small objects" with the naked eye, including a wooden pallet, within a radius of 5 km.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion aircraft took a closer look but only reported seeing clumps of seaweed. It dropped a marker buoy to track the movement.

"A merchant ship in the area has been tasked to relocate and seek to identify the material," AMSA said in a statement.

The search area experienced good weather conditions on Saturday with visibility of around 10 km and moderate seas.

Australia, which is coordinating the rescue, has cautioned the objects in the satellite image might be a lost shipping container or other debris, and may have sunk since the picture was taken.

"Even though this is not a definite lead, it is probably more solid than any other lead around the world and that is why so much effort and interest is being put into this search," Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss told reporters, before latest Chinese image was reported.

China said its icebreaker "Snow Dragon" was heading for the area, but was still around 70 hours away. Japan and India were also sending more planes and Australian and Chinese navy vessels were steaming towards the southern search zone.

But the area is known for rough seas and strong currents, and Malaysia's Hishammuddin said a cyclone warning had been declared for Christmas Island, far off to the north.

"There are vessels heading in that direction. They may have to go through the cyclone," he said.

"Generally, conditions in the southern corridor are very challenging," said Hishammuddin. "The ocean varies between 1,150 metres and 7,000 metres in depth."

NO SIGN IN NORTHERN CORRIDOR

Where the missing plane went after it flew out of range of Malaysia's military radar off the country's northwest coast has been one of the most puzzling aspects of what has quickly become perhaps the biggest mystery in modern aviation history.

Electronic "pings" detected by a commercial satellite suggested it flew for another six hours or so, but could do no better than place its final signal on one of two vast arcs: a northern corridor from Laos to the Caspian Sea, and a southern one stretching from Indonesia down to the part of the Indian Ocean that has become the focal point of the search.

Malaysia has said the search will continue in both corridors until confirmed debris is found.

Hishammuddin said that, in response to a formal diplomatic request from Malaysia, China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan had all said, based on preliminary analysis, that there have been no sightings of the aircraft on their radar.

Aircraft and ships have renewed the search in the Andaman Sea between India and Thailand, going over areas in the northern corridor that have already been exhaustively swept.

The Pentagon said it was considering a request from Malaysia for sonar equipment. The P-8 and P-3 spy planes, which the United States is already deploying in the search, also carry "sonobuoys" that are dropped into the sea and use sonar signals to search the waters below.

The search itself has strained ties between China and Malaysia, with Beijing repeatedly leaning on the Southeast Asian nation to step up its hunt and do a better job at looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers.

For families of the passengers, the process has proved to be an emotionally wrenching battle to elicit information.

In a statement on Saturday, relatives in Beijing lambasted a Malaysian delegation for "concealing the truth" and "making fools" out of the families after they said they left a meeting without answering all their questions.

"This kind of conduct neglects the lives of all the passengers, shows contempt for all their families, and even more, tramples on the dignity of Chinese people and the Chinese government," they said.

Some experts have argued that the reluctance to share sensitive radar data and capabilities in a region fraught with suspicion amid China's military rise and territorial disputes may have hampered the search.

The settlement, which isn’t final, could be announced as early as Wednesday in the U.S. and will be for $1.2 billion, said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the agreement isn’t public.

The carmaker recalled more than 10 million vehicles for problems related to unintended acceleration in 2009 and 2010, starting with a September 2009 announcement that it was recalling 3.8 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles because of a defect that might cause floor mats to jam accelerator pedals. The company later recalled vehicles over defects involving the pedals themselves.

In addition to the criminal probe by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office and the New York office of Federal Bureau of Investigation, the recalls led to lawsuits claiming that defects harmed the value of Toyota vehicles or caused accidents leading to death and injury. Toyota settled suits brought by car owners who claimed economic losses for about $1.6 billion.

Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, declined to comment on the settlement. Kelly Langmesser, a spokeswoman for the FBI in New York, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on it.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” Steve Curtis, a Toyota spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

Curtis declined to comment on a possible settlement.

The settlement was reported earlier by CNN.###1149||German analyst and investor sentiment plunged in March at the fastest pace in nearly a year amid fears that the crisis in Ukraine could weigh on Europe's largest economy, a leading survey showed today.



Think tank ZEW's monthly survey of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts.

The consensus forecast was for 53. The drop was the sharpest fall since April 2013 and the third drop in a row.

"The Crimea crisis is weighing on expert's economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW president Clemens Fuest. "Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk."

The seizure of the Ukrainian region of Crimea by Russian-speaking troops has prompted the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War. The US and European Union imposed personal sanctions yesterday on Russian and Crimean officials involved in the seizure.



The ZEW survey showed a separate gauge of current conditionsrose to 51.3 points from 50 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52 but still emphasising the strength of the German economy.



The German economy, a growth engine in the early years of the euro crisis, has slowed in the last two years as exports weakened and some firms delayed investments but the government expects it to grow by 1.8% this year - more than four times as strongly as in 2013 thanks to domestic demand.



Recent economic data has been upbeat with industrial output and orders and exports rising in January. Other sentiment indicators have also painted a rosy picture of the economy, with consumers feeling their most positive in seven years and business morale rising.



The ZEW index was based on a survey of 241 analysts andinvestors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said.###1150||Here are some things going on this morning in your world of tech:

Fears over Russia&39;s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday&39;s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered economic sanctions against nearly two dozen members of Putin&39;s inner circle and a major Russian bank that provides them support.

Putin&39;s chief of staff and four influential businessmen who are believed to be Putin&39;s lifelong friends were among the 20 individuals sanctioned

The MICEX benchmark was down nearly 3 percent two hours into Friday trading waith the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were taking a pounding, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury&39;s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them.

U.S. officials described Russia&39;s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a "personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation."

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them "without prior notification."

SMP&39;s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg - billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin - were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia&39;s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard&39;s actions as "illegitimate" because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

Though customers in the two banks won&39;t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops or online or even withdraw cash from ATMs, the clients can get cash directly from the banks.

Russia&39;s central bank sought to assure that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. authorities "does not have a serious bearing on the lender&39;s financial stability."

However, it added that the government could "take necessary steps to support the lender and the interests of its depositors and creditors."

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor&39;s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded.

In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia&39;s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia&39;s economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia&39;s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country&39;s borrowing costs more expensive.

"Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support," Fitch said.

RUSSIA TO HOLD OFF ON RECIPROCAL SANCTIONS

Earlier on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would for now hold off on more reciprocal sanctions against the United States, after Washington introduced punitive measures against his close allies over the Ukraine crisis.

"You know, both in the first case -- the American sanctions -- and in the second case -- the introduction of a visa regime with Ukraine -- I think we should for now hold off on reciprocal steps," Putin told a meeting of his Security Council in comments released by the Kremlin.###1153||Empty###1154||Why did this happen?

* Short-term safe-haven bids for yen unwound after calm Crimean referendum

* IMM data shows long dollar bets pared

* China’s yuan weakens after trading band widened over weekend

By Anirban Nag and Patrick Graham

LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - The euro held within sight of long-term highs against the dollar on Monday, resisting selling after a dip in euro zone inflation, the latest indicator to argue for outright money-printing by the European Central Bank to support growth.

The dollar gained against the yen as European stocks and U.S. futures headed into positive territory, helped by the lack of any dramatic further developments in Ukraine after the Crimea region voted in favour of annexation by Moscow.

Over 95 percent of Crimean voters chose in a Sunday referendum to join Russia, an outcome denounced by Western powers and Kiev as illegal and a sham.

The risk of flare-ups in tension between Russia and Ukraine has underpinned demand for safe-haven currencies like the yen and the Swiss franc and some of the bets on those currencies left on ahead of the referendum were unwound on Monday.

“The yen has fallen after the Crimean vote but I would say many people are going to remain cautious,” said Jane Foley, a currency strategist with Rabobank in London.

“What we don’t really know about is what is going to happen to eastern Ukraine. So people are going to just watch the newsflow carefully.”

The dollar was up 0.45 percent at 101.78 yen, still within sight of a two-week low of 101.205 yen struck on Friday and compared to a 1-1/2 month high of 103.77 yen hit on March 7.

The euro was down less than 0.2 percent on the day at $1.3889, unchanged from morning levels after February inflation was revised lower. It has traded within about a cent of a 2-1/2-year high around $1.3967 since last Thursday, when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi knocked it lower by voicing concerns about its strength.

“We have seen some tangible developments on data and from the ECB that should be negative for the euro yet it hasn’t weakened substantially,” said Foley.

“I think increasingly the euro is exhibiting safe haven properties. If, for example, money is being herded out of eastern Europe it is quite feasible that one of the first places it will go is the euro.”

FEWER DOLLAR BULLS

The dollar has failed to deliver the strength predicted by many banks earlier this year, with the euro up four cents from late January lows.

Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday showed that speculators pared bullish bets on the dollar for a fifth straight week through March 11, with net longs falling to their lowest in more than four months.

Overall, though, investors have maintained net long positions on the dollar for 19 consecutive weeks. The last time speculators were short the greenback was in late October 2013.

A record drop in foreign governments’ holdings of U.S. Treasuries led some to speculate that Russia has been reducing its dollar reserves ahead of possible sanctions from the West.

Investors were also considering the implications of Beijing’s announcement on Saturday that it will double the daily trading range for the yuan. The step was viewed as a sign of confidence that the central bank had successfully fought off currency speculation.

“Nothing forced them to widen the band this weekend, so it will be seen as a continuation of long-term policy,” Citi strategist, Steve Englander wrote in a note. “I would see it as slightly risk-on. Small positive for the Australian dollar, small negative for the yen, but again a second-order impact.”

The yuan weakened on Monday.###1158||DENTON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As we previously stated on March 5th, our systems detected an unauthorized attempted intrusion into our Sally Beauty Supply LLC network. At the time of this discovery, we immediately engaged a top-tier forensics firm (Verizon) to investigate this security incident. As a result of this ongoing investigation, we have now discovered evidence that fewer than 25,000 records containing card-present (track 2) payment card data have been illegally accessed on our systems and we believe it may have been removed. As experience has shown in prior data security incidents at other companies, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation. As a result, we will not speculate as to the scope or nature of the data security incident.

The new coin - modelled on the old threepenny bit, which went out of circulation with the advent on decimalisation in 1971 - replaces the current offering, which has been around for 30 years.The Royal Mint estimates that three per cent of all £1 coins are now forgeries. Over the past few years, around two million fakes have been removed from circulation every 12 months, at considerable cost to banks and the general economy.Plans for the coin were unveiled as Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne prepares to deliver his Budget today. This morning Osborne tweeted a picture of the coin against his famous red box:In addition to having 12 sides, the proposed replacement will have a bi-metallic construction of two colours and include the Mint's new Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology.The Mint has spent around £2 million on iSIS and claims that it enables not just coins, but the whole cash cycle to be more secure, protecting the public, vending machine operators, retailers, and the wider banking system.The coin will have the Queen's effigy on the 'heads' side, but there will be a public competition to decide the design for the reverse, or 'tails' side.Says Osborne: "With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency."I am particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying tribute to the past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threepenny bit."It's not just Britain's coins which are getting a makeover.

London - Britain plans to replace its one-pound coin in 2017 with “the most secure coin in circulation in the world” as it cracks down on fake currency, the finance ministry said on Wednesday. The design of the current pound coin, which has been in circulation for more than 30 years, leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters, the Treasury said.

“The Royal Mint estimates that about three percent of all one-pound coins, or 45 million, are now forgeries. In some parts of the United Kingdom country, it is as high as six percent.”

The new two-coloured coin, designed to have 12 sides like the pre-decimal three-pence piece or “threepenny bit”, will be armed with the Royal Mint's new Integrated Secure Identification System (ISIS) technology.

ISIS has three tiers of banknote-strength security and can be authenticated via high-speed automated detection at all points within the cash cycle, the Treasury said. - Reuters###1164||NEW YORK — Walmart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Walmart plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Walmart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world’s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It’s a business that’s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world’s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Wal-Mart’s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.

Starting next week, Walmart customers can trade in video games for credit that can be used in both Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. The value for each trade-in will vary by the title, console and age of the game, ranging from just a few dollars for older games to $35 or more for newer ones.

In a wrinkle on GameStop’s program, Walmart made a point on Tuesday of saying that the credit it will offer shoppers can be used on anything from groceries to a new bike, rather than just other video games.

“When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins,” said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer of its U.S. stores. “They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.”

GameStop did not respond to a query for comment.

Investors appeared to think Wal-Mart’s move spells trouble for GameStop, sending its shares down 3.7 percent to $38.30, while Walmart shares rose 14 cents to $74.82.

But analysts suggest the new program isn’t necessarily a death knell for GameStop. After all, other retailers have tried to take business in the used game market with “modest” success, said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian, but GameStop has loyalty among video game customers and a broad inventory of new and used video games.

“History suggests the competition is unlikely to capture meaningful share,” he wrote in a client note.

The trade-in business is appealing for a retailer: When a consumer buys a new video game for $60, only a small portion of its sale price goes to the company. But when a consumer turns around and sells that game back to the company, the company can keep all the profits from the resale.

But it’s also a complex business that requires systems to track and manage used product inventory and pricing and the ability to refurbish products and restock stores appropriately to balance supply and demand. In fact, Walmart tried a video trade-in program from 2009 to 2010 using kiosks in stores, but that was not a success. The company said it has found a better system that will make the process more efficient.

Still, Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said GameStop has advantages that Walmart does not: a large refurbishment facility in Dallas, pricing algorithms and experience developed over a decade.

“It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well,” Bhatia said. “However … buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying one disc at a time from customers.”

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Stephen Colbert said on Monday's Late Show. "It's been very contentious, the polls are incredibly close, and both candidates are spending tens of millions of dollars to win this thing. So I wanted to send a correspondent down there who could deliver a thorough, nuanced report for The Late Show. And coincidentally, my friend Conan O'Brien is on hiatus right now, so he was kind enough to lend us the one reporter who I believe is able to meet those high standards," Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.

Triumph, Colbert explained, was the right dog for the job because he'd tried and failed to grab an interview with Cruz when he was running for president in 2016. "I followed Ted Cruz from Iowa all the way to New Hampshire, and I never got to meet him, despite being the only person in the world who wants to," Triumph told Colbert. This time he had better luck. He ribbed Cruz harder than O'Rourke, but Cruz also made more of an effort to join in on the insult comedy, to mixed effect.###1172||With a major corruption scandal threatening his seat at the top of Turkey’s government, and with national elections less than 10 days away, the country’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, issued a statewide ban on Twitter late Thursday night that sent shockwaves through the country.

Telecom regulators were able to restrict user access, as issued by court order, using a simple DNS block: If a user’s IP address is on the block list, they cannot access the website or service in question. Countries like China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have called for worldwide DNS restrictions before.

Before the ban was enforced, Erdoğan vowed to “eradicate” Twitter from the country in an election speech, apparently after the company had reportedly refused to delete incriminating audio of him instructing his son to dispose of large amounts of cash in the midst of a police investigation. News of the Twitter restriction soon rippled across the Internet, and instructions for skirting the DNS block using VPN (virtual private networks) and Google DNS–both of which change your IP address–quickly spread. Similarly, Twitter issued instructions to Turkish users on how to send tweets using SMS:

While Turkey has blocked services like YouTube before, this is the first time the government has used its authority to block a mobilizing platform like Twitter. Criticism of Erdoğan’s move to stifle the voices of Turkish citizens was swift and cutting. “The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly,” tweeted Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission. “Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.” Turkish president Abdullah Gül also chimed in, perhaps indicatively, from his Twitter account: “The shutdown of an entire social platform is unacceptable,” he tweeted.

In the hours after the social media restrictions were announced, it was reported that almost 2.5 million tweets were sent from Turkey–amounting to roughly 17,000 tweets per minute–setting a new record for Twitter use in the country.###1173||'Bankrupt' exchange Mt. Gox finds 200,000 'lost' bitcoins in old wallet

Washington, Sat, 22 Mar 2014 ANI

Washington, March 22 (ANI): The bankrupt Japanese Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has reportedly said that the company has found nearly a quarter of the bitcoins, previously thought to be lost or stolen, in its disused electronic wallet.

The company located 200,000 bitcoins worth around 485 million dollars in one of its old wallets.

According to the Verge, Mt. Gox said that it now holds approximately 202,000 bitcoins, with 650,000 still missing, warning that the figure missing was still subjected to change along with the suspected reasons for their disappearance.

Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO, wrote in a statement that the reasons for their disappearance and the exact number of bitcoins which disappeared were still under investigation.

Earlier, the firm had filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month, claiming hack attack that led to theft of about 7,50,000 customer bitcoins and 1,00,000 of the firm's own bitcoins. (ANI)###1174||Image copyright AFP Image caption Mulberry shares fell more than 25% after January's profit warning

The boss of Mulberry has quit after two years in charge of the luxury handbag firm.

Bruno Guillon's departure follows a profit warning from the company in January, in which it said results would be "substantially" below expectations.

Mulberry's shares fell by more than 25% as a result and have not recovered.

Mr Guillon will be replaced on an interim basis by former boss Godfrey Davis, who oversaw rapid growth of the brand between 2002 and 2012.

Mr Davis said his predecessor had "improved the quality of the Mulberry offering", and added: "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

The company issued a profits warning within months of Mr Guillon's appointment in March 2012, and in June last year announced the departure of creative director Emma Hill, who had been credited with much of the company's previous success.

Mulberry's latest profit warning earlier this year came after it said retail sales fell over the key Christmas trading period, down 7% in the eight weeks to the end of January.

It said it had experienced "significant" cancellations of wholesale orders from South Korea, and that annual profits would be about £19m, compared with analyst forecasts of £27m.

Mulberry shares rose by 1.26% in early trading on Thursday.###1175||2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame Coins at Introductory Prices

French satellite pictures handed to Malaysian authorities on Sunday show possible debris from the missing Boeing 777, photographed in broadly the same area as objects picked up by Australian and Chinese satellites last week.

A plane scouring the search area, about 2,500km south-west of Perth, spotted a wooden pallet and other objects late on Saturday (UK time), including what looked like variously coloured straps or belts.

However, it was unable to get up close or take photographs, and other aircraft dispatched to the site on Sunday could only see seaweed.

Nonetheless, the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, expressed cautious optimism about a possible breakthrough in the 16-day hunt for the plane, which vanished off civilian radar screens with 239 passengers and crew during a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

"Obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads, and there is increasing hope - no more than hope - that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft," he said.

An Australian aviation expert, Neil Hansford, said he believed there was a "high likelihood" that the satellite photographs show wreckage from the plane.

A Malaysian statement about the French images gave no details about the number, size or precise whereabouts of the objects, merely describing them - in a reference to one of two broad arcs identified as the plane's likely final location - as "potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor".

The photos have been relayed to Australia, which is co-ordinating the search which began last Thursday deep in the southern Indian Ocean, after the first grainy images emerged of objects floating in the churning waters.

One large object, photographed by Australian and Chinese satellites, could be an aircraft wing - or a lost shipping container.

Mike Barton, from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, said wooden pallets were commonly used in the airline industry, "usually packed into another container which is loaded in the belly of the aircraft". Pallets were, however, also used in shipping, he noted. The agency has requested a cargo manifest from Malaysia Airlines.

The eight aircraft searching on Sunday - which included two Chinese Ilyushin IL-76s and two Japanese P2 Orions - focused on two areas covering 59,000 square kilometres.

A marker buoy was dropped at the site where the pallet was spotted so that its movement could be tracked. The air search is being supported by several ships in the area.

Mr Abbott said of the hunt: "We owe it to the almost 240 people on board the plane. We owe it to their grieving families. We owe it to the governments of the countries concerned to do everything we can to discover as much as we can about the fate of MH370."

Relatives are now enduring a third, agonising week of waiting for news.

Wang Zheng, whose parents, Wang Linshi and Xiong Yunming, were among 153 Chinese passengers, told Associated Press in Beijing: "Biggest of all is the emotional turmoil I've been going through. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I've been dreaming of my parents every day."

Mr Wang, whose parents were among a group of Chinese artists touring Malaysia, last spoke with them on the night of their departure, shortly before they boarded the plane. They were filling out exit cards at the airport, and told him they would call him on their arrival in Beijing.

Like other relatives, he is praying that the possible debris turns out to be a false lead - meaning that his parents could still be alive.

"I will stay here until they give me an answer," he said, speaking at a Beijing hotel where families attend daily briefings. "I am not leaving until I know for certain where my parents are."

The search will resume again tomorrow, but the threat of bad weather still looms, with a cyclone reported to be heading towards the search area at the moment, which will cause difficult conditions with strong winds, though it is expected to lose its strength over the next few days.

Today the Telegraph reported the investigation into how the plane carrying 239 people on 8 March went missing is becoming increasingly centred on the two pilots, following an extensive analysis of data from the plane.

According to senior sources involved in the investigation, the paper reports that authorities remain certain the disappearance of flight MH370 was a result of a "deliberate act" by a "person or persons on board".

Malaysian police have denied reports in the Mail Online that the missing flight's Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah received a two minute phone call from a woman before take-off.

The woman is supposed to have bought a pay-as-you-go phone to make the call with fake ID and the paper claims the discovery raises fears of a possible link between the Captain and terrorist groups who use untraceable SIM cards.

Assistant commissioner Datin Asmawati has called the claims "mere speculations."

He said: "Please be advised that the Royal Malaysia Police take no responsibility over the dissemination of such information which originates from unnamed and unverified sources."

"Secondly the IGP has never issued any public statement that categorically places the MH370 investigation under any act of terrorism," he added.

AMSA said it had refined the search based on the latest clue from the Chinese satellite showing an object that appeared to be 72 feet by 43 feet, when it started its mission today. It said the object's position also fell within yesterday's search area but it had not been sighted.

Yesterday's search was split into two areas within the same proximity covering 22,800 square miles. These areas have been determined by drift modelling, the AMSA said.

Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein put a message on his Twitter account asking those in churches around the country to offer a "prayer please" for the passengers and crew on Fight 370.###1177||You are the owner of this article.###1178||Empty###1179||###1180||Pound declines to almost 5-week lows against dollar

Investing.com - The pound dropped to nearly five-week lows against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as markets were jittery following reports armed gunmen stormed a Ukrainian military base in Simferopol, although mixed U.S. economic reports did little to support the greenback.

hit 1.6552 during U.S. morning trade, the pair's lowest since February 12; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.6567, retreating 0.42%.

Cable was likely to find support at 1.6426, the low of February 12 and resistance at 1.6666, Monday's high.

The risk-related pound weakened after CNN reported that Vladislav Seleznyov, Ukraine's defense ministry spokesman, said at least one Ukrainian officer had been injured in an assault on a base by "armed people in masks" near the Crimean capital of Simferopol.

Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia isn't seeking "a partition of Ukraine", signaling that Russia's moves in Ukraine would be limited.

The comments came during a speech to a joint session of parliament in Moscow, a day after the president recognized the results of Sunday's referendum in Crimea, which saw a majority of voters chose to split from Ukraine.

The European Union and the U.S. have declared the vote illegal and imposed sanctions.

In the U.S., data showed that the annual rate of inflation slowed to 1.1% in February from 1.6% in January. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to decline to 1.2%. Month-on-month, U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in February, in line with forecasts.

Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the number of building permits issued in the U.S. rose to a four-month high in February, rebounding after a sharp drop in January.

The number of building permits issued last month jumped 7.7% to 1.018 million units following a 16.8% fall in in January, as a result of severe winter weather.

However, U.S. housing starts fell 0.2% last month to hit a seasonally adjusted 907,000 units, disappointing expectations for an increase of 3.4% to 910,000 units.

Sterling was lower against the euro, with rising 0.32% to 0.8395.

Also Tuesday, a report showed that German economic sentiment deteriorated in March, as concerns over the crisis in Ukraine weighed.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported that its index of German economic sentiment fell to 46.6 this month from February’s reading of 55.7. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 53.0.###1181||Empty###1182||BANGALORE (Reuters) - Stock markets in China and other parts of east Asia will reverse a downtrend that began last year and rise for the rest of 2014, a Reuters poll showed, driven by attractive valuations and as the global economy gains traction.

However, gains are likely to be weaker than expected in previous polls in December.

Since May last year, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first said that it intended to reduce its asset buying, many bourses in emerging markets have seen a huge sell-off.

China's Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has lost close to 5 percent so far this year, adding to a 7 percent fall in 2013. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI has fallen almost 7 percent and South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 about 4 percent.

But the sell-off has pushed stock valuations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea well below their 5- and 10-year averages, measured by their 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios, making them cheaper and lucrative for investors.

The poll, conducted in the past week, showed analysts expect the Shanghai index will rise almost 18 percent to 2,380 points from Wednesday’s close of 2,021.73.

The Hang Seng index will be almost 15 percent higher at 24,750.

Korea's Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) is expected to gain close to 13 percent and Taiwan's TAIEX .TWII about 4 percent.

Although the consensus is for those indexes to gain from current levels, the median forecasts are much lower compared to a similar survey in December.

The Fed is widely expected to end its massive stimulus program later this year, which could lead to investors pulling out of emerging markets.

However, for east Asian stocks the key factors will be China’s health and how the global economic recovery takes shape.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last week warned the world’s second-largest economy is facing “severe challenges” this year after growth in investment, retail sales and factory output data slumped to multi-year lows.

But analysts are more upbeat as they expect a recovery in developed economies to drive demand for exports from the region.

“Much of the negative noise about global economic growth is expected to dissipate by the fourth-quarter, allowing the local market to follow the global market’s upward trend,” said Kwak Hyun-soo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.###1183||The world’s largest retailer will begin taking consumers’ old video games in exchange for gift cards on March 26. Wal-Mart said its new service will allow customers to trade in games for credit they can use to shop for other goods in stores or on the company’s website, walmart.com. The program will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart stores nationwide.

Wal-Mart executives said the service will accept an unlimited number of games for consoles such as the Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo Wii so long as they are in original packaging and undamaged. The trade-in value—which could be used to by anything from groceries to gasoline—will range from a few dollars to $35, depending on the title’s age. Customers must be 18 years or older to participate, the company said.

The retail giant is hoping to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market. Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer, told CNNMoney, the company estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” he said.

Indiana added 4,600 net new workers, using seasonally adjusted data. Other states with the most manufacturing hiring in January were Missouri (up 2,500), Ohio (up 2,400), Minnesota (up 2,000), and New York (up 1,900).

Michigan added the most manufacturing workers over the past 13 months (up 18,100), assisted by strength in the recovering auto sector. Other states with the most net manufacturing job growth since the end of 2012 included Indiana (up 14,500), Ohio (up 10,000), Florida (up 10,000), and Wisconsin.

North Dakota continues to have the lowest unemployment rate in the country (2.6 percent), followed by Nebraska (3.5 percent), South Dakota (3.6 percent), and Utah (3.9 percent). North Dakota’s low unemployment rate is the result of the explosive growth in shale exploration in that state in recent years. Meanwhile, Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate in January at 9.2 percent, with Illinois and Nevada close behind at 8.7 percent each.

February sate employment numbers will be released on March 28.

ANKARA - Anadolu Agency does not verify these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

Turkish dailies on Friday covered Thursday’s attack on Turkish security forces in central Turkey, which killed three people including a police officer and a soldier.

HURRIYET headlined “Assassination team,” claiming three gunmen, who departed from the southern province of Hatay, were heading to Istanbul to attack critical targets. They mounted an assault on Turkish soldiers when they were caught during a routine check on a highway in Nigde province. A police officer, a soldier and a civilian were killed while five others were wounded.

“Assad terror in Nigde,” headlined TURKIYE, commenting that the Turkish army prevented a possible attack masterminded by the Syrian regime. The newspaper reported that two "terrorists" were captured by the police, while one of them succeeded in fleeing.

Daily VATAN said two Al Qaeda-affiliated gunmen were caught at the hospital while carrying German passports.

Turkish dailies also covered the block implemented late Thursday on access to social media website Twitter, hours after Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of such an action.

Daily RADIKAL cited Turkish PM Erdogan saying at a local election rally on Thursday, “The court took the decision. I am not interested in what the international community say, we will wipe out Twitter.”

"Twitter was blocked at midnight," carries daily HURRIYET’s headline.

Daily TURKIYE also covered Erdogan’s rally in Bursa, recounting Erdogan's remarks that Turkey faces "international conspiracies" on social media and Twitter will be "eradicated."

The find that could provide some relief to the scandal hit exchange.

Time reported the bitcoins were found in an old-format wallet, previously thought to be empty. The two hundred thousand bitcoins that were found on March 7 may help the exchange weather the crisis caused after it had "lost" 850,000 bitcoins. Following the loss, the exchange filed bankruptcy.

According to a letter dated March 20, posted on Mt Gox's website, the company decided to scan all old wallets.

"Following the application for commencement of a civil rehabilitation proceeding, these wallets were rescanned and their balance researched. On March 7 MtGox Co confirmed that an old­ format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC," it said.

"For security reasons, the 200,000 BTC were moved from online wallets between March 14 and 15 to offline wallets," the letter further stated.

The company said in the letter the total number of bitcoins originally presumed to be lost have now come down by 200,000. The exact number of coins that disappeared, though, is under investigation and the figures may change.

Financial Times pointed out Mt Gox was seeking a debt restructuring of $64 million.

Reuters said that several creditors were skeptical about the Mt Gox's explanations of how the bitcoins had vanished. It also expressed reservations over the find from a plaintiff who filed a class action against the exchange agency. The judge in Chicago overseeing the matter allowed for tracking of bitcoin exchange.

Steven L. Woodrow, one of the partners at Edelson representing the plaintiff, said, "Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we've been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it 'found' these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins."###1203||Empty###1204||Every year, people fall prey to tax scams. That’s why the Internal Revenue Service distributes a list of its annual Dirty Dozen tax scams. The IRS wants the public to be safe and informed — and not become a victim.

Taxpayers who get involved in illegal tax scams can lose their money, or face stiff penalties, interest and even criminal prosecution. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be on the lookout for these scams:

1. Identity theft

Tax fraud using identity theft tops this year’s Dirty Dozen list. In many cases, an identity thief uses a taxpayer’s identity to illegally file a tax return and claim a refund.

For the 2014 filing season, the IRS has expanded efforts to better protect taxpayers and help victims.

2. Pervasive telephone scams

The IRS has seen an increase in local phone scams across the country. Callers pretend to be from the IRS in hopes of stealing money or identities from victims.

If you get a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS, and you know you owe taxes or think you might owe taxes, call the IRS at 800-829-1040.

If you get a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and know you don’t owe taxes or have no reason to think that you owe taxes, then call and report the incident to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration at 800-366-4484.

3. Phishing

Phishing scams typically use unsolicited emails or fake websites that appear legitimate. Scammers lure in victims and prompt them to provide their personal and financial information.

The fact is that the IRS does not initiate contact with taxpayers by email to request personal or financial information. This includes any type of electronic communication, such as text messages and social media channels.

4. False promises of inflated refunds

The bottom line is that you are legally responsible for what’s on your tax return, even if someone else prepares it. Scam artists often pose as tax preparers during tax time, luring victims in by promising large tax refunds.

Taxpayers who buy into such schemes can end up penalized for filing false claims or receiving fraudulent refunds. Take care when choosing someone to do your taxes.

5. Return preparer fraud

About 60% of taxpayers will use tax professionals this year to prepare their tax returns. Most return preparers provide honest service to their clients. But some dishonest preparers prey on unsuspecting taxpayers, and the result can be refund fraud or identity theft.

Choose carefully when hiring an individual or a company to do your return. Only use a tax preparer that will sign your return and enter their IRS Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN).

6. Hiding income offshore

While there are valid reasons for maintaining financial accounts abroad, there are reporting requirements.

American taxpayers who maintain such accounts and do not comply with these requirements are breaking the law. They risk large penalties and fines, as well as the possibility of criminal prosecution.

The IRS has collected billions of dollars in back taxes, interest and penalties from people who participated in offshore voluntary disclosure programs since 2009. It is in the best interest of taxpayers to come forward and pay their fair share of taxes.

7. Impersonation of charitable organizations

Taxpayers need to be sure they donate to recognized charities. Following major disasters, it’s common for scam artists to impersonate charities to get money or personal information from well-intentioned people.

Scammers may even directly contact disaster victims and claim to be working with the IRS to help the victims file casualty loss claims and get tax refunds.

8. False income, expenses or exemptions

Falsely claiming income you did not earn or expenses you did not pay in order to get larger refundable tax credits is tax fraud. This includes false claims for the Earned Income Tax Credit.

These taxpayes often end up repaying the refund, including penalties and interest or faces criminal prosecution.

9. Frivolous arguments

Frivolous schemes encourage taxpayers to make unreasonable and outlandish claims to avoid paying the taxes they owe.

While taxpayers have the right to contest their tax liabilities in court, no one has the right to disobey the law or ignore their responsibility to pay taxes.

10. Using a false Form 1099

Filing false information with the IRS is an illegal way to try to lower the amount of taxes owed. Typically, fraudsters use a Form 4852 (Substitute Form W-2) or a “corrected” Form 1099 as a way to improperly reduce taxable income to zero.

The fraudster may also submit a false statement denying wages and taxes reported by a payer to the IRS.

11. Abusive tax structures

These abusive tax schemes often involve sham business entities and dishonest financial arrangements for the purpose of evading taxes. The schemes are usually complex and involve multi-layer transactions to conceal the true nature and ownership of the taxable income and assets.

The schemes often use limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, international business companies, foreign financial accounts and offshore credit/debit cards.

12. Misuse of trusts

There are reasonable uses of trusts in tax and estate planning. However, questionable transactions also exist.

They may promise reduced taxable income, inflated deductions for personal expenses, the reduction or elimination of self-employment taxes and reduced estate or gift transfer taxes.

These trusts rarely deliver promised tax benefits. They primarily avoid taxes and hide assets from creditors, including the IRS.

Tax scams can take many forms beyond the Dirty Dozen. The best defense is to remain vigilant. Get more information on tax scams at IRS.gov.###1205||Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Morning Glory's evasion of a naval blockade led to the sacking of the PM

The US says it has returned the rogue oil tanker Morning Glory to the Libyan government.

The North Korea-flagged ship had been loaded at a rebel-held port and evaded a naval blockade before being boarded by US Navy Seals south of Cyprus.

Its evasion prompted parliament to sack Prime Minister Ali Zeidan.

The US said it had handed over the ship, cargo and crew to Libyan forces in international waters off the coast of Libya.

Rebels had loaded the Morning Glory with oil at the port of Sidra. It was unclear where it was heading.

It was the first vessel loaded at a rebel-held port since a separatist revolt against the central government in Tripoli erupted in July 2013.

'Smoothly'

Rebels under Ibrahim Jathran hold three ports, and are demanding a greater share of the country's oil revenue.

Earlier, the Lana state news agency reported clashes between his fighters and Libyan troops in his hometown of Ajdabiya.

The US embassy said in a statement that the handover of ship, cargo and crew had gone "smoothly and as planned".

It added: "We have been assured by the government of Libya that the captain, crew members and Libyan nationals who were aboard the stateless tanker will be treated humanely in accordance with internationally recognised standards of human rights."

The Navy Seals operation had been authorised by President Barack Obama and no-one was hurt.

The vessel was flagged in North Korea but officials in Pyongyang said it had been deregistered because of the incident. It was said to have been operated by an Egyptian company.

The Libyan government is still struggling to assert its authority on rebel groups that helped to overthrow Col Muammar Gaddafi.###1206||Get daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

Today's Budget will include at least one money-making scheme for Wales, with the Royal Mint at Llantrisant ready to roll out the replacement for the £1 coin.

The new £1 will have the same 12-sided shape of the “threepenny piece” which vanished with decimalisation in 1971.

According to the Royal Mint, about 3% of all £1 coins (or 45 million) are now forgeries. The present £1 has been in circulation for more than three decades – much longer than the lifetime of a typical coin – and is prey to counterfeiters.

The new “bi-metallic” two-colour coin should be introduced in 2017 and will be roughly the same size as the £1 coin, and the Royal Mint – which developed the technology at its South Wales base – is confident it will be “the most secure coin in the world”.###1207||Global outcry over Turkey’s Twitter ban

ISTANBUL

Global organizations and the international media have reacted strongly to Turkey’s decision to block Twitter. Here are some of the reactions:“Efforts to shut down Twitter in order to control the news are not only ultimately futile – they sadly move Turkey away from the embrace of human rights and the rule of law, and closer to autocracy. It’s been said that censorship is the lobby of dictatorship. What’s the point of democracy if you won’t give voters the possibility of making an informed decision?”"We call on Prime Minister [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan to stop his vitriol against social media in the country and focus on ensuring that all information platforms are free to function freely in advance of local elections. Turkish authorities must stop viewing the media as the enemy and embrace the role of a free press in a democratic society."“This is another fundamental blow to freedom of expression in Turkey and the right to access information, and the closure order should be immediately lifted. The move further signals that the Turkish government has taken an anti-democratic turn which significantly sets back its human rights record.”“Erdoğan had faced perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office when unidentified critics began using Twitter and YouTube to leak dozens of phone calls and documents that seemed to tie government officials and business circles close to the government to a graft inquiry that began last December. One of the recordings purports to be of the prime minister himself telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of Dec. 17, 2013, when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr. Erdoğan has repeatedly — and angrily — insisted that the recording was fake.”“Erdoğan’s showdown with Twitter has been long coming. In mid-2013, thousands of protests ripped across Turkey ostensibly in opposition to a proposed urban development of Istanbul’s Taksim Gezi Park. But many say that discontent was more rooted in the government’s shift away from secularism – Erdoğan is Muslim — and its recent crackdown on freedom of press and expression.”“Twitter use breaks new record in country as Turks defy purge of social media platform by Ankara.”“Erdoğan says he doesn’t care what the international community will say about the blocking of Twitter.“Wiretapped recordings incriminating Erdoğan have been leaking online for the past few weeks. Now Erdoğan reacts. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government criticized Turkey saying the ban did not fit with Germany’s view of freedom of expression. ‘What we are hearing from Turkey does not comply with what we in Germany understand as free communication,’ said Mrs. Merkel’s spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz.”“This is an attack on the freedom of thought. Only dictators could dare it.”“Turkey blocks Twitter, is Russia next? Twitter had agreed to cooperate with Russian courts, so, a possible blockage in Russia would be softer than in Turkey.”“Erdoğan is doing it to prove his power.”“Turkey PM blocks Twitter after it became awash with evidence of government ‘corruption’ ahead of elections...but his President tweets on!”###1208||Toyota agrees to billion-dollar settlement with U.S. government over 'unintended acceleration' problems with some of its most popular vehicles

The deal protects Toyota executives from criminal prosecution



Justice Department lawyers investigated whether Toyota misled investigators looking into its handling of complaints of acceleration issues

General Motors currently is being investigated over similar complaints

Toyota and the federal government reportedly are about to announce a settlement to the tune of $1 billion following a Justice Department probe of how the automaker handled customer complaints about unintended acceleration the company at one point attributed to faulty floor mats.

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office began investigating allegations that the Japanese automaker misled federal authorities in 2009, after complaints about the unintended acceleration became a source of controversy.

The agreement allows Toyota to avoid any potential criminal charges that could be brought against employees in the future, and requires the company to shell out a $1 billion fine.



Unintended acceleration: Toyota initially tried to resolve the issues with the cheap fix of replacing floor mats

Deal: U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has slapped Toyota with a $1 billion fine for its handling of acceleration issues in some of its most popular vehicles

The agreement was first reported by CNN.

'Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years,' a Toyota spokeswoman told the cable news network. 'During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.'

Bharara's office and the Justice Department declined to comment on what for now is only a planned announcement.

For years, Toyota responded to complaints about acceleration issues in some of its most popular models by doing little more than changing floor mats.



Recall: Toyota was forced in 2009 to issue a massive recall of some of its most popular vehicles

In 2009-10, the car company was forced to recall millions of vehicles after it became clear that floor mats were not the main cause of the many cases of unintended acceleration problems.



In addition to Toyota, motor vehicle regulators were criticized for how they responded to the acceleration issues the company was having leading up to the massive recall.



Following the recall, Toyota executives were forced to appear in two Congressional hearings, at which lawmakers criticized their response to complaints regarding acceleration issues with some of the company's top-selling models.



Next: Bharara also is investigating similar claims made against General Motors

In addition to the agreement with the Justice Department, Toyota has agreed to similar settlements with state governments, as well as car owners.

The settlement with Toyota comes as the Justice Department begins a probe into safety issues with General Motors vehicles.

###1209||Symantec's top executives fielded questions from employees on Friday about the abrupt ousting of CEO Steve Bennett, and said the company would focus heavily on bringing new products to market as the board of directors seek a new chief executive.

In an interview with CRN on Friday, Stephen Gillett, Symantec's executive vice president and chief operating officer and driver of the company's recently recalibrated channel activities, said the board of directors decided it was time to return to growth in an accelerated fashion to meet market demands. Symantec's focus moving forward will be to execute on product innovation and bringing new products to market, Gillett said.

Symantec's board of directors appointed Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer on Thursday, in an move that shocked many Symantec employees, including Gillett. Brown is accomplished at being a stabilizing presence, according to Gillett, who said he will be a knowledgeable leader and organizer during the company's transition.

Brown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with storage giant Veritas Software in July 2005. Gillett said he worked with Brown in 2012 during his tenure on the company's board of directors.

"[Brown] will be focused on keeping forward momentum and not stalling as we focus on product activities and accelerating growth," Gillett said.

Gillett, who joined Symantec in December 2012 after holding senior executive positions at Best Buy and Starbucks, has a deep technical background, having worked in information technology nearly his entire career. He said the Symantec's engineering teams have all the pieces in place to build out the portfolio and bring new products to market.

When Bennett took the helm in July 2012, he did a lot of streamlining at Symantec via his Symantec 4.0 strategy, including making the company's product teams report directly to him. Bennett has previously told CRN that move was aimed at boosting productivity and accelerating innovation, but Gillett said Symantec's board of directors didn't feel this would enable the the company to bring new products to market quickly enough.

Gillett said the "apparatus and cadence that allows development cycles to be met happen regardless of who is at the top operationally."

Under Brown, Symantec's project engineering, technical support and research and development activities will all be getting more attention, Gillett said. Symantec's executive team is working on a revised list of priorities for its fiscal 2015 strategy and product roadmap, he said.

"The organizational structure, in reporting to Steve, did little in the way of blocking or changing dramatically the progress we're making in the product roadmaps, integrating our point products combined with new technology development," Gillett said. "There is nothing I see or know that will be coming that should be cause for any concern for our progress to change."

Gillett urged partners to be patient as the board of directors conducts its search for a new CEO. He said he is an advocate of the channel, having procured goods and services from partners. A consistent effort is being made behind the scenes in transforming Symantec into a channel led organization, Gillett said. "That importance of that effort has been reinforced to me by our interim CEO," he said.

Symantec partners tell CRN that they have welcomed the organizational changes and say its time to reveal more details about the company's newly integrated product offerings. Time will tell how this will work out for Symantec, said John Woodall, vice president of engineering at Integrated Archive Systems (IAS), a Palo Alto, Calif.-based solution provider and Symantec channel partner.

"We'll have to wait for Symantec 5.0," Woodall said. "We'll need time to see how the company does. But whoever comes in to replace Bennett will have to define the company's strategy quickly and communicate its plans. This market is too volatile on too many levels."

Symantec is not going away, Woodall said. "It's a strong company. For us now, it's business as usual."

The reasoning behind this costly move? It's less-easy prey for counterfeiters, supposedly.

While introducing a new coin will cost the country an undisclosed amount to create, Osborne has said that the new design will cut down on fraud, said to cost us millions each year, thanks to its Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) tech. The Royal Mint actually thinks that around 45 million £1 coins, in our pockets and down the backs of sofas, are actually forgeries.

Lest you think Osborne's gone and put his own face on one of the coin sides, the Queen's visage is still on the "head" side of the coin, but it's up to us -- the commoners -- to decide what makes it to the "tails" side.

The Tennessee Valley Authority is improving the timeliness with which is handles complaints from its non-nuclear staff, but a new audit of worker concerns found "some employees feel that concerns are not being adequately addressed and reported experiencing pressure and repercussions from management."

In a report released Monday, TVA's Inspector General recommends that TVA identify an individual to audit and assess employee concerns after the cases are closed. The IG also thinks TVA needs to do a better job of investigating claims of retaliation by managers against workers who voice concerns. TVA management agreed to implement better programs.

Jobless rate falls in U.S.

Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January, including Tennessee and Georgia, as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state -- Iowa -- where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month.

Rates were Alabama and five other states and declined from 7.9 percent to 7.7 percent in Tennessee and from 7.6 percent to 7.4 percent in Georgia. The national jboless rate in Janaury was 6.6 percent.###1215||Sally Beauty confirmed Monday that hackers broke into the supplier’s network, stealing the payment data of up to 25,000 customers.

The information stolen included payment card numbers and the three-digit security codes, known as CVV numbers, the company said. The retailer said it does not store customers’ personal identification numbers (PINs).

Customers will be notified if their information was stolen, said Sally Beauty, which is advising shoppers to check their bank statements for suspicious transactions. The company did not provide details on the nature of the breach, including whether it affected only shoppers who came into a store or also those who shopped online.

The confirmation follows a statement by Sally Beauty this month that said it detected a breach Feb. 24 but had no evidence that customers’ data had been stolen. The breach was first reported by security blogger Brian Krebs.

Krebs wrote that Sally Beauty probably had been attacked by the same hackers who stole more than 100 million customers’ data from Target.

Sally Beauty said that it was working with Verizon Enterprise Solutions and the Secret Service to investigate the breach.

“As experience has shown in prior data security incidents at other companies, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation,” the company said in a statement. “As a result, we will not speculate as to the scope or nature of the data security incident.”

A spokeswoman for Verizon Enterprise Solutions confirmed that the company was investigating the breach but did not provide details.

The attack makes Sally Beauty the latest retailer in the crosshairs of hackers. In addition to Target, Neiman Marcus and Michaels also suffered data breaches last year. The attacks have sparked debates in Washington on updating the nation’s breach notification laws and its payment systems.

Sally Beauty sells and distributes professional products in more than 2,700 stores across the country. The Texas-based company has $3.6 billion in annual revenue.###1216||The consulting arm of Denver Relief, a cannabis grower and retailer in Colorado's capital, today announced that Laura Harris, former director of the state Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED), has joined the firm as a regulatory adviser. Harris, who took over what was then the Medical Marijuana Enforcement Division in late 2011, retired last August after 30 years of working for the revenue department. In an email message that was leaked to The Denver Post, Harris said she had planned to stay at the MED until mid-2014, after the newly legal recreational pot stores were up and running, "but I found that the personal toll of this job was too much." She added that "I found that I was becoming ineffective with my colleagues at those times when it was necessary to address areas of disagreement."

When I interviewed Harris for my 2013 Reason cover story about legalization in Colorado, I found her to be refreshingly candid. Although Colorado's medical marijuana regulations were widely cited as a model for other states, she made it clear that they were largely arbitrary and difficult to enforce. She questioned the rule requiring dispensaries to grow at least 70 percent of their inventory (which applies to recreational stores until this October) and the practicality of developing child-resistant packaging for cannabis-infused foods. "The current code is extremely difficult to regulate," she said. "What you will hear from many in industry is that this works. Well I'm not as optimistic about it working. If it worked, we would be able to present evidence of how the model works toward good enforcement." This was two months before the state auditor released a report that was sharply critical of medical marijuana regulation in Colorado.

Harris, who worked as a revenue agent and a criminal investigator before becoming Colorado's chief cannabis regulator, had a pretty steep learning curve. "Even in college,," she said, "I did not partake. I can say that honestly. I had friends in law enforcement. My first husband was in law enforcement, which was the environment in which I was raised. My perception of what marijuana was when I came into this division is the little flowers in the baggie that I had seen others carry around." A year or so later, she had learned "much more about the canabis plant, much more about the theory around its medicinal effects and much more about what is actually extracted from the plants other than the flower—the resin and all the products that are created from the resin. So yes, its been very educational."

Now Harris will be educating others—not about the plant so much as the often baffling rules surrounding its use. "It's exciting to be able to bring my expertise on cannabis regulation to Denver Relief Consulting, a firm that has demonstrated a commitment to establishing a responsible model for the entire nation to follow," she says in a press release. "As more states follow Colorado's regulatory lead, both in medical and retail cannabis, it is imperative that individual governments have a framework in which to work so that there are no unintended consequences." Harris' transition is yet another sign that marijuana is becoming an industry like any other, faster than many of us anticipated.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Wal-Mart will soon let consumers trade in their old video games for gift cards that they can then use to shop for items in its stores or on walmart.com.

The world’s largest retailer said its new video game trade-in service kicks off on March 26 and will roll out in more than 3,100 Wal-Mart discount stores nationwide.

The retailer said the service will accept unlimited number of games for popular consoles, including Sony Playstation, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s XBOX as long as they aren’t damaged and are in their original packaging.

After they bring in the games, consumers will get an eGift card which they can use to shop for groceries at Wal-Mart, jewelry on walmart.com or even for gas at Sam’s Club locations.

The trade-in value of the games will vary from a few dollars to about $35, depending on their age. Some games considered to be too old will not be accepted. The service is available only to customers 18 and older.

Wal-Mart said it will refurbish the video games, label them as “Certified Pre-owned,” and sell them later this year in stores and on its website.

Wal-Mart wants to tap into the $2 billion pre-owned video game market, said Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising and marketing officer. The retailer estimates that there are nearly 1 billion unused video games sitting in homes across the United States. “We’re not part of it at all. We expect to grow the market even more now because of our entry into it,” he said.

The latest trade in program follows Wal-Mart’s other recent similar initiatives. Last fall it launched smartphone and ipad trade in programs.

“This is a new category for us. We’re doing it because our customers have asked us for it,” said Mac Naughton.

Bank Rossiya, and its biggest shareholder Yuri Kovalchuk, were included in a new wave of punitive measures by Washington targeted at Putin's close allies over the crisis in Ukraine.

Gennady Timchenko, who also made a list of 20 new names hit by the U.S. sanctions, is another shareholder in the bank. He is one of the founders of Gunvor, one of the world's largest independent commodity trading companies.

Kovalchuk holds a 40.3 percent stake in Bank Rossiya, while Timchenko has 7.9 percent, according to regulatory filings.

Putin, mocking the measures by Washington, played down his association with the bank, but ordered the central bank to support the lender.

“And as for the financial institution (Bank Rossiya): as I understand, it is a medium-sized bank,” he told a meeting of Russia's Security Council. “I personally don't have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday.”

Later he said he would transfer his wages to the bank.

Little has been known about Bank Rossiya, which has risen to become the country's 15th largest bank by assets last year from 54th in just six years.

Kovalchuk, the largest shareholder in the St Petersburg-based bank is a close Putin ally. The friendship between the two dates back to the early 1990s, when Putin served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

Kovalchuk was also one of the three founding members of the Ozero (Lake) luxury dachas complex outside St Petersburg who were targeted by the U.S. sanctions

“Kovalchuk … Timchenko … I think I need to stay away from them,” Putin joked on Friday.

The bank's operations are concentrated around St Petersburg and Moscow, serving chiefly clients in oil, gas and energy. The bank also controls large insurance firms Sogas and SK Transneft.

The bank, according to its latest financial report, for 2012, served 24,000 corporate clients. Those included a significant portion of Gazprom's businesses, primarily through Gazprom Mezhregiongaz and Gazprom Energy Holding.

“Our companies will continue using the services of the bank,” a spokeswoman for Gazprom Mezhregiongaz said on Friday.

According to the bank's most recent balance sheet sent to the central bank, its assets grew by an annual 33 percent as of Oct. 1, 2013 to 401.7 billion roubles ($11.10 billion). The bank's corporate resources base grew by 40 percent during that time to 327.9 billion roubles.

The bank paid 106.5 roubles ($2.94) per ordinary share in dividends on 2012 earnings for a total payout of 267.1 million roubles ($7.37 million), suggesting that Kovalchuk got $1 million in dividends for his stake.

According to a 2008 article by the business daily Vedomosti, nearly 4 percent of the bank belonged to a distant cousin of Putin, Mikhail Shelomov.

One of the bank's clients, the state electricity holding firm InterRAO is run by Kovalchuk's son Boris Kovalchuk.

“We have small rouble deposits and an insignificant loan burden, in both roubles and foreign currency, but settlements for the latter are made in roubles,” Anton Nazarov, a representative of InteRAO told Reuters, without disclosing the amounts.

Three of the bank's clients, the utility holdings FSK , Moscow United Electric Grid Co. (MOESK) and the grid company Rosseti, told Reuters they hold only rouble accounts at the bank.

Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at the lender and its subsidiary Sobinbank following Washington's sanctions. Western Union the world's largest money transfer company, has also suspended its services for the bank.

“The bank has a strong liquidity cushion and the imposed sanctions will not affect the company's operations,” Bank Rossiya said in a statement late on Friday.

“Currently, there is no area (of the bank's operation) that would require assistance from the Central Bank.”

The Russian central bank said that it stood ready to support the sanctions-hit bank. “If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in support of the credit institution and reliable protection of the interests of its depositors and creditors,” it said in a statement.###1220||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- You only get so long to perform a turnaround. Steve Bennett -- who was replaced as the CEO of the computer security software company Symantec (SYMC) on Thursday -- probably thinks that 20 months was not long enough. But the company's board were not convinced. As they wrote in a statement that was released after the market close Thursday:

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."

When Bennett joined Symantec, its shares were below $15. During his tenure as CEO, the stock rallied as high as $27, as investors initially agreed with his efforts to streamline and reorganize Symantec's product range -- including Norton anti-virus software -- as well as to cut costs. The last two quarterly corporate disclosures, though, have disappointed the market. This appears, at first glance, to have had some influence.

So what should investors think?

The shares are down today to levels last seen over a year ago. As of 11:30 a.m., they're trading at $18.02, down 13.8% for the day. Year to date, the stock is down 23.4%.

Yet the cyber security sector appears to be as attractive as ever. Businesses and consumers, on both their networks and electronic devices, only have a greater need for security over time. That's why companies like Check Point Software (CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) have had such strong stock prices recently.

Clearly, though, something is not right with Symantec. Accompanying the disappointing recent quarterly results have been a series of resignations (and appointments) to the management team.

My instinct is that Steve Bennett's desire -- as expressed in the last quarterly results conference call in January -- to "continue to drive improved efficiency and better resource allocation across the company" has upset too many of the company's employees. The approach likely lost the support of the other board members. Combine this with a poor last couple of quarters, and this led to yesterday's end to his CEO tenure.

But Symantec still has a lot going for it. Despite all its recent troubles, Symantec still has strong brands like Norton. It continues to generate free cash. Plus, at the current share price, it has a dividend yield of nearly 3%. It has more than $700 million of outstanding share buyback capability and has net cash on the balance sheet of well over $1 billion. That's significant for a company with a market capitalization of under $13 billion. That will have caught the eye of other companies, including those in private equity.

Longer-term technology sector watchers may remember that Intel (INTC) purchased Symantec's peer McAfee a few years ago.

Given the importance of cyber security to both businesses and individuals, Symantec's troubles and weak share price present a prime time for investors to do their due diligence. It's time to act. Embrace the volatility and consider Symantec shares now, when they're on sale.

Putin spoke after President Barack Obama ordered a second round of sanctions targeting about two dozen members of Putin’s inner circle and a major bank supporting them. Moscow made its first retaliatory shot by banning nine U.S. officials and lawmakers from entering Russia.

Putin said in televised remarks at Friday’s session of the presidential Security Council that he sees no immediate need for further Russian retaliation and said sardonically that he would open an account in the Russian bank targeted by the latest U.S. sanctions.

Meanwhile, Russian stocks tumbled Friday as another credit rating agency put the country on notice of a possible downgrade and Visa and MasterCard stopped serving two Russian banks.

Fears over Russia’s economic outlook have ratcheted up this week after Putin signed the treaty to annex Crimea following Sunday’s hastily called referendum which overwhelmingly supported that move. The West considers the vote illegitimate.

The MICEX benchmark was down nearly 3 percent two hours into Friday trading with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.

As Russian stocks were taking a pounding, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”

And clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.

The bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.

Though customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops or online or even withdraw cash from ATMs, the clients can get cash directly from the banks.

Russia’s central bank sought to assure that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. authorities “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.” However, it added that the government could “take necessary steps to support the lender and the interests of its depositors and creditors.”

Amid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.

Fitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status. Lower ratings are important because it can make a country’s borrowing costs more expensive.

“Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support,” Fitch said.

Share###1222||WASHINGTON, D.C. (March 19, 2014 – CNN) — The Justice Department is set to announce as soon as Wednesday a billion-dollar agreement with Toyota to settle a federal probe of the automaker’s handling of customer complaints related to unintended acceleration, people familiar with the deal said.

The investigation led by the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has examined allegations that the Japanese automotive giant initially misled federal authorities after the complaints became a source of controversy in 2009.

Under the settlement, Toyota is expected to avoid criminal charges and is expected to pay about $1 billion, those familiar with the agreement said.

“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,” a Toyota spokeswoman said. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”

The Justice Department didn’t comment on the planned announcement.

Toyota recalled millions of cars in 2009-10, after years of doing little beyond changing floor mats in response to complaints to federal auto safety regulators about acceleration problems in popular models.

Regulators were also criticized for their handling of the matter in the years leading up to the massive recalls.

Top company executives came under fire in two congressional hearings during that time in which lawmakers accused Toyota of not doing enough to respond to safety concerns. Stiff safety fines were imposed by the Transportation Department.

Toyota has settled similar allegations in agreements with a group of states, and has also paid settlements to some Toyota car owners.

The Toyota agreement comes with Bharara’s office just starting to look into a safety issue at General Motors. The FBI, which conducted the Toyota probe, is now gathering evidence on the GM complaints.

GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem. GM engineers apparently knew about it years ago but the Detroit automaker did not move to recall vehicles until last month.###1223||There’s a reason that the administrators of Obamacare haven’t revealed how many people who have enrolled were previously uninsured: They don’t know.

Enrollees in the federal exchange and most of the 15 state exchanges are not asked if they had insurance before signing up, CNBC reports.

“All applicants who are seeking subsidies must answer questions about future access to insurance, but they are not asked about prior or current coverage,” the network reports on its website.

CNBC surveyed the state exchanges and 12 of the 15 replied. Of those, only Kentucky and New York ask applicants if they previously had insurance.

Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said it should have been obvious that whether those signing up are uninsured would be a common question.

"A lot of people could have anticipated this is a question everyone would be asking," she said. But it’s still understandable that the information isn’t being collected as program administrators single focus is on signing people up before the March 31 enrollment deadline, not conducting research or an evaluation, she told the network.

This satellite photo was obtained by a Chinese Earth-observation satellite on March 18, 2014 and released by the country's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense on March 22.

A Chinese satellite orbiting Earth has captured a new photo of possible debris from the missing Malaysian Airlines jet that disappeared with 239 people aboard earlier this month.

The new Chinese satellite photo was captured by one of China's Earth-observation satellites on Tuesday (March 18) and released today (March 22) by China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND). The image shows a large object in the southern Indian Ocean, according to a translation of the image description.

SASTIND officials said the object is about 72 feet (22 meters) by 43 feet (13 m). It was spotted about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southwest of the location of another possible debris sighting by an Australian satellite earlier this week, they added. [Facts about Malaysia Flight 370]

The new satellite photo is the latest clue in the ongoing search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 jet that disappeared on March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Since the disappearance, the search effort has focused on two vast arcs, one stretching north from Malaysia up toward Kazakhstan in Central Asia, and another stretching south across the Indian Ocean.

After an initial search of the potential debris location from the Australian satellite came up empty, search teams are now studying the Chinese satellite photo lead, according to press reports. Search and recovery ships are headed to the location to search for any debris, Malaysia Ministry of Defense officials said.

The Associated Press reported today that two Chinese military planes arrived in Perth, Australia to join Australian, U.S. and New Zealand aircraft in the search. Search flights on Saturday also yielded no signs of the missing jet, and it is unclear if the search area will be changed in the wake of the new Chinese satellite photo, the AP reported.

Updated

The hunt for debris from Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 off the coast of Western Australia shifted north today, as Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said Australia was "clutching at whatever little piece of information comes along" in the search for the missing plane.

The shift to an area some 850 kilometres north of the weekend's search zone came after French satellites spotted "floating debris" in the ocean.

Speaking to Radio National this morning, Mr Truss said the overall search area had now been extended to cover 68,000 square kilometres.

"Certainly the areas where debris has been picked up by satellites is of particular interest, and they're the focus of a lot of the searching," Mr Truss said.

"The French sighting is a piece of new material because that is in a completely different location. That is about 850 kilometres north of our current search area.

"So we need to check that out as well."

Malaysia's transport ministry said the French images showed "floating debris" and said they had been sent to Australian authorities coordinating the search.

But Malaysia gave no details of the number, size or precise location of the objects.

Mr Truss said the debris in the French images was not in an area authorities had identified as the most likely place where the aircraft may have entered the sea.

"We still don't know for certain that the aircraft is even in this area," he said.

"We are just clutching at whatever little piece of information comes along to try and find a place where we might be able to concentrate the efforts."

He also said Tropical Cyclone Gillian, near Christmas Island, could bring bad weather south, hindering search efforts.

"It is a very difficult task. The weather yesterday wasn't too bad, although there was early morning fog," he said.

"Today we expect the weather to deteriorate and of course the forecasts ahead are not all that good.

"So it's going to be a challenge but we'll stick at it."

The pilot of one of the Royal Australia Air Force Orions involved in the search said conditions had been challenging.

Flight Lieutenant Russell Adams said there had been heavy cloud cover and his crew was not able to spot any debris.

"We're working directly with Rescue Coordination Centre Australia as one small cog in this giant effort," he said.

"We're going out there for two, three hours at a time, so the satellite imagery is going through the centre and we've been tasked appropriately through them.

"As per the effort that my crew's putting in we couldn't be more proud of the boys and girls."

No sign of debris in challenging search conditions

Flight MH370 went missing on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard, including six Australians.

Authorities last night completed a fourth day of sorties into the search zone, where they are now also searching for an object that China identified yesterday as being 22 metres long and 13 metres wide.

The object was spotted about 120 kilometres south-west of two possible objects seen on satellite images taken on March 16 and announced by the Australian Government on Thursday.

The Chinese satellite images were taken on March 18 by the high-definition Earth observation satellite Gaofen-1.

Eight aircraft were involved in yesterday's search and the Royal Australian Navy's HMAS Success was also in the area.

Chinese and Japanese military aircraft are due to arrive in Perth today to help.

Australian Air Force Commander Craig Heap says it is fantastic to have two Japanese P3 Orion planes helping with the operation.

"We have worked many times with the JMSDF (Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force) over the years, especially the P3 crews," he said.

"They are highly professional and they'll bring a tremendous capability to this operation.

"They bring a P3 which is an extended range, specifically designed for maritime patrol.

"They're also extremely professional aviators."

On Saturday, a civilian plane reported sighting a number of small objects close together in the search zone.

A P3 Orion aircraft flew over the area but could see nothing but seaweed.

The Orion dropped a marker buoy to track movement of the material and a merchant ship has been sent to locate and identify it.

Speaking from Papua New Guinea yesterday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said one of the objects was reported to have been a wooden pallet.

"Obviously we have now had a number of very credible leads and there is increasing hope, no more than hope, that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen," he said.

Malaysia has enlisted 25 other countries to help hunt for the plane.

First posted###1230||A new 12-sided one pound coin based on the threepenny bit, said to be the hardest in the world to fake, is set to be announced by George Osborne in his Budget today.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, also known as the 'Threepenny bit', which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain an array of technological advances making it difficult to forge.

As well as a 'bi-metallic' construction similar to the existing £2 coin, the new £1 will also feature new banknote-strength security pioneered at the Royal Mint's headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales.

A Treasury spokesman said: "After 30 years loyal service, the time is right to retire the current £1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

"With advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it's vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

"We are particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying a fitting tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic Threepenny bit".

But Labour's Cathy Jamieson poured scorn on the announcement: "I think people are going to be worried about how many pounds they’ve got in their pocket, rather than the shape of it," she said.

Royal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence hailed the "exciting project", adding: "The current £1 coin design is now more than 30 years old and it has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiting over time.

"It is our aim to identify and produce a pioneering new coin which helps to reduce the opportunities for counterfeiting, helping to boost public confidence in the UK's currency in the process.

"We're extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint's Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost."

As with all coins, the Queen's effigy will be on the "heads" side, but the Treasury has said there will be a public competition to decide the design for the 'tails' side.

A Bank of England spokesman added: "Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank's decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency."

But many have already taken to Twitter to voice their scepticism surrounding the release of the new coin – with some speculating that it is a distraction as the Chancellor announces his Budget.###1231||Empty###1232||Walmart Plans To Accept Video Game Trade-Ins

(NEW YORK) - Walmart plans to expand its video game trade-in program to its stores, offering store credit for thousands of video games.

The world's largest retailer plans to let video game owners trade in used video games online and in Walmart and Sam's Club stores for store credit but not cash. Previously they offered trade-ins on a more limited basis online.

It will also offer refurbished used games in its stores for the first time. Walmart has been seeking new ways to boost revenue as its low-income customers remain under pressure due to a weak jobs picture and shaky economy. In its most recent fourth quarter, net income dropped 21 percent, and the Bentonville, Ark.-based company gave a subdued forecast for the current year.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

In a call with journalists, Walmart executives said CE Exchange, the company that partnered with them on their trade-in program for smartphones and tablets launched in the fall, will also be in charge of the new video game program.

The value for each trade-in video game will vary by the title, console and age of the game. The amount will range from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.

Amazon, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and others also offer video game trade-in programs that offer store credit or cash for video games.

The new money would catapult Airbnb into the ranks of the world’s most valuable start-ups, along with the likes of WhatsApp, which was snapped up last month by Facebook for $19 billion, and Dropbox, the online storage provider that was recently valued at $10 billion.

Airbnb operates by putting travellers seeking a place to stay in contact with people with a house or room to rent.

BRUSSELS, March 20 — EU member states and the European Parliament reached an accord today on a new regulatory system designed to prevent a failing bank from wrecking the economy.

Parliament had opposed an agreement reached in December by EU leaders on how to close down a bank in trouble, saying it was too unwieldy, but the European People’s Party said these differences had now been resolved.

The EPP, the biggest party in parliament, said the process would be speeded up so as to ensure that a problem bank can be closed down in the space of a weekend to avoid markets turmoil on a Monday.

“This is very good for restoring confidence in European banks,” said the EPP’s Corien Wortmann-Kool, one of the lead negotiators in the marathon talks.

“Problem banks should be treated within a weekend. This is a big plus of this agreement; a year ago we clearly saw that the extensive talks on Cypriot banks raised the costs.”

The agreement will also reduce what the EPP said was “undue political interference” in the procedure.

“This ensures that banks are treated in the same way across Europe, in whichever country they are located. This is a guarantee that painful but necessary measures are really put into practice. This is much fairer,” a statement said.

European Parliament head Martin Schulz is expected to make a formal announcement shortly, with the deal reached just as EU leaders arrive in Brussels for a summit.

Reaching agreement on banking union was essential to allow time for full approval before the parliament breaks up for elections in May.

In December, EU leaders agreed to set up a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to close failing banks in a safe and orderly fashion.

The SRM will work alongside a new regulator, run by the European Central Bank, that is set to supervise the Eurozone’s 130 biggest banks starting in November.

But because closing down a bank is a costly and politically charged step, EU leaders set up a decision-making structure which gave them the final say.

Parliament objected strongly and warned it could not accept a formula which allows “political power games” when closing a bank requires speed and effectiveness.

Parliament was also unhappy with the plans for an accompanying fund, paid for by the banking industry, saying its phasing-in period of 10 years was too long. — AFP###1240||The is stable on Tuesday, as the pair trades slightly above the 1.39 line in the European session. The markets are following fast-moving events in the Ukraine, as Crimea has voted to join Russia and the EU and the US have responded with limited sanctions. Turning to economic news, German ZEW Economic Sentiment looked awful, sliding to a ten-month low. The Eurozone indicator also slipped badly. As well, the German Constitutional Court confirmed the legality of the European Stability Mechanism. In the US, there are two major events on the schedule - Core CPI and Building Permits.

Events are moving quickly in the Ukrainian crisis. Voters in Crimea voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in Sunday's referendum, and Russian Prime Minister Putin has recognized Crimea as an independent state, paving the way for annexation. Putin will address a special session of the Russian parliament on Tuesday. The EU and US have responded with targeted sanctions, freezing assets of several high-ranking Russian officials. Additional sanctions are expected, possibly as early as this week.

US releases looked weak on Friday. PPI posted a decline for the first time since November, coming in at -0.1%. The estimate stood at +0.2%. Preliminary UoM Consumer Sentiment dropped below the 80-point level for the first time since November, slipping to 79.9 points. This was short of the estimate of 81.9 points. The weak PPI points to persistently low inflation numbers, which is indicative of an underperforming economy. Recent US numbers have certainly not dazzled, but they should be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to go ahead with another taper of QE. This would be the third trim of the Fed's asset-buying scheme, and would reduce QE to $55 billion per month. These tapers are dollar-positive and mark a vote of confidence in the US economy by the Federal Reserve.

The European Stability Mechanism, which is the Eurozone's bailout fund, was confirmed as legal by the German Federal Constitutional Court on Tuesday. Germany is the biggest contributor to the EUR 970 billion fund. In February, the court deferred a decision on the Outright Monetary Transactions, which is credited with saving weak members of the Eurozone, to the European Court of Justice.

Sales figures from Colorado in the first month of legal sales alone, show that financial impact will probably make the marijuana market compete if not dwarf the amount spent on alcohol by Colorado consumers in its first year out of the gate. Approximately 37 marijuana stores across the state of Colorado estimated close to $5 million in sales during their first week in business. The 30 day figures saw a whopping $14 million in profit from the same and generated $2 million in tax revenue. Sales have been so brisk, they are now on track to reach as much as $1 billion by the end of this year just in Colorado alone.

What this will mean for bank regulation is an issue now of concern if not ongoing discussions by the federal Justice Department with financial establishments in both Colorado and Washington state, expected to follow Colorado's lead in legalizing recreational marijuana sales later in the summer of 2014.

The business climate, although flying high at the moment, still has much ground to cover even as the marijuana space gains strength in motion and organizes itself along the lines of a traditional business lobby and presence.

The uncertain legal environment, if not novelty of legal sales, however, has predictably had an impact on the first joyous days of the green rush, although prices are also widely expected to drop, if not potentially the high sales tax levy on the same. The tax structure will remain in place, however, according to state legislators instrumental in crafting them, until there is a better understanding of the market.###1245||WASHINGTON — All but one of the nation’s 30 largest banks are better able to withstand a severe U.S. recession and global downturn than at any time since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

The only bank to fail the Fed’s annual “stress test” was Zions Bancorp, parent of Vectra Bank Colorado. Vectra Bank is the state’s seventh-largest bank, with deposits of $2.15 billion and an active small-business lender.

Zions, based in Salt Lake City, lacked the minimum level of capital the Fed deemed necessary to withstand a crisis after it booked hefty charges last year related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items. The bank’s director of investor relations was unable to comment before publication.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during a severe recession.

Under the Fed’s stress tests’ “severely adverse” scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment — now at 6.7 percent — would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That’s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year’s tests.

The 30 tested banks included some of Colorado’s largest: Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.

Gox found 200,000 forgotten bitcoins, a week after the online currency exchange filed for bankruptcy claiming that all its bitcoins had been stolen, the company said in a statement Thursday.

Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said that the bitcoins were found in an old electronic wallet that the company had previously believed was empty and was last used in June 2011. Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy on Feb. 28, stating that it had lost all of its 850,000 bitcoins, said that it moved the newly-found bitcoins into offline wallets due to “security reasons.” The discovery of the bitcoins was made known to the courts, lawyers and other authorities, the company said.

“Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC (balance of bitcoins), the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC,” Mt. Gox said in the statement.

When the company filed for bankruptcy, it had said that, due to a technical issue, its customers were able to make fraudulent withdrawals on the exchange. While Mt. Gox claimed it had fallen victim to a technical problem due to which one of the largest exchanges of the digital currency had to declare bankruptcy, others had speculated about the possibility of fraud on the exchange’s part.

On Thursday, a U.S. judge in Chicago, supervising a lawsuit against Mt. Gox, revised a previous order and allowed some of the exchange's bitcoin movements to be tracked.

"Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we've been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it "found" these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins," Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at law firm Edelson, told Reuters.

Jonathan Waller, an investor who develops bitcoin-related projects said, according to Financial Times: “It’s good they’ve found some of the Bitcoins but I think it was a badly run system which lost control of their Bitcoins."

Earlier in March, the Japanese government had struggled to explain how the world’s largest bitcoin exchange lost about nearly a billion units of the digital currency. A London-based firm, Selachii LLP, also filed a lawsuit against Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, raising further doubts about the exchange's claims of a hack.

Last week, Karpeles’ Reddit account and his personal blog were breached and the hackers claimed that they found some discrepancies in the number of bitcoins deposited compared to the number of bitcoins that Mt. Gox claimed was stolen.

The hackers claimed that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox’s accounts while the exchange reported that 750,000 bitcoins belonging to its clients and 100,000 bitcoins of its own had been lost in the hack.###1248||What if I told you Pinterest has over 70 million users who are more than willing to share your brand and products for you?

Chinese military aircraft will start the search operation for the missing Malaysian jetliner on Monday in the southern Indian Ocean where suspicious debris of MH370 was spotted.Two Chinese Air Force Ilyushin IL-76 planes will head toward the search area early Monday and provide relevant information for Chinese naval search vessels, Commander Liu Dianjun said Sunday.The two planes will fly from RAAF Base Pearce to Perth and, after refuelling, will leave for the sea area in the southern Indian Ocean where objects possibly related to MH370 were spotted by satellites.Liu said the Chinese aircraft will make a roughly eight-hour round-trip flight during their first search mission, with the furthest point 2,700 km away from Perth.Wang Quansheng, captain of one of the two IL-76 planes, said his crew members are preparing the plane to take more fuel so that it can search a wider area for a longer time.The international hunt for MH370 shifted to the southern corridor after Australia said Thursday that satellite imagery identified suspicious debris in the southern Indian Ocean.The Malaysian aircraft mysteriously disappeared from radar en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 with 239 people on board.###1252||The Royal Mint, it seems, is admitting defeat on the battle with fake £1 coins and will, after 30 years, reinvent the coin as a new 12-sided coin, the "most secure circulating coin in the world".

Around 3pc of all £1 coins, of 45 million in circulation, are now forgeries up from 1pc or 15 million a decade ago.

The figure had risen from 2.74pc to 3.04pc in the last survey alone, in November.

Most of us only discover we have one when we go to put them in a parking meter and find they are rejected, others are more obvious.

The pound coin, made from a mixture of copper, zinc and nickel, was introduced in April 1983 to replace the £1 note.

Fake coins are largely made of lead and then sprayed with gold paint. This means that the weight often feels different to genuine pound coins and the surfaces are notably different.

The Royal Mint warns of warning signs:

• The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year). A list of designs and dates is available here.

• The lettering or inscription on the edge of the coin does not correspond to the right year.

• The milled edge is poorly defined and the lettering is uneven in depth, spacing or is poorly formed. The obverse and reverse designs are not as sharp or well defined.

• Where the coin should have been in circulation for some time, the colouring appears more shiny and golden and the coin shows no sign of age.

• The colour of the coin does not match genuine coins.

• The orientation of the obverse and reverse designs is not in line.

What do I do with a fake coin?

Vigilance in the first place is your only hope. You decline a fake pound when it's given to you. It is an offence to try and pass the coin on. In theory, they should be handed to the police.

Banks will not refund those left holding fakes. This can be very costly for small shopkeepers who take their till takings to branches.

Based on the 3pc prevalence of fakes, nearly all of us will be handling at least a few fakes each year, often without knowing.

How does our fake problem compare with elsewhere?

The 5 rand coin in 2004 was reissued after taxi-drivers and shopkeepers in South Africa started to refuse to accept them. Fakes were just 2 per cent of all coins.

Previous estimates of euro coins suggest they are far harder to counterfeit. Only 0.1pc of euros – some 10m – were fakes, according to research in 2006. Fakes are more prevalent among €2 coins, the European Commission said last year.

Why will the new £1 coin be better?

The Mint said the new 12-sided coins will be made from two different coloured metals – as yet to be decided – and contain an "iSIS security feature". This is to do with the Integrated Secure Identification System developed by the Mint. It applies this existing security technology "that has been proven over decades in banknotes" to coins for the first time. Those are the only details released. The coins will enter circulation in 2015.

• Ask a question: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk###1253||The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration is warning taxpayers to beware of phone calls from individuals who claim to represent the Internal Revenue Service, but in reality are trying to defraud them, in what it is saying is the largest ever scam it has seen to date.

“This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen,” said TIGTA Inspector General J. Russell George in a statement. He noted that TIGTA has received reports of over 20,000 contacts and has become aware of thousands of victims who have collectively paid over $1 million as a result of the scam, in which individuals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials.

“The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming,” said George. “At all times, and particularly during the tax filing season, we want to make sure that innocent taxpayers are alert to this scam so they are not harmed by these criminals. Do not become a victim.”

George urged taxpayers to heed warnings about the sophisticated phone scam targeting taxpayers, noting that the scam has hit taxpayers in nearly every state in the country. Callers claiming to be from the IRS tell intended victims they owe taxes and must pay using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. The scammers threaten those who refuse to pay with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver’s license.

The truth, TIGTA pointed out, is the IRS usually first contacts people by mail—not by phone—about unpaid taxes. The IRS also won’t ask for payment using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer, and the agency won’t ask for a credit card number over the phone.

“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” said George.

The callers who commit this fraud typically use common names and fake IRS badge numbers, TIGTA noted. The scammers also frequently know the last four digits of the victim's Social Security Number make the caller ID information appear as if the IRS is calling, making the scam even more convincing. In addition, they tend to send bogus IRS e-mails to support their scam, and call a second time claiming to be the policy or department of motor vehicles, and the caller ID again supports their claim.

TIGTA said that if you receive a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS asking for a payment, here’s what to do. If you owe federal taxes, or think you may owe taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you with your payment questions. If you don't owe taxes, call and report the incident to TIGTA at 800-366-4484. You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at www.FTC.gov. Add "IRS Telephone Scam" to the comments in your complaint.

TIGTA and the IRS are encouraging taxpayers to be alert for phone and e-mail scams that use the IRS name. The IRS said it will never request personal or financial information by email, texting or any social media. Taxpayers who received scam e-mails should forward them to phishing@irs.gov, but they should not open any attachments or click on any links in those emails.

Taxpayers also should be aware that there are other unrelated scams (such as a lottery sweepstakes winner) and solicitations (such as debt relief) that fraudulently claim to be from the IRS.

March 18 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc will allow U.S. shoppers to trade in used videogames for anything from groceries to gadgets, a move that could dent the profit of GameStop Corp, the largest dealer of used videogames.

GameStop shares fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading, making it one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wal-Mart said on Tuesday its trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony Corp’s PlayStation3 and Microsoft Corp’s Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy anything at Walmart and Sam’s Club.

“Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we’re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity,” Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The move would pit Wal-Mart against retailers such as Best Buy Co and Target Corp, besides GameStop, which also have trade-in programs for used videogames. Such games are refurbished and sold later.

While GameStop would be unlikely to lose market share, the company would be forced to go into a price war to both buy used games and to sell the refurbished games, according to Stifel analyst David Schick.

“We know that WMT “invests in price” ... and we expect GME will match an increasingly competitive marketplace to protect (market) share,” Schick wrote in a note to clients.

GameStop has already warned of sagging sales of games played on older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Sales of videogame products such as consoles have been pressured by lower-priced online offerings and as gamers spend more time on tablet computers and phones.

GameStop shares were down 5 percent at $37.82 in late morning trading on Monday, while Wal-Mart shares were up marginally at $74.87.

The new mayor told reporters today that the city’s bike-share program, reportedly bleeding money, will probably not be getting any public dollars to help fill its coffers.

“At this moment, that’s not in our plans,” said Mr. de Blasio, responding to a question about whether the city would aid the privately-financed program at an unrelated press conference today. “We want to see what we can do help them back on their feet using other methodologies.”

Despite their popularity in some neighborhoods and their ballyhooed–if delayed–roll-out under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Citi Bike continues to lose money, according to today’s Wall Street Journal. The report cited poor weather, rising operational costs, damage to equipment during Hurricane Sandy and unexpectedly low usage by tourists as reasons for the bike share’s financial struggles.

Unlike bike-share programs in other cities, Citi Bike receives no public money. All revenue is raised through membership fees, corporate sponsorships and advertising. Polly Trottenberg, the city’s new transportation commissioner, has left the door open to a possible price hike, but is in discussions with the company about other options.

“What Commissioner Trottenberg was doing is sitting down with the folks from Citi Bike and saying, ‘What would help in terms of the way things are structured now, what would help you financially, with all the other possibilities that may be there?” Mr. de Blasio said. “We’re open to any proposal they have. Again, at this moment, city budget money is not on the table but we’re open to other alternatives.”

The mayor, when pressed, further said he would be open to state or federal funding to keep the bikes running.

“If we can find that, that certainly would be great,” he said. “But the point is I think it’s a valuable service, it’s proven to be a success, we want to see it continue, we want to see it expand and we’re going to work with them to find alternatives.”###1257||As the age of video games ages, so do the number of discarded and unused video games, probably. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), the world’s largest retailer, means to take advantage of that via a video game trade-in program. Since Walmart is among the store chains that sells video games and consoles, the decision almost certainly will add to the revenue from this business.

The company announced:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

The plan, therefore, allows Walmart to sell the refurbished games at a discount to new ones, which could bring in a new group of customers who need or want to pay less for their gaming.

The consumer’s effort to take part is easy:

Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.

Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.

The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.

The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam’s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com.

About 3,100 Walmart stores will participate.

Walmart is taking a last bite at an aging industry, which may not exist in its current form just years from now. The success of consoles made primarily by Sony Corp.’s (NYSE: SNE) PS4, Microsoft Corp.’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) Xbox One and Nintendo have been undermined by the rise of the tablet and smartphone. And traditional video games have been replaced to some extent by ones that can be downloaded from app stores, primarily those controlled by Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Some company has to take advantage of the end of an era. It might as well be Walmart, which has the customers, stores and online base to do so.###1258||Empty###1259||Empty###1260||You are using an older browser version.

Gox, the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy this month after it said it lost 750,000 of its users currency, just reported that it found 200,000 bitcoins that were found in an “old-format wallet.”

For you kids at home dealing in old school, E Pluribus Unum kinda legal tender, that’s referring to a digital storage file kind of wallet, not the old leathery kind.

In a message posted Friday on the exchange’s website, Mt. Gox’s former chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said ”Mt. Gox Co., Ltd. had certain old­format wallets which were used in the past and which, Mt. Gox thought no longer held any bitcoins.”

But on March 7, Karpeles wrote, the exchange “confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC.” That still doesn’t account for all of the amount that was unaccounted for, plus another 100,000 of Mt. Gox’s own bitcoin reserve. Total value at the time: $450 million. Based on current rates, it is worth about a quarter of that.

Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, told The New York Times that Mt. Gox probably overestimated how much bitcoin it had misplaced.

“I think that it’s yet another illustration of how incompetently managed that hobbyist operation was,” said Luria, who has written about bitcoin. “That you can lose that much bitcoin and then find it tells you that we’re not talking about robust levels of security and control.”###1262||Empty###1263||Security software maker Symantec Corp (SYMC) Wednesday shunted out its Chief Executive Officer Steve Bennett and named Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

The company did not divulge any reason for the removal of Bennett but said its priority is to find a leader who can drive propel innovation and growth at the company.

The announcement sent Symantec shares tumbling 9 percent in after-hours trade on the Nasdaq.

In a statement, Symantec said the exit of Bennett follows an ongoing deliberative process and was not due to any event or impropriety. Bennett also resigned from the Symantec board.

Symantec said a special committee of the board will begin the search for a permanent CEO.

Incoming CEO Brown joined the Symantec board after its merger with Veritas Software in July 2005.

Earlier Brown served as chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp and more recently has been a board chairman and CEO coach for firms prior to their acquisitions, including EqualLogic and Echo Nest.

Brown also will remain on the Symantec board, but will cease to serve on its Compensation and Leadership Development Committee or Nominating and Governance Committee.

Symantec reaffirmed its guidance for the fourth quarter, projecting net earnings of $0.29 to $0.31 per share, adjusted earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share and revenue of $1.615 billion to $1.655 billion.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $0.42 per share on revenue of $1.64 billion for the quarter.

Symantec, which makes Norton anti-virus software, has laid off workers and streamlined its to soften the impact of weak PC sales that have impacted demand for its anti-virus software. The company has been battling with falling sales for the past quarters.

Earlier this month Symantec named Thomas Seifert as chief financial officer. Seifert was previously the CFO at Brightstar and AMD (AMD).

Symantec stock closed Thursday at $20.91, up $0.33 or 1.58%, on a volume of 5.5 million shares on the Nasdaq. In after hours, the stock $1.91 or 9.11% at $19.00. In the past year, the stock has traded in the range of $20.01 - $27.10.

Business News###1264||Empty###1265||Joining the likes of GameStop, Best Buy and Target, Wal-Mart has announced that it's entering the used video games market, allowing customers to trade in pre-owned games in exhange for anything in-store or online, be it groceries, gadgets or whatever.

Set to roll out across 3100 stores in North America from March 26th, Wal-Mart will accept games for trade-in credit that can be used in Wal-Mart branches and Sam's Club, be it in-store or online. Traded games will be refurbished and made available to buyers.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned videogame opportunity," said Wal-Mart US Chief Merchanising and Marketing Officer Duncan Mac Naughton in a statement.

(NYSE: GME) has had a challenging time from attacks on its business on all fronts — online sales, freemium games versus premium games, and big-box retail efforts. Now its shares were getting bruised on Tuesday on news that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is directly targeting the GameStop model with a new push with its trade-in service and preowned game offerings.

Walmart said in its press release that it wants to offer the 110 million-plus gamers in the United States a new way to unlock value in their current purchases and to save on video game spending. Walmart said:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam’s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

Walmart even said that it is “actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity.” And as far as the GameStop targeting, the company may not have been named directly but Walmart said:

When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They’ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.

What matters here is that some 3,100 stores will participate, and even more importantly that the credit can be used on the purchase of any merchandise at Walmart and Sam’s stores. GameStop’s used vide game turn-in credit for customers is for GameStop purchases.

As far as what the market thinks about the new competition, it isn’t pretty. GameStop shares were down more than 5% and were still down closer to 4.4% at $38.00 on last look.

GameStop shares have traded in a 52-week range of $24.89 to $57.74, and the consensus price target prior to this news was just above $50.00.

So, can GameStop survive this effort? Most likely yes, but with some pain and competition.###1268||Twitter is working to restore service to Turkish citizens on Friday, after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan blocked access to the microblogging social network earlier this week.

“We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform,” Twitter’s policy team said in a tweeted statement. “We hope to have full access returned soon.”

The ban came shortly after anonymous users posted audio clips of what could be incriminating evidence of Erdogan and other top Turkish officials engaging in corruption — clips that emerged just days before key local elections in the country. Erdogan apparently used a court order to command Turkey’s telecommunications authority to block Twitter use within the country, though many have found easy ways to circumvent the ban and access the service.

Turkish President Abdullah Gul spoke out against Erdogan’s actions — in a series of tweets, appropriately enough — claiming that suppression of the service should occur only if citizens’ personal freedoms were being violated. The White House also issued a statement on Friday railing against Erdogan’s ban.

“We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association,” the White House said in a statement. “We have conveyed our serious concern to the Turkish government, urge Turkish authorities to respect the freedom of the press by permitting the independent and unfettered operation of media of all kinds, and support the people of Turkey in their calls to restore full access to the blocked technologies.”

Turkish citizens are no strangers to censorship; in the past, government officials have blocked access to YouTube for offensive comments against leadership at the time. This is the first time Twitter — a company that prides itself on providing a free-speech platform for people around the world — has been blocked in the country.

Currently, however, Facebook has not been blocked by the Turkish government. Facebook declined to comment when asked if it had received any takedown requests from Turkey. A senior Turkish official told Reuters that the government had no plans to block Facebook or other social networks.###1269||Empty###1270||× No Debris Discovered in Latest Search for Missing Plane

(CNN) — The location where a Chinese satellite captured images of a large floating object was within Saturday’s search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, but searchers did not find anything, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.

Officials will now consider the new Chinese images as it plans its search for Sunday.

Early Saturday morning, China released satellite images showing a large object floating in the southern Indian Ocean and sent ships to verify, the Malaysian transport minister said Saturday.

The object was said to be 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide (74 feet by 43 feet).

China later said the satellite images showing the “suspected floating object” were captured four days ago, on March 18.

The floating object was said to be about 77 miles from where earlier satellite images spotted floating debris.###1271||Empty###1272||When President Obama first launched sanctions against a handful of Putin "cronies," the markets laughed at how weak they were.

Nobody's laughing at Obama's sanctions now.

The Russian stock market is tanking today, as the MICEX is down 3.7% 2.0% in early going. This comes after Obama introduced sanctions against a new round of Russian officials, as well as a key bank used by Putin's cronies, Bank Rossiya.

One thing that's making the sanctions sting is that Visa and Mastercard have announced they're freezing the accounts of cardholders at that bank.

The ruble is also falling.

The other big move today is that the Shanghai Composite finally caught a strong bid, with stocks rising 2.7%.

Meanwhile, U.S. stocks are slightly higher.

"By end of year, we project earnings of over $1 million per month with the ad-supported version of Angry Birds," Rovio CEO Peter Vesterbacka told TechCrunch.

The iPhone version of the game costs money, but the Android version is self-published and free. The game makes money off ads it serves up to the user. The Android version of the game has been downloaded over five million times from the Android Market. Vesterbacka also told TechCrunch that the Angry Birds series has an 80 percent retention rate, based on the number of players that return to download updates.

Source: GI.Biz###1274||NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Symantec's (SYMC) board has terminated Steve Bennett as president and CEO after less than two years at the software maker's helm, it announced after market close. The company has appointed Michael Brown as interim president and CEO.

Shares of Symantec were off 6.72% to $19.50 in extended trading.

Bennett's departure comes just 20 months after he took the company's reins from Enrique Salem. The former Intuit (INTU) CEO vowed to breathe new life into Symantec, which had long been criticized for poor execution. Last January he announced his turnaround plan for the company, which involved streamlining, a complete shift in the company's sales coverage model and a focus on 10 core areas, including information-security services, security gateways, data-center security and storage.

In November, however, he acknowledged that he underestimated the impact of the massive restructuring effort. Nonetheless, he said that he remained confident in his turnaround plan.

Symantec shares have fallen 14.83% over the last 12 months. In January, the company was downgraded by Morgan Stanley, which noted potential sales disruption from Symantec's transition.

"We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness," said Symantec chairman Daniel Schulman, in a statement released after market close. "These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17."

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," added Schulman.

Bennett also resigned from Symantec's board on Monday.

Brown joined Symantec's board in 2005 following the company's merger with Veritas. Previously, he was the CEO of Quantum corporation. "With recent key hires, we have a leadership team in place that is capable of accelerating our growth and I look forward to working closely with them to help execute the next phase of the company's transformation plan," said Brown, in the Symantec statement. "The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market."

A special committee of the board will immediately begin the search for a permanent CEO with the assistance of a "leading executive search firm," according to Symantec's statement.

Symantec also reiterated its fiscal fourth-quarter guidance after market close, forecasting revenue between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion, down from $1.748 billion in the same period last year. Excluding items, Symantec expects earnings between 40 and 42 cents a share, compared to 44 cents a share in the prior year's quarter.
