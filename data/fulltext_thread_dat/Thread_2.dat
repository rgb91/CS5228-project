An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth 201 million US dollars (£120 million).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a 100 million dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a 201 million dollar hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a "well-known billionaire".

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: "He wants his next of kin to keep working hard."

He said the annual premium is in "the low single digits of millions of dollars". He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances's firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Mr Frances refused to discuss identity of the policyholder, and Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.##2179|China’s rapid growth has dragged hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it’s also had one very nasty side effect – a massive increase in pollution.

Until recently, most Chinese were happy to accept more pollution in return for faster growth. In any case, the political system left them with little choice.

But over the past few years there have been increasing protests about conditions. And with growth now slowing, people will have more time to get angry about the downsides of the country’s economic transformation.

A popular revolt is the last thing the communist leadership wants. So last week, premier Li Keqiang declared a “war on pollution”.

This will have a major impact on several industries. So how can you profit?

A pack-a-day cigarette habit – even for non-smokers

China’s most visible problem is its poor air quality. The problem is that China gets over two-thirds of its energy from coal.

Coal plants emit a lot of sulphur and soot. When this combines with vehicle exhaust and pollution from factories, it produces smog. According to official statistics, all but three cities in the whole of China breach international air quality standards.

Nowhere is this problem more obvious than in Beijing, China’s capital, which is regularly covered in smog for days at a time. During the last spell, which blanketed even the tallest buildings, flights had to be cancelled and factories shut. Similar problems have also been seen in Shanghai, which recently even took the unprecedented step of closing schools.

Things are so bad that some Chinese people wear protective masks, ranging from simple paper filters to industrial grade respirators, as they go about their day-to-day lives. And you can hardly blame them. The World Health Organisation reckons that in 2010, poor air quality contributed to the early deaths of 1.2 million Chinese citizens. And a study by Professor Michael Greenstone of MIT suggests that the effects of living with all that pollution are similar to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.

The air is bad, but the water is worse

China’s air is obviously bad, and a very visible sign of pollution. But experts think its water may be even worse. Thanks to lax or non-existent controls, firms discharge all sorts of waste into rivers without treating it first.

As a result, over half of China’s rivers are classed as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. A fifth are considered toxic. Even ministers call it “grim”.

As with the polluted air, this is having a serious impact on the cities, towns and villages who depend on the water for drinking and washing. One of the most notorious cases is the river Huai. This river is so polluted that villagers living next to its tributaries can’t open their windows because of the smell. They can’t even use the water to irrigate their crops – it poisons them.

The Huai, and other rivers just as bad, has also been held responsible for a string of ‘cancer villages’, where rates of the disease are far above the norm. Water pollution has also been linked with birth defects and mutations.

Alongside air pollution, it is responsible for the third of Chinese children with high levels of lead in their blood – which has been linked with learning problems and criminal behaviour.

The other problem is that China already has too little water to go around. The fact that a large part of its supply is unusable has made this problem far worse. In 200 cities, water shortages are a critical problem.

Fixing the problem – and how to profit

So what will the ‘war on pollution’ involve?

China admits that the problem may take over a decade to solve. But it has already started to tackle the problem, with a major programme announced last year.

Firstly, there will be tougher standards and bigger penalties for polluters who break them. Secondly, there will be more spending on anti-pollution infrastructure, such as ‘scrubbers’ for power plants.

It seems likely that China will follow through on this, too. Apart from worries over popular uprisings, even the most corrupt government official can’t relish the idea of waking up in a penthouse swathed in smog, or of sending their child out to school with a gas mask in their school bag.

There are several ways to profit, and we’ll be looking at them in more detail in MoneyWeek magazine in the near future (if you’re not already a subscriber, you can get your first three issues free here).

But there’s one quite obvious play that we’ve covered a few times recently – and you don’t have to invest in Chinese stocks to benefit from it. The government plans to spend a lot more on nuclear power to reduce reliance on coal. That’s set to have a knock-on effect on uranium prices (which are still at a pretty low ebb). Uranium is also set to benefit from increased Indian interest, and Japan restarting its nuclear power plants. One way to profit is through uranium miner Cameco (NYSE: CCJ), which has large reserves.

The European maker filed an updated F-1 with the SEC, pricing its 22.2 million shares between 21 dollars and 24 dollars, which would value the company to a staggering 7.6 billion dollars.

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

In its updated filing, the company noted that in February 2014, an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

The company announced that Candy Crush Saga, their top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time, as it alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

It has been believed that the main reason to go public could be to get the best possible price from a strategic acquirer.

The report added that the company, behind other popular free-to-play games like Pet Rescue Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Papa Pear Saga and Bubble Witch Saga, would trade as KING on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) when it goes public.##2181|Empty##2182|Empty##2183|We are committed to protecting your personal information and we have updated our Privacy Policy to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new EU regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018.

World markets were upended last week by the first Chinese default on a domestic bond and the prospect of more to come at the same time as evidence mounted that growth in the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The upcoming Chinese data calendar is light but the picture seems clear: Growth in investment, retail sales and factory output have all slumped to multi-year lows, suggesting a marked slowdown in the first two months of the year.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the economy faced "severe challenges" in 2014 and hinted Beijing would tolerate a slower expansion while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable growth in future.

He also flagged the government will allow further debt defaults. Chinese corporate debt has reached unprecedented levels.

Bank America Merrill Lynch has cut its first-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.3 percent from 8.0 and is revising down its full-year estimate too.

There may be a counter response. Sources involved in internal policy discussions told Reuters that the central bank was prepared to cut bank reserves if growth slowed further, though they said action may only happen in the second quarter.

The other motor of world growth — the United States — has a monetary policy meeting to contend with.

The Federal Reserve could use its Tuesday-Wednesday session to sketch out its plan for eventual interest rate rises, in its formal statement or in new chairman Janet Yellen's news conference.

The Fed has signaled the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, but for now the vista is clouded by an unusually harsh winter and its effects on economic data.

Three top Fed officials said on Wednesday that the economic outlook would have to change dramatically for it to alter the pace at which it winds down its bond-buying program, a process which has cause turmoil in emerging markets.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed by Reuters forecast the Fed would lift overnight rates in either the second or third quarter of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier.

RUSSIA AND THE WEST

With Crimeans expected to vote to join Russia in a referendum, U.S. and European Union sanctions on Moscow are set to be imposed.

The EU has drawn up a list of 120-130 senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes. One EU official said it contained the names of generals and others from the top echelons of Russia's military and political establishment.

That will do nothing to help Russia's already struggling economy and, while it probably cannot afford to disrupt its supply of gas to Europe, it could well retaliate in ways that will damage the West.

"Obviously Russia will not back down, so it all points to an escalation," said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

Politically this story dwarfs all others in the world but economically, some perspective is required.

Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, noted that on a purchasing power parity basis China has 15 percent of global GDP, Russia has 3.0 percent and Ukraine 0.4.

But in sum, Anderson said, "the downside risks to the U.S. and global economy from emerging markets should not be taken lightly".

The UK's annual budget, on Wednesday, is always a big set piece but there has been an unusual dearth of leaks and speculation in advance, indicative perhaps of a steady-as-she-goes approach by finance minister George Osborne rather than a grab for votes.

Having put so much political capital into reducing the deficit, to switch tack now at a time that the economy is recovering strongly could be costly.

While the deficit has come down it is forecast to be about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, still much larger than in other big economies in the European Union.

"With his current fiscal plans on track, the chancellor seems unlikely to set out material new austerity measures," said Nick Bate, economist at Bank America Merrill Lynch.

"But at the same time, despite a general election being just over a year away, there seems little scope for significant fiscal loosening, given that the deficit remains so large."##2185|Empty##2186|Wall St closes lower on Asian data

United States stocks closed lower as sluggish economic data from Asia and lingering concerns about the conflict in Ukraine put investors on the defensive.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 16,418.68.

The S&P 500 lost 0.87 of a point, or 0.05 per cent, to 1,877.17, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 4,334.45.

Earlier, Asian and European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said.

Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.

Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said profit-taking was also a factor following gains since early February.

"Stocks have had a pretty good move," Mr James said.

According to the British company, the transaction ‘accelerates [its] unified communications strategy in a key, highly converged European market, providing a significant time-to-market advantage and network reach that is complementary to Vodafone Spain’s ongoing fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) build programme’. Further, Vodafone Group expects to achieve cost and CAPEX synergies with a run-rate of approximately EUR240 million before integration costs by the fourth full year after the deal is completed, equivalent to a net present value of approximately EUR2.0 billion after integration costs.

On the back of the acquisition Vodafone Group has said it sees a significant opportunity to accelerate growth in unified communications products and services by leveraging its distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each company’s customer base. The British outfit estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately EUR1.0 billion.

Commenting on the deal, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao noted: ‘The combination of Vodafone and ONO creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our FTTH build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.’##2189|The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone’s economy.

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.##2190|The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.

The New York Times published an article on Sunday in which it detailed Ackman's meticulous and aggressive campaign to put pressure on lawmakers and other officials to investigate and consequently eliminate Herbalife in order to protect the $1 billion bet he made against the company. The bet came in the form of a short, which only pays off if Herbalife's stock drops.

Herbalife issued the following statement on Monday in response to the article:

"For the past 15 months, Bill Ackman has executed an unfounded, relentless and fraudulent public attack on Herbalife's business model, blasting Herbalife to any media outlet or hedge fund audience willing to listen. As The New York Times reports, Ackman has, out of desperation, shifted his focus from Wall Street to Washington and key states across the country. Ackman's unprecedented campaign to destroy Herbalife has now been exposed for what it is: a cynical, self-serving attempt to manipulate the market by buying his way into an investigation to cover his own reckless $1 billion dollar bet. There has never been merit to his accusations. Now we know how he has been orchestrating the appearance of outrage and concern. There should be no question any longer about Ackman's motives, his techniques and his goals."

TheStreet Ratings team rates HERBALIFE LTD as a "buy" with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

"We rate HERBALIFE LTD (HLF) a BUY. This is driven by several positive factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, increase in net income and good cash flow from operations. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated."

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 9.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 19.8%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.

Investors have apparently begun to recognize positive factors similar to those we have mentioned in this report, including earnings growth. This has helped drive up the company's shares by a sharp 60.78% over the past year, a rise that has exceeded that of the S&P 500 Index. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, HLF should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.

HERBALIFE LTD has improved earnings per share by 15.0% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, HERBALIFE LTD increased its bottom line by earning $4.91 versus $3.95 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($6.00 versus $4.91).

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the Personal Products industry average, but is less than that of the S&P 500. The net income increased by 10.1% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $112.21 million to $123.54 million.

Net operating cash flow has increased to $195.89 million or 16.67% when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the industry average cash flow growth rate of -24.79%.

With no pretense, she told the liberal politician, "...It's great to see you in the United States Senate. But, you know, we all remember you from Saturday Night Live." [See video below. MP3 audio here.] "We grew up" watching you, the journalist added.

Franken was given five and a half minutes of air time to talk about his thoughts on a potential merger between cable giants Comcast and Time Warner. Yet, O'Donnell still found time for breezy questions such as asking, "Do you go back at all to watch SNL?... Don't we need more humor in the United States Congress?"

Earlier in the segment, guest co-host Anthony Mason brought up the subject of data collection and privacy. He questioned, "Should the government be looking at regulating what's happening with this information?"

Yet nowhere in the segment did Mason, O'Donnell or co-host Gayle King mention Barack Obama. Considering that Franken's party controls the Senate and the White House, it might make sense to question Democratic culpability related to NSA spying and other examples of data collection.

On the subject of the Comcast/Time Warner merger, O'Donnell offered very basic, generic questions: "Can you block this merger?"

A partial transcript of the March 10 CBS This Morning segment is below:

NORAH O'DONNELL: Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken is with us this morning. He sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and .later this month that group will hold hearings on the proposed merger by Comcast and Time Warner Cable. The $45 billion deal would give Comcast subscribers in 43 of the nation's top 50 markets. That's about 30 percent of paid TV customers. Senator Franken, good morning.

AL FRANKEN: Good morning.

O'DONNELL: Can you block this merger?

FRANKEN: Well, I can't block it. It would be up to the regulators. But I wrote them when I heard about this immediately and expressed my concerns, which is that this will be bad for consumers of TV, cable TV and the internet. Comcast is the number one provider of cable TV, the number one provider of the internet. Time Warner is the number two provider of cable TV and the number three provider of internet. And I think this will be -- I think consumers will end up paying more. There will be less competition. There will be less innovation and worse, even worse service.

...

MASON: You mentioned the internet. Both of these companies provide internet service. 60 Minutes did a report last night about how much inform something's being harvested from consumers all over America. Should the government be looking at regulating what's happening with this information?

FRANKEN: Yeah. Well, I've been looking at it. I'm chairman of the Privacy, Technology, and the Law Subcommittee and there's a lot of disturbing stuff up there. You saw it last night on 60 Minutes. I really believe that Americans have a right to privacy, that they have a right to know what's being taken, what of their private information something's being taken, and to give permission. If they're going to take their private information such as your location information, that says where you go to the doctor, where you drop your kids off at school, where you live, where you work, what you do. Last night's 60 Minutes story was a very good one. I urge you to -- that's on CBS, isn't it?

KING: Yes, Senator, it is.

FRANKEN: So, I have a piece of legislation I'll be reintroducing. It passed last Congress in the Senate committee.

O'DONNELL: And Senator, can I just say, you know, it's great to see you in the United States Senate. But, you know, we all remember you from Saturday Night Live. We all grew up --

FRANKEN: Thanks for remembering.

O'DONNELL: Do you still go back at all?

FRANKEN: Do I what?

O'DONNELL: Go back at all to watch SNL?

FRANKEN: I watch the show. I'm a big fan of the show. It's – you know – I think we're in our 39th year. The show's in its 39th year.

O'DONNELL: Don't we need more humor in the United States Congress?

FRANKEN: No.

KING: Well, some would say mission accomplished then.

FRANKEN: See? Very good. See who's funny here? [Pointing to Gayle.]##2195|Just days after it sought protection in Japan, once popular Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been forced to file for bankruptcy in the US in the hope of climbing out of the huge hole it's found itself in. Still reeling from the loss of 850,000 Bitcoins (currently worth around $549 million) and debts of more than $63.6 million, the company has filed papers that will temporarily suspend US legal action against it, allowing it to work out how "weaknesses in the system" allowed the digital currency to go missing in the first place. It's not quite the news customers were hoping for, but it's a logical move by Mt. Gox as it will better protect investors located outside of Japan and could also open avenues for it to take on financial aid. While it continues to piece together exactly what happened, some are taking matters into their own hands. Over the weekend, hackers reportedly gained access to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog as well as his Tumblr and Reddit accounts, accusing the company of fraud and alleging it kept some of the Bitcoins that had been reported stolen.##2196|It’s a benefit you’ve been purchasing your entire working life, but like legions of other Americans, you may not be aware of exactly what you’ve bought and, more importantly, the options and strategies you have for redeeming it. To be sure, there is a lot to know about Social Security — and, unfortunately, there is no user’s manual. But there is a statement.

It All Starts With the Statement

Your road to a better understanding of Social Security begins with one four-page report, your Social Security Statement.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) prepares and maintains statements for every person over the age of 25 who has paid into the system. You may or may not be aware of this, because the SSA has changed (more than once) its method of distributing the statement in recent years.

Starting in October of 1999, the statement was mailed to you every year. No need to request it; it just came. Today, after a series of changes, fits and starts in 2011 and 2012, the only way to access your statement is to visit www.ssa.gov and sign up for a “My Social Security” account.

Why should I go to the trouble, you ask? Well, the statement contains some pretty important stuff:

1. Your Earnings History. Found on page 3 of the statement, this is a record of every dollar you’ve paid into the Social Security system. You will want to check this for accuracy because it will determine the approximate amount of your monthly SS check once you start collecting benefits. Your earnings are listed year by year, and the SSA will use the best 35 of those to determine your benefit. If you find an error, contact SSA and get it fixed!

2. Your Estimated Benefits. Found on page 2 of the statement, this is an estimate of how much money you may get at age 62 (currently the earliest eligibility age), at full retirement age and at age 70. Importantly, this is only an estimate and is subject to change. It assumes you will work to your collection age and continue earning whatever you did last year. Generally speaking, the closer you are to retirement, the more accurate your estimate may be.

3. Program Summary. A letter summarizing the health of the program is included on page 1 of your statement. This year’s letter estimates that the system can meet all future liabilities through 2032. If nothing changes between now and then, benefits will need to be cut by 23% starting in 2033.##2197|Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.

They said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox’s claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.

Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.

Karpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.

Karpeles’ blog was titled “Magical Tux in Japan—Geekness brought me to Japan!” Karpeles, who is French, often used the nickname “MagicalTux” when posting on public message or chat forums. His blog went offline on Sunday shortly after it was attacked.

A screenshot of Karpeles' hacked blog. (Click to enlarge; strong language.)

Karpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.

The attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users’ personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.

The data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles’ CV and a Windows executable called “TibanneBackOffice,” among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.

The release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.

Mt. Gox’s demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin’s public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.

One of the files released by hackers claiming to have compromised Mt. Gox is a screenshot of what appears to be a SQL database tool.

Mt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.

The long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin’s core software who’ve said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.

Follow the money

Meanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.

The blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user’s public bitcoin “address” or “wallet,” which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.

Adam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox’s bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.

In a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.

At that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.

The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million.

Levine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.

“There’s a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it’s very, very difficult, and it’s tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it’s just obvious,” he said.

The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cybercrime thefts on record.

An academic paper published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.

“For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange,” they wrote.

Because bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.

“A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money,” said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization. “This is serious money for serious people.”

Another possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.

If that’s the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.##2198|The Chinese yuan moved in tight ranges against the U.S. dollar on Monday, after the People's Bank of China widened the currency trading band to allow greater volatility in the dollar-yuan exchange rate.

The Chinese central bank on Saturday widened the floating range of the yuan's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar to 2 percent, from 1 percent range it allowed previously.

The yen showed little reaction to the PBOC action, trading near last week's closing value of 6.1505.

The central bank on Monday set the central parity rate for the yuan to 6.1321 per dollar, compared to Friday's rate of 6.1346.

The move signals commitment from Chinese policy makers to grant the market forces a decisive role in the .

"With the market-oriented exchange rate formation mechanism for promoting reform, the future of the RMB will work with major international currencies, as there is sufficient flexibility in the way volatility will be the norm, the central bank said in a statement.

The yuan's trading band was last expanded in April 2012, to 1 percent from 5 percent.

Forex News##2199|30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates climbed by double digits on the latest Zillow Mortgage Marketplace ticker, owing to a number of variables including an upbeat employment report.

According to Zillow, 30-year fixed mortgages added ten basis points from the previous week, climbing from 4.11 percent to 4.21 percent. Interest rates had actually peaked at 4.27 percent as of Monday, March 10, before settling at 4.21 percent as of yesterday. Rates for 15-year fixed mortgages, on the other hand, closed at 3.15 percent, while 5/1 adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs, were at 2.74 percent yesterday. Compared to last year’s figures, mortgage rates remain significantly higher than they were, though not as high as their levels in the late summer months of 2013.

“Rates rose on Monday to levels not seen since mid-January, as the situation in Ukraine appeared to improve and Friday’s jobs report beat expectations,” said Zillow director of mortgages Erin Lantz, explaining the variables that caused this week’s upticks. She added that for the coming week, rates should be “fairly steady”, unless economic data released in the latter half of the week is “strong enough to accelerate the gradual upward momentum” that had followed after the release of Friday’s employment statistics.

Looking at activity in major markets, 30-year fixed mortgage rates had climbed by 15 basis points in California, rising from 4.11 percent to 4.26 percent, while rates accelerated by 13 hundredths of a percentage point in Colorado, zooming from 4.11 percent to 4.24 percent. Also, 30-year fixed mortgage rates climbed by 15 basis points in Massachusetts, moving from 4.07 percent to 4.22 percent.

Conversely, rates were up by only seven basis points (4.13 percent to 4.20 percent) in Florida and eight basis points (4.12 percent to 4.20 percent) in Pennsylvania.##2200|Even as federal officials catch heat for not disclosing how many Obamacare enrollees nationwide have actually paid their first insurance premiums, nine states and the District of Columbia have been releasing such data publicly.

Those states are seeing a wide range of outcomes in the rate of people who sign up for insurance plans on their government-run exchanges and make their first month's payments. That payment is required for people to actually be enrolled and eligible for health benefits under the plans.

Connecticut, whose Obamacare marketplace has been seen as a star of the state-run exchanges, leads the pack in paid enrollments. In the Nutmeg State, 92 percent of its 57,465 Obamacare sign-ups have coughed up the cash to make their enrollment official.

"It's never going to be 100 percent," said Kevin Counihan, CEO of Access Health CT, the state's marketplace. But, he added, "we're working very aggressively through health plans to get the other 8 percent in."

Minnesota is in second place, with 90 percent of enrollees paid.

California, whose 923,832 sign-ups make it the leader by far in nationwide Obamacare enrollment, is in third place, with 85 percent reported paid enrollment.

Maryland is dead last. The state's exchange, which has been a technological disaster, saw just 54 percent of enrollees paying for their first premiums as of March 1.



The exchanges operated by Washington state and Vermont also failed to crack 60 percent.

Five states that run their own Obamacare exchanges are not releasing the paid rate for the Obamacare exchanges they operate. And Massachusetts only reports paid enrollments; it does not report totals of people who have signed up for plans, meaning that the paid rate is unknown.

Five years ago Sunday, the stock market indexes toppled to their low points of recent times, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 6,547.10 on March 9, 2009 -- less than half of what it had been 17 months earlier. The S&P 500, meanwhile, dipped to 676.53, also far less than half of what it had been in October 2007, when it had soared to 1,565.15.

* Download the above chart in full-size

Today, the indexes are hitting new highs almost every week, as the Dow stands at more than 16,400 and the S&P is at more than 1,875.

Many of our local companies have enjoyed a similar ride with their stocks in the last five years, as share prices have soared and dividends have increased in many cases.

The chart below looks at the total five-year return of 62 area companies. Most are in Greater Cleveland. A few are outside the immediate region but are of keen interest to local investors, consumers and workers. The total return includes appreciation in the share price and income including dividends.

So if you invested $1,000 in a stock back in March 2009 and the return since then was 100 percent, you'd have $2,000. If the total return in the last five years was 2,738 percent, as is the case with Polyone Corp. of Avon Lake, your $1,000 investment would now be worth $28,380.

If you'd invested the same $1,000 with Cedar Fair, parent of Cedar Point, your investment would now be worth $11,240. In many cases, the returns wouldn't be quite so incredible: $1,000 then in J.M. Smucker or Progressive Corp. or A Schulman of Fairlawn would be worth about $3,000 today.

In some cases, the fabulous returns are a reflection of how low the stock has sunk during the financial meltdown of 2008 and early 2009. In other cases, the return reflects how well the company has done since then.

Likewise, at the bottom of the list: In a few cases, the companies haven't performed well in the last five years.

In other cases, like CBIZ Inc. of Independence, the company's stock price didn't fall much during the meltdown (only about 19 percent) and has gained since then (40 percent), but the growth has been more modest compared with other companies that plummeted and then rebounded.

In the case of FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, the electric utility has been undergoing a turnaround after posting big losses in 2012. Your $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth only $1,070 today.

The five-year returns are through Thurs., March 6; the share prices and year-to-date returns are as of Wed., March 5.##2209|Carl Icahn's assault on Ebay began with the idea that the company's payments business PayPal would be more valuable as a standalone company. It quickly devolved into a war of words with board member Marc Andreessen and Monday morning it took another turn as the billionaire investor put Ebay CEO John Donahoe squarely in his crosshairs.

Criticizing the same Skype transaction he has taken Andreessen to task over, Icahn says Donahoe's "inexcusable incompetence" cost EBay shareholders more than $4 billion.

(A quick refresher: EBay sold a stake in Skype to an investor group led by Silver Lake that also included Andreessen's venture capital firm. Less than two years later, following the resolution of some intellectual property concerns, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion.)

Icahn's latest barrage reiterates his charge that shareholders got fleeced in a deal that helped line the pockets of a board member for stepping in as middleman. From Monday's letter:

I believe that all stockholders must consider whether Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member. At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion. via Icahn Letter.

The letter, which came after Ebay rejected Icahn's proposed board slate Monday, also calls out Donahoe for trailing industry peers. From the start of January until January 10, 2014 -- when Icahn disclosed his investment -- Ebay shares have returned 2% to considerably better returns from Amazon.com (+60%), Visa (+48%) and MasterCard (+73%), the billionaire notes.

In a response, Ebay touted the 460% increase in its stock since Donahoe's first analyst day five years ago, beating the Nasdaq and overall stock market.

"John’s track record of success at eBay, driving the company’s turnaround and growth, is well documented," the statement continues. "Yet in pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John. Just like his previous ones, this attack is false and misleading and has already been utterly discredited by the facts."

Icahn, nodding to the original thrust of his case for buying into Ebay, touched on PayPal in Monday's letter, arguing that an independent payments company could be acquired at a rich premium instead of withering within its current corporate structure (a view that has been shared by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, he notes).

"I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell , Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo , Xerox , Sony , Palm, and AOL – the same way that Motorola Mobility may have gone had we not been able to convince Motorola’s board to bring in a new CEO and separate the companies – ultimately resulting in a sale to Google ," says Icahn.

PayPal is facing a battle against some of the biggest companies in the world, Icahn argues, among them Google, Apple and Visa, and the billionaire doesn't think Donahoe is the right guy to lead that charge.

"To win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty," he writes. "Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal. PayPal must be separated NOW so that great management can be attracted – management that can make the right decision and know when to sell at the right time, not the worst time."

In an acknowledgement that to date his case for a PayPal spinoff has largely been the rote argument made in most cases for corporate breakups, Icahn promised to share a case study on why such a move makes sense.

Two things remain clear: Icahn won't get his way without a fight and Ebay's management and board are going to give him one.

Shares of Ebay were down 1.6% to $58.08 Monday morning.

In the figures released by the State Department of Revenue on Monday, it was shown how much the state has accumulated from recreational and medical marijuana tax fees.

For the month of January, medical marijuana produced approximately $900,000 in additional sales and a total $2.5 million.

“The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations,” stated executive director of the department, Barbara Bohl.Â “We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts.”

Governor John Hickenlooper has announced that the state should expect approximately $1 billion in the next fiscal year, with an estimated $134 million expected in taxes and fees. With more than 150 recreational marijuana dispensaries now licensed, revenue is expected to remain steady. While the first $40 million of tax revenue is devoted to school construction, Hickenlooper has suggested the state also launch a heavy campaign addressing the concerns of substance abuse.##2211|* Simmering tensions over Ukraine hurt stocks, lift gold

* Friday’s strong U.S. jobs data keeps a lid on gains

* Largest gold ETF reports first inflow since Feb. 25 (Updates prices, adds comment)

By Jan Harvey

LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Gold recovered from early losses to edge higher on Monday as support from the standoff in Ukraine offset pressure from last week’s strong U.S. payrolls data and weakness in other commodities after a sharp drop in Chinese exports.

Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told President Vladimir Putin on Monday Russia’s position on Ukraine was at odds with the West, and that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had declined an invitation to visit Russia for further talks.

Russian news agency Interfax earlier quoted a Ukrainian base commander as saying Russian troops opened fire during the takeover of a Ukrainian military post in Crimea.

Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,342.60 an ounce at 1214 GMT, while U.S. gold futures for April delivery were up $4.70 an ounce to $1,342.90.

“Stock market weakness and gold strength this afternoon seem to stem back to the news from Crimea about shots being fired,” Saxo Bank’s head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen said. “It highlights the nervousness about what can happen.”

“Short-term traders in gold were playing it from the short side earlier today, so it’s back to square one for many.”

The precious metal fell as low as $1,328.86 in earlier trade, extending a 0.8 percent drop it made on Friday after U.S. payrolls data beat forecasts, suggesting the Federal Reserve’s stimulus tapering efforts will stay on course.

On the wider markets, European shares erased early gains to fall 0.7 percent after reports of renewed unrest in Ukraine.

Commodities in general sold off after a surprise fall in China’s exports, with copper sinking to 8-1/2-month lows, while oil lost more than a dollar and Shanghai-traded commodities slumped.

China, the world’s biggest consumer of many commodities including gold, said on Saturday its exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit.

TWO-WAY FLOWS

Chinese gold prices were trading at a discount of $5-$6 an ounce to spot prices on Monday, traders said, in a sign of weak demand. Prices were at a premium of more than $20 at the beginning of the year.

Two-way flows were evident in Asian gold trading overnight, MKS said in a report. “Once the Shanghai Gold Exchange opened some aggressive selling ensued, driving the price below $1,330,” it said. “Once again retail bids below this level emerged and supported the market.”

Investor sentiment towards gold has been positive this year after a 28 percent drop in prices in 2013.

Hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week as geopolitical tensions boosted speculative interest to the highest in more than a year, according to Friday data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust, said its holdings rose 1.5 tonnes on Friday, its first inflow since Feb. 25.

Among other precious metals, silver was flat at $20.88 an ounce.

The gold/silver ratio, which measures the number of silver ounces needed to buy an ounce of gold, hit a fresh five-week high at 64.4 as silver underperformed on Monday.

Spot platinum was down 0.2 percent at $1,475 an ounce, while spot palladium was down 0.9 percent at $772.40 an ounce. (Additional reporting by A.

Carney, testifying in front of a parliamentary committee just days after the central bank suspended one of its own staff members in connection with the foreign-exchange probe, said he would go “above and beyond” to reaffirm the bank’s standards.

“We can’t come out of this with a shadow of doubt about the integrity of the Bank of England,” he said. “The institution has to be beyond reproach.”

The bank hasn’t said precisely why the employee was suspended, but it has said its examination has so far found “no evidence” of staff members’ colluding in market manipulation.

During tense testimony, Carney said the BOE first became aware of allegations that it could be pulled into the probe on Oct. 16. The central bank immediately launched an internal investigation to ascertain the involvement of its staff, he said, but kept that secret for months. Carney said the bank’s publicly released minutes were redacted to exclude any mention of the matter.

The new deputy governor, who will focus on financial markets and banking, will have a role overseeing BOE employees’ relationships with market participants. “One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence and how we use it,” Carney said.

The $5.3 trillion-a-day currencies market is largely unregulated, but attention has turned toward the BOE’s role because of its close relationship with currencies traders and bankers dating back several years, particularly in the form of committee meetings for bankers and traders that it hosted. At issue is whether the central bank has, directly or otherwise, sanctioned or participated in any of the forms of behavior among traders that are now under scrutiny.

Move continues wave of Chinese companies looking to list overseas

Internet giant Alibaba Group's decision to seek a listing in the United States will help rekindle global investors' confidence in Chinese companies, experts said.

China's top e-commerce company confirmed on Sunday that it would start the long-anticipated initial public offering procedure.

The proposed IPO marks the latest wave of Chinese companies flocking to the US, drawn by surging valuations for tech startups and optimism toward Chinese stocks, said Hong Bo, founder of IT consultancy company IT5.

Li Zhi, principal analyst of Beijing-based Analysys International, said: "It is unlikely that Alibaba will experience short selling, since people are astounded by its meteoric growth and have confidence in the Chinese economy."

Fewer Chinese companies have listed in the US since 2011 amid accounting scandals and poor market sentiment. Eight Chinese companies listed in the US last year and only two in 2012, research company zero2ipo said in a report.

David Ethridge, senior vice-president and head of capital markets at NYSE Euronext Inc, said earlier this year that 15 to 20 Chinese companies, most of them tech companies, are expected to list at the exchange.

Alibaba said an IPO in the US would "make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals".

Should circumstances permit, Alibaba will extend its public status in the domestic capital market to share its growth with the people of China, the statement said.

The decision to seek an IPO in New York has put an end to rumors about its choice of venue, after the Internet behemoth wrapped up major buyouts to stay agile against cutthroat competition in the mobile Internet age.

The company had yet to decide a timetable, the underwriter, or the amount of money it hopes to raise through a listing, Alibaba spokesman Yang Lei said.

Alibaba failed to persuade Hong Kong regulators to accept its governance structure as it sought a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Alibaba's special request to keep a unique shareholder structure, allowing a group of top managers and founders to nominate and control the company's board, violated the exchange's principle of "one share, one vote".

Alibaba's founding members own about 13 percent of the company, while Japan's Softbank controls 37 percent and Yahoo, from the US, 24 percent.

The proposed US listing is the most anticipated IPO since social networking site Facebook raised $16 billion in 2012. Analysts polled by Reuters have put Alibaba's market value at around $140 billion and the value of the IPO at $15 billion.

The move came just two days after micro-blogging company Sina Weibo filed to raise $500 million via a US IPO. Alibaba holds 18 percent of Sina Weibo's shares.

Ablibaba's announcement of an IPO plan suggested it has fulfilled specific requirements of either the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, Li from Analysys International said.

"The dual-class stock structures, allowed by some US exchanges, can enable insiders to hold the controlling power even after a company becomes public. Companies of such structure issued shares to founders and prioritized investors that have multiple votes," she said.

But adjustments should still be made accordingly if Alibaba wishes to float its shares, Hong said.

"In a typical dual-class structure, the voting weight is subject to changes of its share-holding percentage. However in Alibaba's case, the 28-person partnership will have the absolute right to nominate a majority of the directors, even if their shares are diluted in the future," he said.

Hangzhou-based Alibaba has facilitated online transactions for multinational chain stores and mom-and-pop vendors. Gross merchandise traded on Alibaba reached $240 billion in 2013, while the figure for its equivalent Amazon was $100 billion, according to Forrester Research.

Its payment spinoff, Alipay, offers online saving funds with higher returns and online-to-offline payment solutions.

But such dominance is being eroded by rival Tencent, which rolled out mobile payment services via chat app WeChat and encroached on many services that overlap with Alibaba's portfolio. Analysts regarded the listing as timely since the current valuation may reach its peak level.

"The going-mobile war has just started and it's too early to tell who has a better chance to edge out, leaving investors the opportunity to put a bet on Alibaba," Li said.

But Li Yi, secretary-general of the China Mobile Internet Industry Association, said Alibaba's prospects are not so rosy, as it is short of effective mobile access points.

"It's easy to move from social networking to e-commerce. But the reverse goal, which Alibaba is struggling to do, is hard to achieve," he said.##2215|OK

Governor John Hickenlooper, who opposed the legalisation of recreational cannabis, would like to see the bulk of state revenue derived from both recreational and medical pot sales to go toward addiction treatment and programmes to prevent youths from using the drug.

He wants, for example, more advertising discouraging driving while high.

Under federal law, cannabis is still illegal, but the US government has indicated it will not act against states that have legalised it.

Washington state sales begin in coming months.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world's first fully regulated recreational marijuana market.

The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay's marijuana programme is still under development.##2219|Empty##2220|Your customers are here. You should be too.

* Gives response to allegations currency benchmarks rigged

* Bank to review how conducts market intelligence

* To announce details of new structure on March 18

* “We have to establish the integrity of markets” - Carney

By Jamie McGeever and David Milliken

LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - The Bank of England announced an overhaul of the way it works with banks and financial markets on Tuesday as it faced growing criticism of its response to possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates.

BoE Governor Mark Carney answered questions from lawmakers for four-and-a-half-hours, a large part of which was devoted to the Bank’s response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.

Carney said a new deputy governor position, responsible for banking and markets, will be created as part of the shake-up.

“One of the first tasks of that individual is that he or she will conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence,” Carney said.

Details of the new structure will be announced on March 18.

As lawmakers seized on the case to revive their demands tougher oversight of the BoE, Carney stressed the seriousness of the foreign exchange case and compared it to the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal. This resulted in criminal charges against traders, the resignation of Barclays’ chief executive and $6 billion in settlements paid by banks.

“This is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets, and we have to establish the integrity of markets,” Carney told legislators.

The BoE suspended an employee last week as part of its internal investigation into whether staff turned a blind eye to signs of manipulation in the $5.3 trillion-a-day global market, for which London is the main hub.

The BoE and other leading authorities including Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the U.S. Department of Justice opened investigations into the allegations last October.

More than 20 currency traders at several of the world’s biggest banks have been placed on leave, suspended or fired.

Minutes of BoE meetings with chief foreign exchange dealers released last week, in response to a Freedom of Information request by Reuters, showed concerns over possible manipulation were raised as early as 2006.

“RELENTLESS INVESTIGATION”

With lawmakers demanding details of how the Bank responded to the case, Carney said on Tuesday that the BoE’s top management moved quickly as soon as it learned of the allegations and it was relentless in its investigations.

He said he and other top officials first learned of the allegations on Oct. 16 last year and he told the Bank’s governing board, its Court of Directors, on the same day.

“We convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours, we retained external counsel and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation,” he said.

But the chairman of Tuesday’s hearings said the BoE had to do more to show that its “Byzantine” oversight structures were up to the job.

“This is the first real test for the Bank of England’s new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging,” lawmaker Andrew Tyrie said in a statement.

Since he took over the BoE in July last year, Carney has introduced several changes, including most notably the launch of its forward guidance policy that seeks to give a clear picture of when it might start to raise interest rates.

The case for structural change at the Bank has grown stronger since the foreign exchange allegations.

The BoE last year hired consultants McKinsey to advise on a strategic review to reflect the Bank’s expanded powers to oversee the banking sector.

The Bank currently has three deputy governors, one for monetary policy, another for financial stability and a third in charge of the BoE’s oversight of commercial banks.

Paul Fisher, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee who was previously BoE’s head of foreign exchange, said he too only found out about the allegations last October.

He said the alleged collusion being investigated now was different to discussions around possible manipulation of the “fixings” by non-market makers such as hedge funds as far back as 2006.

Fisher hit back at criticism from lawmakers that the BoE did not respond more vigorously and played down suggestions it should investigate potential trading abuse more broadly, something which falls to the FCA, Britain’s main market regulator.

“It’s not our job to go hunting for the rigging of markets,” he said when asked if the Bank had taken action in other markets in light of the concerns over possible FX manipulation.

FCA Chief Executive Martin Wheatley said the BoE was not being investigated as an institution but, in a letter to Tyrie made public on Tuesday, he said the FCA did have the authority to take action against BoE staff if needed.##2222|DUBLIN (AP) -- Yes, they have more bananas.

Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world's biggest banana supplier.

The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.

The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.

Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.

The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.

Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66).

Fyffes rose 46 percent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 percent to $12.20 in New York.

Fyffes, pronounced 'Fifes', is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.

David McCann, Fyffes' chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.

Lonergan said their "natural strategic partnership" would "provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice."

However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren't expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate.##2223|Why did this happen?

Business News##2227|Employees at Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX) stores just got good news. The company’s Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) App used to buy Starbucks products can now be used for tipping. Cash tips have been put into jars at the checkout until now.

According to Starbucks:

Beginning March 19, customers using Starbucks App for iPhone in the U.S., U.K. and Canada will experience a streamlined design and easy access to their account and My Starbucks Rewards information. In addition, customers using the app will have the option to leave a tip at more than 7,000 company-operated Starbucks® stores in the U.S. “With more than 11 percent of transactions a week now happening with a mobile device in our stores, and nearly 10 million customers currently using our mobile app, we’re thrilled to make the digital experience even easier and more rewarding for our customers and partners,” said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks. “This update to the Starbucks App for iPhone is an important next step in digital innovation at Starbucks and one of the many ways we’ll expand and improve our digital experience in the months to come.”

As is true at most large fast-food chains, store personnel are not very well paid. Starbucks has been listed as one of the 10 companies that pay their employees the least.

The new Starbucks App is yet one more proof that cash has become a less and less important part of the fast-food buying transaction. Fast-food companies have joined the migration to electronic payments and e-commerce. Whether this will help overall revenue for Starbucks will be a mystery for the time being. What will not is the ability of low-paid Starbucks employees to make a few extra dollars. That alone is a benefit most fast-food workers cannot enjoy now.##2228|Empty##2229|Empty##2230|Candy Crush Saga is seen on an iPhone screen. Photo: CFP

By David Milliken and Andy Bruce

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney signalled he was not concerned that Britain's economy was close to overheating, despite a strong recovery since last year, putting himself in the dovish camp among policymakers.

Speaking to lawmakers on Tuesday, Carney said the amount of spare capacity in the economy was probably slightly more than 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, suggesting the BoE can hold off on raising interest rates for longer.

Carney also said Britain's natural rate of unemployment could be less than the Bank has estimated, meaning the labour market can strengthen further without pushing up inflation.

Last month, the BoE put its assessments of spare capacity in the economy at the centre of its deliberations on when it will raise interest rates from a record low 0.5 percent, where they have stood since 2009 as Britain tries to recover from the financial crisis.

"We ranged in the February inflation report (that spare capacity) was 1-1.5 percent," Carney said in comments to the Treasury Select Committee in Britain's parliament.

"I personally would be at the upper end of that range and I would add that the margin, given the most recent employment report, that it would probably be slightly higher than that 1.5 percent."

Britain's unemployment rose to 7.2 percent in the three months to December, ending a string of falls that took the BoE by surprise.

Sterling weakened as Carney spoke. The pound has outpaced many other currencies in recent months on expectations that interest rates could rise in Britain before other economies.

In a sign of the different views among BoE policymakers on how long the economy can continue its recovery without fuelling inflation, Martin Weale - known as a hawk on the Monetary Policy

Committee - said he thought the amount of spare capacity was probably "something under 1 percent.

Financial markets have pointed to spring 2015 as a potential time for the first rate hike.

Output is still just below its peak in the first quarter of 2008 - a much weaker recovery from the financial crisis than in most other big advanced economies. The BoE is concerned that low productivity may limit Britain's ability to catch up without generating higher inflation in the medium term.

But Carney said productivity may be moving towards its long-term trend. "The most recent figures on productivity suggest around a 2 percent annualised growth rate, which is coming for the first time in a very long time towards trend."

When rate rises did come, they would be gradual, Carney said. Carney said he agreed with comments from Deputy Governor Charlie Bean on Monday that rates were unlikely to exceed 2.5 percent over the next three years.

NATURAL RATE

In February, the BoE said the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment - meaning the lowest jobless rate the economy can maintain - was probably around 6 to 6.5 percent.

Carney suggested it could be lower.

"What we've learnt over the course of the last seven months since we put in place the first phase of forward guidance, or so what I've learnt, is that that equilibrium rate of unemployment has gone down," he said.

"It's lower than we would have thought in August and in August we estimated as a committee that it was about 6.5 percent. I personally would mark it around 6 now, potentially slightly lower."

Carney also said he was concerned that an improvement in the housing market could lead to a worsening of mortgage underwriting standards.

"Underwriting standards at present of mortgage providers are quite high...," he said. "Our concern is that those underwriting standards will deteriorate and that that deterioration itself would be fed by general improvement in the housing market."

Gox, a leading bitcoin exchange that late last month filed for bankruptcy protection, updated its website on Tuesday to allow customers to log in and verify their wallet, or account, balance.

The website, which went blank just over three weeks ago, had previously posted occasional updates on Mt. Gox’s civil rehabilitation process – a legal procedure that may allow Mt. Gox to rebuild and pay back some of its creditors – as well as a warning that some spam or phishing emails purporting to be from the exchange were in circulation.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Feb. 28, saying it may have lost 850,000 bitcoins – worth around $520 million US at current prices – to hackers. It has since gone through a similar process in the United States.

A spokesperson reached via a helpline for Mt. Gox creditors confirmed that Mt. Gox set up the log-in, based on the last available data from the exchange’s servers before they shut down.

Leaked information from various hacking attacks on Mt. Gox servers and CEO Mark Karpeles’ personal blog and Reddit account have been released in recent weeks, and one file purporting to be the company’s internal database contained malware that could steal bitcoins once downloaded.

Besides the log-in option, the Mt. Gox homepage carried a statement in English and Japanese saying: "Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by Mt. Gox of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users."##2234|Empty##2235|× PRELIMINARY INFORMATION FORM

The major averages ended the day on opposite sides of the unchanged line. While the Dow edged down 11.17 points or 0.1 percent to 16,340.08, the Nasdaq rose 16.14 points or 0.4 percent to 4,323.33 and the S&P 500 crept up 0.57 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 1,868.20.

The initial weakness on Wall Street came on the heels of a sell-off in the overseas , with stocks in both Asia and Europe coming under pressure on the day.

Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, "With today's declines, most major European markets are at or below the closing lows of March 3rd, the Monday when markets finally reacted lower to Putin's war games."

"In Asia, the Shanghai, Hang Seng, Kospi, ASX, Singapore Straits and Japanese Topix are also at or near the March 3rd close but also are being influenced by China's growth concerns," he added.

While concerns about China and Ukraine also weighed on Wall Street at the open, traders seemed reluctant to make any significant moves amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front.

The subsequent recovery came as traders looked ahead to the release of closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices over the next two days.

Among individual stocks, shares of VeriFone (PAY) moved sharply higher after the maker of card-payment systems reported better than expected first quarter results and provided upbeat guidance.

Packaged food company Diamond Foods (DMND) also turned in a strong performance on the day after reporting better than expected second quarter results.

On the other hand, shares of Express (EXPR) saw significant weakness after the apparel retailer reported weaker than expected fourth quarter results and provided disappointing first quarter guidance.

Sector News

While many of the major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves, substantial strength was visible among gold stocks. The NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index surged up 2.8 percent to its best closing level in over four months.

The strength in the gold sector came amid a notable increase by the price of the precious metal, with gold for April delivery climbing $23.80 to $1,370.50 an ounce.

Networking and electronic storage stocks also moved to the upside on the day, contributing to the gain posted by the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

Considerable strength was also visible among utilities stocks, as reflected by the 1.2 percent gain posted by the Philadelphia Utility Sector Index. The gain by the index came after it ended the previous session at its lowest closing level in a month.

Other Markets

In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw significant weakness during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index plunged by 2.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.7 percent.

The major European markets also came under pressure on the day. While the German DAX Index fell by 1.3 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index both dropped by 1 percent.

In the bond market, treasuries moved notably higher, climbing further off their recent lows. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 4 basis points to 2.725 percent.

Looking Ahead

Following several quiet days, the economic calendar picks up on Thursday with the release of reports on weekly jobless claims, retail sales, and import and export prices.

The problem with Labor's argument to extend the banking royal commission is that Kenneth Hayne hasn't asked for more time - and the opposition's decision to hold its own hearings looks far too much like the stunt it is.##2240|Empty##2241|Empty##2242|SINGAPORE, March 10 (Reuters) - Copper sank to 8-1/2 month lows on Monday, dropping steeply for a second session, while oil lost more than a dollar and Shanghai-traded commodities slumped after a surprise fall in China's exports heightened fears of an economic slowdown.

China's exports fell 18.1 percent in February from a year ago, confounding market expectations for an increase and adding to a series of weak factory surveys from the start of 2014 that point to weakness in economic activity at the world's top consumer of most commodities.

Chinese commodities bore the brunt of the sell-off, with Shanghai copper sliding 5 percent, rubber down more than 4 percent and Dalian iron ore futures slumping nearly 6 percent. China’s equities sank to a five-year low.

“The China data shows there will be more difficult times ahead,” an iron ore trader in Shanghai said.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange hit a session low of $6,608 a tonne, its cheapest since June 25.

The metal was down 1.4 percent at $6,690 by 0842 GMT, adding to a 3.8 percent loss on Friday which was its steepest decline since April 2012.

Copper in Shanghai fell by its daily downside limit of 5 percent to close at 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne.

Despite a drop in overall exports, China’s imports of most commodities from copper to crude oil and iron ore rose in February from a year ago. The weak exports suggest China’s commodity import demand could weaken in the coming months as end-users draw down swollen inventories.

But China’s imports of oil, copper and iron ore all fell from levels in January.

“Fundamental demand has not resumed to normal levels yet,” said analyst Chunlan Li of minerals consultancy CRU in Beijing.

Brent crude declined $1.13 to $107.87 a barrel, snapping a two-day rise fuelled by tensions between Russia and Ukraine that could potentially disrupt oil supplies.

U.S. oil fell $1.25 to $101.33, after touching a high of $102.82.

Russian forces tightened their grip on Moscow-backed Crimea by seizing another border and a military airfield as German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Russian President Vladimir Putin that a planned referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution.

Shanghai steel futures dropped 4 percent to a contract low of 3,221 yuan a tonne, and Dalian’s iron ore slid 5.9 percent to 728 yuan a tonne, its weakest since the bourse introduced iron ore futures on Oct. 18.

Steel demand in China, the world’s biggest consumer and producer, has been weak since the start of the year as a slowing economy curbs demand for the building material.

Construction activity, which typically picks up from March, is unlikely to spur a strong recovery in demand for steel as Beijing pursues economic expansion that is less driven by investment and more fuelled by domestic consumption.

Spot gold fell for a second session and hit a one-week low of $1,328.86 an ounce, largely due to the strong U.S. employment data released on Friday that suggested the Federal Reserve’s stimulus tapering efforts will stay on course.

But some traders say the disappointing Chinese trade data also weighed as investors in Shanghai futures and spot contracts sold bullion. China is the world’s top gold consumer.

“We can see liquidation from the Shanghai futures exchange and there is no fresh buying interest on the physical side,” said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Hong Kong’s Wing Fung Precious Metals.

LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - The Royal Bank of Scotland and other Scottish-based financial firms might have to move their headquarters to England if Scotland becomes independent and joins the European Union, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday.

Carney said if Scotland chose to break away from the rest of the United Kingdom at a Sept. 18 referendum, EU law stipulated it would need to guarantee deposits in England and Scotland where many have their largest customer bases.

Scotland is home to the second-largest financial services industry in the United Kingdom, accounting for about 150,000 jobs and making up about 12.5 percent of Scottish GDP.

“It is not clear in the European context that the domicile of the major banks up in Scotland would remain in Scotland given the location of head office like activities in the rest of the UK,” Carney told British lawmakers in a parliamentary committee.

He said RBS, once the world’s largest bank which is 81 percent owned by the British government state owned after being bailed out in 2008, may have to move.

“It’s a distinct possibility but I shouldn’t prejudge it. It depends on their arrangements as well,” he said.

Uncertainty over how independence will impact companies has become a major talking point of the independence debate.

Insurance firm Standard Life and investment manager Alliance Trust have already started setting up some companies based in England in a precautionary move because of uncertainty over tax, regulation, currency and EU membership should Scotland end its 307-year tie with England.

A row over what currency would be used in an independent Scotland has exacerbated worries among businesses. The main UK political parties have rejected Scottish leader Alex Salmond’s plan to share the pound in a currency union with Scotland and keep the Bank of England as the lender of last resort.

Carney said any “informal adoption of sterling” by an independent Scotland without a currency union would mean it lost the lender of last resort facilities of the Bank of England.

He said the central bank was well appraised of the potential risks.

Carney also stressed he would not drawn on his own views on what is the best way forward for Scotland.

“There is a wide range of factors which would determine viability and viability in a currency union. (It’s) like being pregnant - you can’t be half viable in a currency union,” he said.

Asked again about his views on the rules needed for a currency union, he said: “I have views but not that I am willing to share, not that I would prefer to share.”##2245|Empty##2246|Empty##2247|With an increase in food prices offsetting a drop in energy prices, the Labor Department released a report on Tuesday showing a modest increase in U.S. consumer prices in the month of February.

The Labor Department said its consumer price index edged up by 0.1 percent in February, matching the increase seen in January. The uptick in prices also matched economist estimates.

More than half of the increase by the consumer price index was due to higher food prices, which rose by 0.4 percent in February after inching up by 0.1 percent in January.

The increase in food prices was driven by a 0.5 percent increase in the index for food at home, with four of the six major grocery store food group indexes increasing.

Meanwhile, the report showed that energy prices dropped by 0.5 percent in February after climbing by 0.6 percent in the previous month.

The Labor Department said a 1.7 percent decrease in gasoline prices more than offset sharp increases in fuel oil and natural gas prices.

Excluding food and energy prices, the core consumer price index ticked up by 0.1 percent for the third consecutive month. The increase by core index also came in line with economist estimates.

A 0.2 percent increase by the shelter index contributed to the increase by the core index along with higher prices for medical care, airline fares, personal care, recreation, and new vehicles.

On the other hand, the report showed decreases in prices for household furnishings and operations, apparel, used cars and trucks, and tobacco.

Compared to the same month a year ago, the consumer price index was up by 1.1 percent in February, reflecting a notable slowdown from the 1.6 percent growth seen in January.

The Labor Department said the core consumer price index was up by 1.6 percent year-over-year, unchanged from the previous month.

Peter Boockvar, managing director at the Lindsey Group, said, "Bottom line, the inflation stats remain benign, which allows the Fed to continue to keep rates at essentially zero and gives them time to methodically continue the taper."

"That said, I believe the inflation figures have bottomed, because we are about to add higher commodity prices (ex industrial metals) to 2%+ services inflation," he added.

Last Friday, the Labor Department released a separate report showing that its producer price index for final demand edged down by 0.1 percent in February after rising by 0.2 percent in January.

The modest decrease by the index came as a surprise to economists, who had expected prices to creep up by another 0.2 percent.

With the unexpected monthly decrease, the annual rate of producer price growth slowed to 0.9 percent in February from 1.2 percent in January.

Forex News##2248|The allegations, which Herbalife strenuously deny, are that the U.S. firm is making money from new distributors, rather than from sales. The allegations stem from billionaire investor William Ackman, who has long demanded regulators probe deeper into Herbalife's distribution ethic, which he calls a "pyramid scheme," where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.Herbalife denied the allegations and said it would cooperate fully with the FTC enquiry. However, on the news of the probe the share price dropped by 15 percent but did recover to an 8.5 percent drop by late afternoon.A company statement reported in the Los Angeles Times stated that the nutrition giant "welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”##2249|##2250|Inflation slowed to just 1.1 percent annually in February, according to the Consumer Price Index published Tuesday morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Core inflation, which factors out increases in food and energy prices and is generally less volatile, was higher, at 1.6 percent.

Headline inflation, at 1.1 percent, was slower than December's 1.5 percent and January's 1.6 percent.

Food prices rose 0.4 percent in February, accounting for more than half of the overall price level rise in February, according to the BLS.

At just above 1 percent, inflation, as measured by the CPI, is roughly half of the 2-percent goal that the Federal Reserve has adopted.

Although some investors and Fed analysts have suggested that recent months' data show labor markets tightening, inflation remains below where Fed officials expect it would be in the case of a strengthening economy.

Fed officials, meeting Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington to discuss the central bank's monetary policy, have said it "likely will be appropriate" to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate, which is currently 6.7 percent, falls well below 6.5 percent, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent target.

Other measures of inflation the Fed monitors tell a similar story — that prices are rising only slowly.

For instance, the personal consumption expenditures chain price index, taken from a different survey than the CPI, also showed core inflation low in January, at just 1.1 percent. The Fed views core PCE inflation as more informative about the underlying trend of inflation than other gauges.

With inflation slowing, rather than picking up, the Fed is less likely to take steps to retreat from its efforts to ease the money supply and signal earlier interest rate hikes.##2251|Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman gave another presentation on Herbalife—a multi-level marketing company that he's betting $1 billion will go under.

Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, declared over a year ago that he's shorting Herbalife because he believes the company operates as a "pyramid scheme."

Herbalife has publicly denied Ackman's allegations.

So far, the short hasn't played out in his favor either. He's lost an estimated $500 million in mark-to-market losses.

His latest presentation focuses on Herbalife's business practices in China. In short, Ackman believes that the nutrition company is violating Chinese direct-selling laws.

Specifically, Pershing Square alleges that Herbalife violates Chinese laws by doing the following:

"Paying multi-level, royalties based upon unlimited downline levels"

"Paying royalties and commissions totaling more than 30% of sales volume."

"Incentivizing Distributors to recruit a potentially infinite downline in order for Distributors to reap sales-based 'Consulting Fees'"

"Permitting and incentivizing individual Distributors to recruit other participants."

We've included his slidedeck. This time it was only 56 slides compared with his famous 342-slide presentation when he first unveiled his short thesis.##2252|Last Updated: 18 Mar 2014

The Bank of England has announced three new appointments: among the new names is Dr Nemat Shafik ('Minouche' to her friends), who as the Bank’s new deputy governor for markets and banking, will become only the fifth woman to sit on the Monetary Policy Committee since it was formed in 1997 – and the first in four years.



The other two appointments (male, natch) are former Goldman Sachs economist and Treasury adviser Ben Broadbent, who will replace current deputy governor for monetary policy when Charlie Bean steps down at the end of June after 14 years at the Bank. Whitbread chairman Anthony Habgood will oversee the court of the Bank of England.



George Osborne, who is in charge of appointments to the Bank of England, has been criticised for picking people he ’plays golf with’ to join the Bank. No word on whether Shafik, who is currently deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, ever frequents the fairway – but it’s an encouraging step forward for the all-white, all-male MPC.

This isn't the last we'll hear of the new, improved Bank of England: on Wednesday evening governor Mark Carney will announce a 'radical shake-up' of the way it functions. He's already said he wants to break down the 'silos' and create 'one bank'.

Shafik said this morning she's excited about the chance to 'reshape the Bank's balance sheet, review and strengthen the Bank's operational roles, and, through continued international engagement, reform financial markets for the post-crisis world'.

She follows in some illustrioius female footsteps: the former ladies of the MPC have included an CBI economic adviser and a Shell chief economist...

1. Kate Barker CBE (2001-2010)

Previously: Chief economic adviser at the CBI. During her time on the MPC she led two major policy reviews for government, one on housing supply and one on land use planning.

Now: Senior adviser to Credit Suisse, non-executive member of the Office for Budget Responsibility’s oversight board, non-exec director of Electra Private Equity, Taylor Wimpey and Yorkshire Building Society.

2. Marian Bell CBE (2002-2005)

Previously: Set up and ran research function of RBS’s treasury and capital markets division, worked at the Treasury

Now: Member of the Fiscal Policy Panel of the States of Jersey, economics consultant, member of Zurich Insurance’s International Advisory Council.

3. DeAnne Julius (1997-2001)

Previously: Chief economist at British Airways and Shell, senior economic advisor at the World Bank, consultant to the IMF.

Now: Director at Jones Lang LaSalle, non-exec director at Deloitte.

4. Rachel Lomax (2003-2008)

Previously: Permanent secretary of three departments (the Department of Work and Pensions, the Welsh Office and the Department for Transport), vice president and chief of staff at the World Bank, head of economic and domestic secretariat at the Cabinet Office

Now: Non-exec director at HSBC##2253|For the last several weeks, a firestorm has been raging between eBay and activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been blasting the company's CEO and its board members, particularly the famed Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen.

In his letters, Icahn has also been making two demands: That PayPal spin-off from eBay and that two of his employees join the company's board.

Not only has CEO John Donahoe staunchly insisted that the two company's will not split, but today eBay rejected both of Icahn's board member nominees in its preliminary proxy statement for its annual meeting.

eBay's Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recommended Scott Cook to serve as a board member again. In his letters , Icahn had insisted multiple times that Cook, co-founder of Intuit, shouldn't be on the board, because Intuit is a long-term competitor of PayPal.

eBay's other board nominees are Elevation co-founder Fred Anderson, former CEO of Agilent Technologies Edward Barnholt, and John Donahoe, eBay's president and CEO.

In his latest letter to the eBay's board this morning, Icahn writes that Donahoe has cost shareholders $4 billion because of his incompetence.

eBay responded by accusing Icahn of a "false and misleading" attack:

John Donahoe has delivered astounding results for eBay shareholders since he became CEO in 2008. In the five years since John's first analyst day, eBay's stock price has increased more than 460%, significantly outpacing both the Nasdaq and the overall market. John's track record of success at eBay, driving the company's turnaround and growth, is well documented. Yet in pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John. Just like his previous ones, this attack is false and misleading and has already been utterly discredited by the facts.

Disclosure: Marc Andreessen is an investor in Business Insider.##2254|You are using an older browser version.

We see little churn risk from price hike Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) formally announced a $20 increase for the Prime membership program to $99, beginning with annual customer renewals. For context, Amazon has held the Prime price steady for nine years, even as fuel and transportation costs have risen, and as the company added significant inventory of physical and digital products eligible for Prime. We expect minimal churn, and overall view the increase as slightly position in terms of offsetting higher shipping expenses.

Price increase was expected, but rollout staggered

According to an e-mail we received from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the 2014 annual Prime renewals will continue at the original price of $79, while 2015 renewals will reflect the higher $99 price. We note that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had previously disclosed the company was considering a price increase of up to $40 for Prime; however, the new $99 fee strikes us a reasonable balance between offsetting higher expenses and maintaining a compelling offering for consumers.

We expect minimal churn

Based on our surveys of consumers, key reasons to shop on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) (and online more generally) include convenience, selection, and price comparisons. In our view, Amazon Prime helps to amplify the first two drivers, and as such, we see little likelihood of meaningful churn from the price increase. Moreover, we note there are precedents for increasing memberships with little impact on subscribers, such as at club stores. Also important is that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) only earned $3.1 billion in shipping revenues in 2013 on shipping costs of $6.6 billion.

Amazon confirms Prime eligible items surpass 20 million units

Just in the past year, our tracking of Prime eligible items has increased from 19 million items

in Q1-2013 to 23 million items in Q1-2014. Please see our quarterly Amazon Inventory Surveys for more details.

International Prime still at early stages

We estimate at least 60% of global Prime members are U.S. residents, as International roll-out remains in early stages. For context, Amazon launched Prime program in UK, Japan, and Germany in 2007, and in Canada in 2013. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has yet to launch Prime in China, Italy, or Spain.

The US Department of Defense issued a statement saying no one was hurt in the operation, which was requested by the Libyan government and sanctioned in international waters southeast of Cyprus.

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said the Seals successfully took control of the rogue vessel, and that their actions had been approved by President Barack Obama.

The arrival of the Morning Glory vessel at the As-Sidra port sparked a chain of events which led to Libyan prime minister Ali Zeidan being voted out of office by his own parliament.

The tanker was able to break a Libyan government naval blockade on the port, illegally pick up a reported 234,000 barrels of state-owned crude oil that had been seized by rebels.

The Libyan navy tried to seize the vessel and escort it to a government-held port on 10 March, but despite being fired upon it was able to escape.

Military personnel blamed the rough weather for its failure, an ultimately crippling embarrassment for Zeidan's government after a minister had pledged the tanker would be "turned into a pile of metal" if it left port.

Mr Kirby's statement said: "The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra."

The Cypriot ministry of foreign affairs told Reuters the vessel was now heading west in the Mediterranean with a US military escort. It had been anchored 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Cyprus when the Navy Seals operation was carried out at around midnight Cyprus time.##2258|Empty##2259|Latest Stories

Bloomberg reports, citing two US officials, that investigators are growing more convinced that the jetliner's most likely last-known position was around 1,000 nautical miles west of Perth in the India Ocean.

However, experts said there's a good chance MH370 will never be found if it's gone into a deep and remote part of the Indian Ocean.

Australia today took charge of the search in the Indian Ocean.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Parliament Australia would co-ordinate operations in the vast search area to its west.

Mr Abbott spoke to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak today. "I offered the Malaysian Prime Minister additional maritime surveillance resources which he gratefully accepted."

Defence Force chief General David Hurley had been in touch with his Malaysian counterpart to discuss how additional resources could be used.

Australia has two P-3 Orion surveillance planes on the search and are reported to be looking around the The Cocos islands about 2,000 nautical miles northwest of Perth.

Mr Abbott said: "We will do our duty to ensure that our search and rescue responsibilities are maintained and upheld and we will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery."##2261|Feature, Movies & Books

Earlier coverage of Herbalife and of Mr. Ackman from this site is here, here, and here.

Not among the three bylines on the Times article is Alison Leigh Cowan, who was described in the book Confidence Game as Mr. Ackman's pipeline into the Times. The Times article reports:

In a book about his MBIA wager called "Confidence Game," the reporter-turned-financial analyst Christine S. Richard chronicled how he fought with regulators for seven years before his prediction that MBIA stock would "spiral downward" came true. In a twist, it was Ms. Richard, who left Bloomberg News to start up the Wall Street research shop Indago Group, who gave Mr. Ackman the idea to short Herbalife.

The press can be almost as powerful as, or even more powerful than, the regulators in these high-stakes battles involving shortsellers and battleground stocks.

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company’s app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars among workers. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing that baristas don’t earn that much. Others say that they already fork over enough money and shouldn’t be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

Zee Lemke, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said most customers nevertheless leave a tip of some sort. She said tips generally add between $1.50 and $2 to her hourly pay of $9.05. But she noted that there’s no rule on how much baristas can expect to earn from tips.

“It varies a lot from store to store, even in the same city,” Lemke said. At the drive-thru location where she works, for instance, she said tips go down when it’s cold out and people are less likely to reach out and put money in the tip box that hangs off a ledge.

Lemke, 30, said mobile tipping has the potential to boost the amount she earns. Still, she doesn’t like the idea of employers relying on tips to compensate workers.

“It’s a way of claiming workers make more than you’re paying them,” she said.

Starbucks, meanwhile, has been pushing to get people to sign up for its mobile app and rewards program, which helps boost the number of times people are likely to visit its stores. The Seattle-based company says the addition of the mobile tipping option is a response to demand from customers, many of who no longer carry around much cash.

“We asked our customers what they thought would be easiest and best,” Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks, said in a phone interview. There are no plans to bring the mobile tipping option to stores licensed to other operators, however.

Exactly how Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss Riordan, an attorney who represented baristas in lawsuits saying shift supervisors shouldn’t share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.

“They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees … based on the number of hours worked,” she said.

As for the tips earned through mobile payments, Starbucks said they’ll be paid out to workers in cash in line with however they receive their regular tips.##2266|Empty##2267|Deep distrust between Asian neighbours and sensitive security issues are jamming essential communication lines in the chaotic hunt for a Malaysia Airlines plane, analysts said Thursday.

Bickering between Malaysia, China and others involved in trying to solve the baffling weekend disappearance of the jet has exposed longstanding tensions and prevented a coordinated response, they said.

"There clearly are communication problems on multiple levels. There is an underlying lack of trust in these matters," Bridget Welsh, an associate professor of political science at Singapore Management University, said.

"The issues of protecting territory, security intelligence and interests are starting to win over the common goal of finding the plane and closure."

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went inexplicably missing on Saturday en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.

Since then, there have been frustrating delays and much confusion in the release of scarce but essential information, such as radar data and satellite imagery.

Authorities appear to have no idea what happened to the plane, with the search covering both sides of peninsular Malaysia, an area of nearly 27,000 nautical miles (more than 90,000 square kilometres).

Levels of confusion appeared to hit startling new highs on Thursday when Malaysia claimed that Chinese satellite photos, which had appeared to indicate possible debris in the South China Sea, were released in error and showed no such thing.

China, which is deeply involved because there were 153 Chinese citizens on board, on Wednesday accused the Malaysian authorities of releasing information in a "chaotic" fashion.

It then appeared to surprise the Malaysians by releasing the satellite data. Malaysia and Vietnam deployed planes to the area highlighted by the Chinese but found nothing.

At his daily briefing Thursday, Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters that China had told them the satellite photos were released "by mistake and did not show any debris".

Highlighting the lack of cooperation, Vietnam Civil Aviation Authority deputy director Dinh Viet Thang earlier said Vietnamese officials had only learnt of the Chinese satellite sighting on the Internet, not from official channels.

Communist-run China, though, insisted on Thursday that Malaysia was to blame for the bulk of the confusion, while warning the search would continue to suffer unless there was greater transparency.

"As Malaysia Airlines is state owned, the Malaysian government is the core force in the fact-finding mission," the state-run Xinhua news agency said.

"Unless transparency is ensured, the huge international search operation can never be as fruitful as we hope and expect."

But Malaysia's Hussein denied that there were problems between countries involved in the search operation.

"On the search operations, it is not just Malaysian assets. We are talking about sophisticated equipment deployed by the US and China," he said.

"To say it is just on our shoulders, I think that is unfair. Because the overwhelming support and effort on a multinational level, is something we should be proud of."

Singapore-based Aviation expert Terence Fan said military radar from various countries may have detected the plane but governments were reluctant to share the data because it would reveal their capabilities and compromise security.

"There may be some military sensitivity because the radar is not continuous, it sort of sweeps around a couple of times," Fan said.

"The rate at which they can take the picture can also reveal how good the radar system is and that I think is probably why the countries around here are not very fond of sharing the information."

But again Hussein defended his country, saying Malaysia was releasing sensitive radar data that would normally be kept confidential.

"Malaysia has nothing to hide," he said.

Adding another layer to the tensions, much of the search has been focused on the South China Sea, which for decades has been one of Asia's most volatile security flashpoints due to competing territorial claims.

China insists it has sovereign rights to nearly all of the sea, which has some of the most important shipping lanes in the world and is believed to hold enormous amounts of natural resources.

Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan also have claims to parts of the sea.

Perceived increased aggressiveness from China in staking its claims in recent years has rattled its neighbours, particularly the Philippines.

Manila says that on Sunday Chinese ships blocked two Philippine vessels from carrying supplies to soldiers at a shoal. The Philippines evaded the blockade by dropping food from a plane, it's military said.

Graham Webster, a Beijing-based fellow at the Yale Law School China Centre specialising in US-China relations, said the search could have been an opportunity to build trust between the armed forces and civilian authorities of Asian neighbours.

"But there still may be real trust problems when it comes to sharing intelligence," he said.##2268|The disappearance of Malaysian Air Flight 370 has the entire world wondering what happened. How can 239 people and a Boeing 777 disappear into thin air? Most experts believe that the plane somehow suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure, but now the world is speculating possible human involvement. Here are some of the top conspiracy theories and rebuttals currently circulating in social media discussion:

The plane was shot down by the US Navy shortly after it took off.

Impossible since the engines of the plane submit real-time data through a satellite uplink. For this flight, that data was being submitted a full five hours after the takeoff of the jet.

The two Iranians or the flight crew turned off the plane’s transponder and flew it to an undisclosed location.

False. The plane would have to fly through the active radar of many countries and it never showed up again on any radar.

The plane flew east and landed at a secret base, perhaps in Vietnam or the Philippines.

False. The Malaysian government tracked the plane going west. In addition, a large airstrip is required to land a 777 and such a strip would easily be seen on satellite pictures.

The plane was struck by a missile and pilots were able to send a distress call before it crashed.

False. This particular airplane is a fly-by-wire which means the pilots have direct control. The plane turned around and flew in an opposite direction than what was programmed into its flight computer. If a missile hit the cockpit of the plane, it could not turn nor could any autopilot be activated. If the pilots were all dead, the plane is programmed to continue flying and land by itself.

Aliens took the plane.

We have no answer for this one, but it is a popular source of discussion.

The plane survived and has landed somewhere and the U.S. government knows exactly where it is.

This would cause a scandal that would bring down the Obama administration and cause untold damage to the United States. Would President Obama authorize something like this which could lead to war?

Mistrust of the government, belief in aliens, or the Illuminati causing the disappearance are all theories constructed in the world of social media. The Malaysian government has officially stated that someone aboard the plane disabled critical systems. The question remains? Was it the flight crew or unknown passengers that committed this crime? In the end, the truth will come out.##2269|EDMONTON, AB, Mar 10, 2014/ Troy Media/ – The “Ukrainian Crisis” could be a game changer for the Canadian and global energy industry.

While the direct impact on Canada from the crisis is negligible, the fallout could be immense. The crisis has affected Ukraine’s nascent natural gas industry as well as the pipelines used to transport Russian gas, but more importantly it has shown the importance of a safe, secure, politically-neutral source of energy for Europe and questions the EU’s reliance on Russian gas.

The latest “Ukrainian Crisis” began with protests over EU integration and was fuelled by the Yanukovych government’s corruption, kleptocracy, and determination to quash any dissension. The protests have been bloodier and have lasted longer than any since the Orange Revolution and reignited long-smouldering geographic and ethnic divides. Yanukovych and his inner cabal have fled the country with billions of dollars, which has left Ukraine on the verge of bankruptcy. Ukraine now flounders precariously as a pawn in a game of realpolitik between Russia and the West which no one other than the Kremlin was prepared for.

International companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron, both of which are willing to accept the risks associated with a poor business environment, have maintained their shale gas exploration programs in Ukraine, while ExxonMobil plans on reopening negotiations to explore the Black Sea once a new government has been elected. But in terms of the global gas industry, these are minor plays and do not impact anyone outside of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s importance in the world energy market is at a transit point for Russian gas. The Russian pipelines which run through Ukraine supply 14 per cent of Europe’s total gas imports, and Russia’s threat to reduce the gas to Ukraine would affect all of Europe. However, the affect will be less than in previous disputes due to Gazprom’s new Nord Stream pipeline, new storage facilities in Europe, and high levels of gas in storage.

If this crisis had happened during a cold January, the contagion within Europe could have been a disaster for EU consumers and businesses. Russia knows this and is using petro-politics to influence decisions in Brussels and throughout the EU.

With more than 25 per cent of gas consumed in Europe coming from Russia, and countries such as Germany importing the majority of its gas from Russia, Europe has little choice but to placate Russia, at least in the short term. This is a wake-up call for the EU: unless it is willing to have Russia as the hegemonic power in Europe, it must diversify its energy supplies to include new supplies from Australia, the U.S., and Canada. This will change the entire world gas industry.

Prior to the “crisis”, the U.S. was planning to export large amounts of gas to Asia, but delays in the widening of the Panama Canal have meant that the large LNG super tankers, designed to ship LNG to Asia, will not be able to travel through the canal until at least 2016. This means that there is extra shipping capacity from North America to anywhere – including Europe – that can handle the large LNG super tankers. It makes political, economic and logistical sense to move gas from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Europe. The “Ukraine Crisis”, as bloody as it is, provides opportunities for the Canadian industry, which, until now, has lagged behind the U.S. in development due to a lack of export infrastructure.

Lessening the supply of U.S. LNG exports to Asia gives Canadian exporters a competitive and comparative advantage over other suppliers. The price difference, or arbitrage, between North American and Asian prices is as high as $12, meaning the price could be adjusted, benefitting both buyers and sellers, while still being competitive. Tankers from Canada’s West Coast can reach Asian customers in 11 to 15 days, much shorter than vessels from the Middle East. Most important, however, Canadian supply is not subject to the same level of political and security uncertainty that affect Russian and Middle East suppliers and the “Ukrainian Crisis” has shown security does matter.

The future of Ukraine energy is as uncertain as ever. The realpolitik moves by Russia have changed the game and sparked a conversation on the future of not only Ukraine but European energy integration in its entirety. This is a conversation that is good for Canada’s LNG export industry and shows the importance of a secure and safe supply of LNG. One that Canada can supply.

Troy Media Marketplace © 2014 – All Rights Reserved##2270|China on Saturday announced a modest easing of exchange rate controls that have been criticized by Washington and other trading partners, adding to a flurry of reform initiatives aimed at making its slowing economy more efficient.

The range in which the tightly controlled yuan is allowed to fluctuate against the dollar each day will double in size, though to a still relatively narrow 2 percent.

The move was widely expected after Premier Li Keqiang promised in an annual policy speech last week to give market forces a “decisive role” in allocating credit and other resources in the state-dominated economy.

The ruling Communist Party says it wants to inject more competition into the economy and nurture self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

In a steady drumbeat of recent changes, authorities also have announced plans to create China’s first privately financed banks and promised to ease the tax and regulatory burden on entrepreneurs.

Widening the trading band will help to “optimize the efficiency of capital allocation and market allocation of resources to accelerate economic development,” the central bank said in a statement.

The U.S. Treasury Department had no immediate reaction to the announcement.

China’s rapid economic growth tumbled to a two-decade low of 7.7 percent last year. This year’s official growth target is slightly lower at 7.5 percent, but Li said last week Beijing will be flexible about it as long as the economy generates enough new jobs.

Washington and other governments complain Beijing suppresses the value of the yuan, unfairly making Chinese exports cheaper abroad and hurting foreign competitors.

The relatively small size of Saturday’s change appeared unlikely to mollify Beijing’s foreign critics. Some U.S. lawmakers have demanded punitive tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing failed to ease controls, but the White House has resisted imposing sanctions.

Beijing reported a $260 billion global trade surplus last year, a $30 billion increase over 2012 and among the largest ever recorded by any country.

Chinese leaders say they plan eventually to let the yuan float freely, but private sector analysts say that might be decades away.

Beijing is reluctant to allow big changes in the currency for fear of hurting exporters that employ millions of workers. But analysts say they might have gained confidence from recent strong trade performance.

Allowing the yuan to rise in value will increase the buying power of Chinese households, helping to achieve the ruling party’s goal of nurturing more sustainable economic growth based on domestic consumption instead of trade and investment.

A stronger yuan also could help suppress pressure for politically sensitive consumer prices to rise by making imports cheaper.

Reform advocates say that by suppressing the yuan’s value, Beijing has been forcing even poor households to subsidize exporters.

In recent weeks, the central bank has been guiding the yuan’s exchange lower against the dollar in what analysts said was an effort to discourage speculators who are moving money into China to profit from the currency’s rise.

Beijing allowed the yuan to gain about 20 percent against the dollar beginning in 2005 but movement stopped after the 2008 global crisis as the government tried to protect struggling exporters.

The yuan has been trading at about six to $1. Analysts say Beijing might allow that to rise to 5.88 to $1 by mid-2014, a rise of about 2 percent. That would be small by global currency market standards but unusually large for China.##2271|Eurozone inflation slowed in February to the level last seen in October, final data from Eurostat showed Monday.

Inflation fell to 0.7 percent in February from 0.8 percent in January. The flash estimate for February was revised down from 0.8 percent.

The figure has been staying below the European Central Bank's target of 'below, but close to 2 percent' for the thirteenth consecutive month.

Meanwhile, core inflation came in line with preliminary estimate. Core inflation rose to 1 percent from 0.8 percent a month ago.

On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices climbed 0.3 percent and core prices moved up 0.5 percent.

Food, alcohol and tobacco prices advanced 1.5 percent and non-energy industrial goods prices gained 0.4 percent. Cost of services were up 1.3 percent from last year. However, energy prices declined 2.3 percent annually, following a 1.2 percent drop in the prior month.

Stock markets in Europe edged higher, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.2 per cent to recoup some of its 1.1 per cent drop in the previous session.



The move echoed trading in Asia, where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan managed to rise 0.5 per cent, clawing back half the previous day's losses.



Soft Chinese data dented many markets, however, with Japan's Nikkei slipping 0.1 per cent, erasing gains made after Japanese machinery orders beat expectations, and South Korean shares also erasing most of its gains.



China's industrial output growth came in below forecasts for the combined January/February period, with retail sales also weaker than expected, stoking worries that growth could slow as Beijing pushes for economic reforms.



"The China economy is slowing quite sharply, in our view... (although) the lack of inflation and slowing growth does open the door for policy easing," Gerard Lane, equity strategist at Shore Capital, said in a note.



The MSCI All-Country World index edged up 0.1 per cent, not far from an eight-day low hit on Wednesday.



A major victim of concerns over China, copper dropped 0.9 per cent to $6,448 a tonne, a day after it hit a four-year low at $6376.25.



After a tumble in copper of around 8 per cent so far this month, investors are worried about a possible unravelling of Chinese loan deals using the metal as collateral.



Euro: a new safe haven?



Traditional safe-haven assets remained firm even as stocks steadied, as the diplomatic stalemate between Russia and the West over Ukraine continued.



The European Union agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War.





Gold hit a six-month high of $1,374.85, while US Treasuries have erased all the losses made following last week's strong payrolls data. The benchmark 10-year yield was 2.72 per cent on Thursday versus its six-week high of 2.82 per cent hit last Friday.Geopolitical tension also supported oil. The European benchmark Brent held relatively firm at $107.88 as it drew support from the unfolding crisis over Ukraine.US crude futures steadied, although they remained near one-month lows hit on Wednesday after Washington announced a surprise plan for a test release of strategic oil reserves.In the currency market, the Swiss franc hit a two-and-a-half year high of 0.8697 francs to the dollar, while the Japanese yen, which is under pressure from the Bank of Japan's loose monetary policy, also ticked up slightly.The euro hit a new 2 1/2-year high of $1.3954, a possible sign that the currency is regaining safe-haven status as it recovers from the sovereign debt crisis.Irish government bond yields hit new record lows before Dublin's first regular debt auction since its 2010 bailout, seen as a post-crisis watershed for the country.Investors expected a solid auction result, which some said could be a catalyst for another leg in the Irish debt rally which has taken 10-year yields to just below 3 per cent from a peak of over 15 per cent in 2011."This return to domestic bond auctions is the final stage of Ireland regaining full access to capital markets," said Sandra Holdsworth, an investment manager at Kames Capital."We expect Thursday's auction to pass successfully... However, one note of caution: at current levels of yield there is little margin to protect investors should the economic outlook worsen or fiscal discipline be lost." Copyright @ Thomson Reuters 2014##2273|Mumbai: Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd dropped as much as 6.36% on BSE on Thursday after the US drug regulator issued an import alert against its Karkhadi plant in Gujarat, banning shipments from the factory that makes some pharma ingredients and formulations for the US market.

“This factory near Vadodara in Gujarat that makes a small quantity of antibiotics got an import alert on Thursday,” said a person at Sun Pharma familiar with the development. “But the revenue impact is very negligible.”

After falling to as low as Rs.565.60 on BSE in intra-trading, the shares closed 5.03% lower at Rs.573.60 on a day the exchange’s benchmark Sensex fell 0.37% to 21.774.61 points.

The contribution of the Karkhadi facility, near Vadodara, to Sun Pharma’s consolidated revenue is negligible, and the drug maker maintains its 2013-14 fiscal’s consolidated sales growth forecast, a Sun Pharma spokesman said in a statement.

“The company remains fully committed to compliance and has already initiated several corrective steps to address the observations made by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration),” the spokesperson said.

Sun Pharma manufactures active pharma ingredients and formulations at its Karkhadi unit. The drug maker operates some 12 US-approved factories—six in the US, three in India and one each in Canada, Israel and Hungry, and it has sufficient manufacturing capacity to serve export markets.

“Thus, the company has well diversified manufacturing infrastructure to cater to the US markets, which contribute around 54% to its sales,” said sector analyst Sarabjit Kour Nangra at Angel Broking Ltd.

Sun Pharma’s subsidiaries, including Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd and the recently acquired DUSA Pharmaceuticals Inc., among others, currently account for a major chunk of sales and growth.

“We estimate the impact of the import alert on Sun Pharma’s Karkhadi plant at less than 1% of Sun’s total sales,” said Balaji Prasad, a sector analyst with Barclays Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.

“However, we note that Sun’s premium valuations yield limited down-side support should such operational risks become repetitive.”

The FDA alert on Sun Pharma’s Karkhadi plant was a follow-up to observations from the last inspection of the regulator in December and is related to the non-compliance with current good manufacturing practices.

Sun Pharma resolved a much larger issue of similar nature at a US factory belonging to its subsidiary Caraco in 2013 after a nearly six-year long compliance exercise. It’s the first such FDA action it’s facing in India in several years.

The US regulator, which has expanded its inspection network in India by adding more people to the team and also by initiating surprise inspections, had issued import alerts on at least half a dozen drug manufacturing units in the last couple of years.

India’s largest drug maker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd has been the worst hit by FDA actions in the recent past; the US drug regulator banned its export-oriented formulation unit at Mohali and the active ingredients factory at Toansa, both in Punjab, in the last seven months.

Ranbaxy signed a consent decree with the US drug regulator to become compliant with quality regulations at two of its larger Indian factories, located at Poanta Sahib and Dewas in Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, respectively, which were under an import ban since 2008.

It also paid a penalty of $500 million to the US department of justice in 2012 after the company was charged with fabrication of documents and selling adulterated drugs in the American market. Ranbaxy has lost nearly $1 billion of US business annually since 2010 because of regulatory issues.##2274|Overall, mortgage rates on the majority of HSBC Bank’s (NYSE:HSBC) home loans improved this mid-week, the lender’s rate information revealed.

The Bank urgently needed female representation in its senior policymaking circles. And it doesn’t look like tokenism. Shafik will sit on all of the key committees and will oversee the Bank’s exit from quantitative easing.

Ben Broadbent’s promotion to Deputy Governor for monetary policy, replacing Charlie Bean, means another Goldman Sachs alumnus (like Carney) rises.

The developer of the irresistibly addictive game, King Digital Entertainment, wants to sell 22.2 million shares between $21 and $24 in its IPO, placing it ahead of its rival and last game giant to go public, Zynga. Candy Crush’s maker King initially filed for the IPO last month.

The company saw an average of 144 million daily active users playing its games more than 1.4 billion times a day—an increase from 128 million daily active users playing more than 1.2 billion times in December.

King’s target valuation for its IPO would set it behind more established gaming players like Electronic Arts ($9.2 billion valuation) and Activision Blizzard ($14.3 billion).

[WSJ]##2278|Empty##2279|Vodafone has agreed to buy Spain’s largest cable operator Ono in a deal worth just over £6 billion.

The acquisition, funded in part by the proceeds from the sale of its US arm, will see Vodafone take on 1.9 million customers, and create a stronger challenger to Spanish market leader Telefonica.

The deal for private equity-owned Ono is Vodafone’s third purchase of a European fixed-broadband business in two years and will enable it to offer fixed-line and mobile services, pay-TV and broadband. Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said the deal represented an “attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone”.

The agreement, which comes as the French market undergoes a similar transformation, could also spark more consolidation within Spain as players such as France’s Orange seek out acquisitions to avoid falling behind. According to the Spanish regulator, Vodafone had almost 25 per cent of the mobile market there. The deal, which includes Ono’s 1.1 million mobile customers, is likely to increase that by almost 2 percentage points. Orange has around 23 per cent of the market.

Ono, which had been in the process of preparing for a stock market flotation, has a network that covers 70 per cent of Spanish households.##2280|KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA – It’s been five days since Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared into thin air, and the mystery is deepening every day.

Officials are expanding their search yet again, with 12 countries now scouring 27,000 square miles of land and water in southeast Asia.

Now it seems the expansive search may be paying off — a Chinese satellite looking into the disappearance “has observed a suspected crash area at sea,” a Chinese agency said.

While those possible findings develop, Colorado-based company DigitalGlobe is enlisting the public`s help by pointing satellites at the search area and posting the images online.

Additionally, an oil rig worker claims he may have seen the plane go down off the coast of Vietnam.

He said in a letter to his employer that he saw something “burning at high altitude” around the time the plane disappeared.

Vietnamese authorities sent an aircraft to investigate, but no word on any findings yet.

Meanwhile, family members desperate for news of their loved ones are growing increasingly upset.

“My son, you need to find him, you need to search quicker,” one distraught father shouted at authorities.

Officials say they are doing all they can, but that is small comfort to family members desperately trying to cling to hope.##2281|DENVER — Denver-based Quiznos has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reduce its debt by more than $400 million after the chain lost ground to competitors.

DENVER — Denver-based Quiznos has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reduce its debt by more than $400 million after the chain lost ground to competitors.

The toasted sandwich company said Friday that it voluntarily filed to reorganize to implement a pre-packaged restructuring plan.

Quiznos says the move won’t affect its customers.

The company only owns and operates seven of the nearly 2,100 Quiznos restaurants. The rest are owned and operated by franchisees and aren’t part of the bankruptcy proceedings.

Quiznos also says its distribution centers are open and fulfilling orders.

Quiznos, founded in 1981, says the restructuring plan has been approved by its creditors so it expects to emerge from reorganization quickly.

Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic, Inc., a food industry consulting firm, said Quiznos operates in a crowded field where other “fast casual” choices for consumers include Jimmy Johns, Firehouse and Jersey Mike’s. All were hurt by the recession, but Quiznos had added pressure from franchisees, several of whom have filed lawsuits accusing the company of putting corporate profits ahead of the concerns of franchise owners.

In a statement about its Chapter 11 filing, Quiznos CEO Stuart Mathis said the company was taking steps to support franchisees that included reducing food costs and making loans available to some franchise owners for restaurant improvements.

Tristano said that while Quiznos might be able to slow its decline, the chances of returning to its heyday, when more than 4,000 Quiznos restaurants were operating, are slim.

“There’s too much competition,” Tristano said.##2282|Seeing the words “Congressional investigation” paired with the name of your company is never a good thing. Such was the case for General Motors (NYSE: GM) late Monday, when the company found itself the target of a government committee poised to investigate GM admissions it knew in 2004 about a deadly problem with the ignition switch in certain GM vehicles, but failed to issue a recall until 10 years later.

Despite 250 complaints from drivers about the faulty ignition switch, neither the carmaker nor regulatory authorities acted on those complaints until February of this year when General Motors issued a recall. The deaths of 13 drivers have been linked to the faulty ignition.

Because of this, Michigan congressional representative Fred Upton (R) announced Monday that the House Energy and Commerce Committee would launch an investigation designed to gather “detailed information” from both General Motors and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

Related: GM Financial Expanding Into Prime Loans

The investigation, which Upton said would take place in coming weeks, would seek to determine whether General Motors or federal regulators failed to follow regulations designed to protect the public.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Upton said, "Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner? If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended."

Upton is no stranger to auto safety legislation having served as lead sponsor of the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability,and Documentation (TREAD) Act in 2000. The TREAD Act came in response to a series of accidents involving Ford (NYSE: F) sport-utility vehicles and requires automakers to quickly report fatal accidents related to safety defects

General Motors said Monday it had hired Chicago lawyer, Anton Valukas, to lead the company’s internal investigation into the recall. Clearly, GM had an eye on being as proactive as possible under the circumstances.

Meanwhile, although GM released a chronology describing how the ignition switch problem was discovered that information does not reveal who was responsible for the fact the recall didn’t occur until a decade after the defect was first reported.

The NHTSA has also not explained why that agency didn’t initiate action after officials pointed out the problem in 2007.

King, which has a major office near Tottenham Court Road in London but is domiciled in Dublin, yesterday announced a price of between $21 and $24 per share for its initial public offering, valuing it at $6.6bn to $7.56bn, much more than the $5bn initially estimated.

If King reaches the top end of its valuation the company will be worth more than FTSE 100 stalwarts such as the water utility Severn Trent, sugar giant Tate & Lyle and car insurer Admiral. King made a profit of $568m last year on revenue of $1.88bn, but its stock market filings admitted that 78 per cent of this came from its game Candy Crush Saga.

Commentators in the US press have expressed doubts over the longevity of the business given its reliance on the one game, with The Atlantic Magazine calling the company a "horrible investment". This week's New Yorker also called King "part of a venerable tradition: the one-hit wonder" and drew parallels to the disastrous float of the Facebook gaming firm Zynga in 2011.

Zynga was valued at $7bn on its debut, then the biggest tech float since Google's, but saw its value collapse as games such as Farmville declined in popularity. The company is currently worth $4.7bn.

Tech investors last night defended King's valuation, denying it would be a repeat of Zynga. One London-based venture capitalist said the company was not a "flash in the pan", pointing out: "It's more than a decade old and had been cash-flow positive since 2005."

The spreadbetting firm ETX Capital has been running a grey market for King, which ahead of yesterday's pricing announcement valued the company at between $6.82bn and $9.32bn.

Another London-based investor suggested that "with the resources as a public company King could be a long-term winner". The company is hoping to raise $533m from its stock market listing.

King was founded in 2003 by Riccardo Zacconi and Toby Rowland, son of the former Lonrho chief executive and Observer newspaper owner Roland "Tiny" Rowland. The company originally developed small-stakes gambling games for sites such as Yahoo and MSN, before launching games on Facebook and mobile.

The smartphone version of its hit Candy Crush Saga, launched in 2012, has been downloaded more than half a billion times.

Eleven executives and directors at King will be worth a combined $2.2bn if it achieves the top end of its valuation. Mr Zaccconi, the chief executive, stands to make up to $745m, while the chairman, Mel Morris, a former Derby County football club director, will make more than $870m.

The London venture capital firm Apax Partners' stake could be valued at up to $3.4bn while the investor Index Ventures will see its holding valued at as much as $599m.##2284|* Countries grapple for deal to prevent embarrassing delay

* Ministers to debate scheme to close banks

* Much still up for grabs, including imposing investor losses

By Jan Strupczewski and John O’Donnell

BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - European governments and lawmakers will try to reach a deal this week on how to wind down failing banks, clearing the way for a landmark reform as time runs out to win European Parliament approval before May elections.

Negotiations are set to span days and may be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for euro zone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one pot of money to pay for it.

“There will not be an outcome today or tomorrow, because the real negotiations will take place on Wednesday and days after that if necessary,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is chairing Monday’s meeting of euro ministers, told reporters, referring to talks with the European Parliament’s lawmakers.

As he entered for the first day of talks with European counterparts, Spain’s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said he was optimistic agreement could be clinched.

Talks on a new European agency to shut down failing banks, and on a fund to pay for such closures, need to be agreed before the last sitting of the European Parliament in mid-April.

Failure to do so would delay the law by at least seven months, and probably more. It could also mean it is scrutinised by a new group of lawmakers with a higher count of eurosceptics, as such parties are expected to do well in the May poll.

The banking union, and the clean-up of banks’ books that will accompany it, is intended to restore banks’ confidence in one another and boost lending across the currency bloc, helping foster growth in the 18 economies that use the euro.

“This is a large scale political project which will allow countries to borrow at the same rate whether you are Spanish, Italian, German or French,” French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici told reporters.

New lending has been throttled by banks’ efforts to raise capital and cut their risks in recession.

The banking union is also supposed to break the vicious circle of indebted states and the banks that buy their debt, treated in law as ‘risk-free’ despite Greece’s default in all but name.

Euro zone banks now hold about 1.75 trillion euros of government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to the European Central Bank. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the banking system is now on loan to governments.

The biggest political reform since the launch of the euro currency, banking union also touches on sensitive issues for investors, including the imposition of losses on bondholders of failing banks.

Policymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank will be the supervisor for euro zone banks, a role it takes on in November.

In return for giving its blessing to the wider scheme, Germany wants to see losses imposed from that point onwards on bondholders and others who have backed troubled banks.

TUG OF WAR

Officials caution that a deal may not be possible this week and could be postponed until the end of the month.

To further complicate matters, European governments disagree not only amongst themselves, but also with the European Parliament, which must give its blessing to the project before it can become law.

At the heart of the dispute is the complex process of closing a bank. Countries are reluctant to cede authority to Brussels and want a laborious system of checks before any decision to shut a bank can be taken.

EU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the euro zone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that the decision must then be signed into law by the finance ministers.

Under that scenario, if the ministers want to change the board’s decision, they also have to involve the European Commission and start a procedure so complex that it is doubtful it can be completed quickly.

The European Parliament, on the other hand, wants no involvement of EU ministers, arguing it would politicise the process and make it cumbersome. It wants leave the final go-ahead to the more impartial European Commission.

Parliament also wants the ECB - the supervisor of all banks - to be the only institution to declare a bank is failing. EU governments want the agency board and national authorities to have a say.

Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the ‘resolution’ fund, used to cover the costs of shutting a bank, and how soon countries should be able to dip into the pot. The fund will be filled by euro zone banks and is slated to reach around 55 billion euros ($76 billion).

Governments want the fund to reach full size over 10 years, while the parliament wants the fund to be fully available to all euro zone countries after just three years.

Finally, policymakers must decide if they will allow this fund to borrow if it is short of cash, or if it should borrow from the euro zone bailout fund or receive state guarantees.##2285|SAC Capital to rename as Point72 Asset Management, memo says

Steven A. Cohen is changing the name of his SAC Capital Advisors to Point72 Asset Management as the hedge-fund firm stops managing client money to settle U.S. allegations of insider trading.

The firm, which will manage billionaire Cohen's own fortune after the transition, is being renamed effective next month, President Thomas Conheeney said in a memo to employees Tuesday. The new name refers to the address of SAC's headquarters at 72 Cummings Point Road in Stamford.

"In the aftermath of our settlement with the government, Steve and senior management considered whether our path forward as a family office would be simpler if we operated with new legal entities and new names," Conheeney said.

SAC agreed in November to pay a record $1.8 billion and plead guilty to securities fraud to settle allegations of insider trading. As part of the settlement, Cohen, 57, agreed to close SAC and return client money. Six former employees have pleaded guilty to insider trading, and two others, Michael Steinberg and Mathew Martoma, were found guilty in the last three months of using illegal tips to profit.

Cohen started SAC -- the name is derived from his initials -- in 1992. SAC's two new equity-trading units will do business as Point72 Asset Management and EverPoint Asset Management, Conheeney said in the memo.

"The name emphasizes we point to a successful future that rests on the exacting analyses of the companies, sectors and verticals by Point72's portfolio managers and analysts," Conheeney said. "We have selected strong new names that reflect our heritage or signal something important about our businesses."

SAC's quantitative-trading business will be called Cubist Systematic Strategies, a reference to the early 20th-century European avant-garde art genre. Cohen, a Greenwich resident, owns an extensive art collection, including works by Pablo Picasso.

Ted Pyne and Perry Boyle will oversee the firm's global equity business, while Angus Wai will continue to run its Asian unit, according to a memo sent to employees last month. Ben Cohen will continue to head the firm's macroeconomic trading unit, Steve Rosen will still lead the Boston office and Ross Garon will remain in charge of quantitative investing. Andy Cohen will keep overseeing the founder's private investments that will be called Cohen Private Ventures.

The firm's businesses in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo will be known as Point72 Asia Asset Management, while some teams in the region will operate under the name of EverPoint Asia Asset Management, Tuesday's memo said. SAC said in October it would close its London office.

The firm said last month that it had returned almost all investor money as of the end of January, leaving it to manage the private wealth of Cohen, which is estimated at $8.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index. It also said it had shrunk its head count to 850 people from 1,000.

Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen, declined to comment on the name change, which was first reported by the New York Times.##2286|Empty##2287|EU car sales are picking up, but off a very low base

Data issued by ACEA shows that the EU car market rose by 8% year-on-year in February, the sixth consecutive monthly increase.

However, ACEA also noted that in absolute figures, the total of 861,058 units registered marked the second lowest result to date for a month of February since ACEA began the series in 2003 with the enlarged EU.

From January to February, new passenger car registrations increased by 6.6%, totalling 1,796,787 units.

In February 2014, France was the only major market to face a downturn (-1.4%). All other significant markets contributed positively to the overall 8.0% expansion of the EU market, with growth ranging from +3.0% in the UK, +4.3% in Germany, +8.6% in Italy to +17.8% in Spain.

Carlos Da Silva, IHS analyst, said that the result was no surprise. "This confirms that the long awaited revival of the European market is on track," he said.

But he also warned that current sales levels are at historical lows.

"European sales need to strengthen further," he said. "So that all the players reap the fruits of the recovery. So far sales have effectively been growing but discounting practices have been following a very similar path, it seems... This would tend to indicate that the overall situation remains more tense than it might appear."

Volkswagen last week noted the fiercely competitive conditions that persist in Europe and are acting as a drag on profitability.

LMC Automotive forecasts that the West European car market will grow by 3% in 2014 to 11.9m units, still well under 14m+ pre-crisis 'norms'.

However, adjustable-rate mortgages, with their low introductory interest rate, have been rebounding recently in loan the market.

In the past year, rate for the 30-year fixed mortgages climbed from about 3.4 percent in February 2013 to about 4.1 percent in February 2014. This upward trend will continue and likely reach 5 percent before the end of 2014, says Erin Lantz, director of the Zillow Mortgage Marketplace.

On the other hand, 5/1 ARMs still show near historical low introductory rates, around 2.75 percent in February 2014, which seems more appealing to homebuyers.

Particularly, for buyers plan to move or sell their houses within few years, hybrid ARMs could be financially advantageous, since they provide extended initial period with a fixed-rate from three to ten years, says Len Kiefer, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac.

According to Freddie Mac’s ARM Annual Survey, in January 2014 the interest-rate savings for a 5/1 hybrid ARM with a 30-year term compared to the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage amounted to about 1.36 percentage points. On a $250,000 loan, this results in $194 in principal and interest savings during the first five years of the ARM loan versus a fixed-rate mortgage.

However, homebuyers should be wary of possible risk that interest rate can go up after fixed-rate period ends.

Interest rates will increase as Federal Reserve System begin to taper its quantitative easing as the economy continues to show signs of improvement, says Kiefer.

Moreover, if home prices drop unexpectedly, a buyer could wind up getting negative equity, lose its selling point and be stuck in a mortgage with a rate that adjusts higher, as experienced during housing bust, says Lantz.

As always, buy a house that you can comfortably afford. If a buyer qualifies for an ARM, consider one with longer fixed periods, such as 7/1 or 10/1 ARMs, which can give a leeway in case that circumstances change.

Wednesday, the makers of the popular smartphone game Candy Crush Saga filed for an initial public offering. Dublin-based King Digital Entertainment plans to offer more than 22 million shares, priced at $21 to $24 U.S. each.



Some 15.5 million shares will come from the company, which expects to receive around $326 million U.S. from the offering. Existing shareholders will sell the balance of the shares.



King Digital said it plans to use the funds for working capital and acquisitions. It has applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KING.



Based on these estimates, King Digital’s implied market capitalization would fall between about $6.6 billion to $7.6 billion U.S. Rival mobile game developer Zynga Inc. (NASDAQ: ZNGA), which held its IPO in 2011, currently has a market cap just shy of $5 billion U.S.

Cohen Tuesday sought to turn a page following an insider-trading scandal, announcing plans to rename the firm that bears his initials.

The once-mighty investment firm, which agreed in November to plead guilty to criminal charges of insider trading, will rename itself Point72 Asset Management, SAC president Tom Conheeney said in a memo to employees.

The name change takes effect April 7 and comes as the firm transitions from a hedge fund into a "family office" to manage Cohen's fortune and that of some family members and employees.

"In the aftermath of our settlement with the government, Steve and senior management considered whether our path forward as a family office would be simpler if we operated with new legal entities and new names," Conheeney said.

"We concluded it would."

The name alludes to the company's street address of 72 Cummings Point Road in Stamford, Connecticut, which is expected to "be our home for many years to come," Conheeney said.

SAC in November agreed to pay $1.8 billion to settle criminal charges in the long-running case. Eight former SAC officials have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty of insider trading.

Cohen has not been charged criminally, but faces a civil allegations that he failed to effectively manage employees.

Conheeney's memo alluded to the company's travails.

"We have been through a great deal during the past few years," he said. "Our new names, combined with the other changes we have announced, are intended to help us to move forward."##2293|##2294|Here are some suggestions that matches your entry. Click "Search" for more results.

Reports##2295|Empty##2296|As news out of Ukraine seemed to drift to the periphery, stocks edged lower today on trade data from China, though U.S. equities mostly weathered the storm thanks in part to M&A news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) finished the day down 34 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both dropped less than 0.1%.

The world's No. 2 economy said exports fell unexpectedly in February, declining by 18.1% against analyst expectations of a 6.8% rise. It was enough to push the Hong Kong-based Hang Seng down 1.8%, and put pressure on commodities as China is seen as the world's manufacturer, and thus the biggest consumer of raw materials. There were no economic reports released in the U.S., but investors cheered an all-stock merger announcement between Chiquita Brands and Ireland-based Fyffes, which will create the world's largest banana company. Chiquita share finished up 11%, while Fyffes jumped a whopping 52% as the two groups of shareholders will split ownership of the new company nearly evenly.

Among stocks making news today was Boeing (NYSE:BA), which was down near 3% most of the day and finished down 1.3% after the company reported new production issues with its 787 Dreamliner jet. This time, the manufacturer said it had found hairline cracks in the wings of 43 planes. The problems is just the latest in a long series of mechanical flaws, the most serious of which have been battery fires on aircraft that were already deployed. The hairline cracks were found on planes that were still in production, however. Separately, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 jet went missing on Saturday and has not been found, though that jet is considered one of the safest in use.

Elsewhere, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) shares were sliding after hours, down 2% after its earnings report came out. The clothing retailer actually beat earnings estimates, posting a per-share profit of $0.59 against expectations of $0.55. Revenues, meanwhile, grew 5.7% to $905.9 million, in line with its earnings pre-announcement, but below the old analyst consensus at $925.7 million. Same-store sales, which include e-commerce, increased 1%, but fell 9% at namesake Urban Outfitters stores. Comps were stronger at Free People and Anthropologie, moving up 20% and 10%, respectively. Considering the struggles that retailers faced over the holiday season, especially teen apparel vendors, this was not such a shabby report as profits improved to a new record alongside revenue. The company did not provide guidance for the current year, but CEO sounded optimistic, saying, "customer reaction to the new spring fashion offerings at our Anthropologie and Free People brands have been strong," but was cautious on the business overall because of "challenges" at Urban Outfitters stores.##2297|CLOSE

The Melville, N.Y.-based national chain of more than 800 eateries said its prepackaged reorganization plan has the backing of 98% of its lenders, who are providing $20M in financing and eliminating $140M in debt for substantially all the equity in the company.

Sbarro, owned by buyout firm MidOcean Partners since 2007, last month moved to close 155 of its locations in a bid to stave off bankruptcy.

Dilenschneider principal Jonathan Dedmon, based in Chicago, handles the Sbarro account.

In a statement, Sbarro CEO David Karam was optimistic about the company's future. "The agreement among the company's lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months," he said. "The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success, and today's filing is a necessary step to achieve those goals."



Sard Verbinnen & Co worked its 2011 bankruptcy.##2299|Germany’s Constitutional Court has confirmed the legality of the euro zone’s bailout fund, upholding a preliminary ruling from the height of the debt crisis in 2012 that gave an initial green light to the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

The court reiterated that the €700 billion fund did not violate the rights of the Bundestag lower house of parliament to decide on budgetary matters as long as the lower house of parliament had sufficient oversight powers over the ESM. “The result is clear: the constitutional complaint...is inadmissible and on top of that unfounded,” said the president of the court, Andreas Vosskuhle, standing to read the verdict along with his red-robed colleagues in the courtroom.

“Despite the liabilities assumed, the budgetary autonomy of the German Bundestag is sufficiently safeguarded,” he told the court in Karlsruhe in south-western Germany.

There had been concerns expressed that a threat to the functioning of the fund would have had major ramifications, not just for the euro zone as a whole, but particularly for Ireland, which is seeking retrspective direct recapitalisation for AIB and Bank of Ireland from the fund.

The court said measures had been taken to ensure Germany’s liability to the

ESM was limited to €190 billion , with any increase subject to approval or veto by the Bundestag.

The more than 35,000 plaintiffs included academics and lawmakers from chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc and the opposition, who argued that the ESM amounts to an illegal transfer of sovereignty from Berlin to Brussels.

The Constitutional Court has a history of delaying EU treaties to test their compatibility with German law, usually reaching the conclusion that parliament has to be consulted fully and taxpayers’ liabilities must be limited.

As expected,Mr Vosskuhle did not make any direct comments on the legality of the European Central Bank’s “unlimited” bond-buying scheme, the flagship emergency measure taken since the debt crisis began four years ago.

The German court took the unprecedented decision last month to defer a ruling on the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme - which is credited with saving the euro zone - to the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg.##2300|Empty##2301|This will appear next to all of your comments

Last year gold lost 29 per cent of its value. It ended the year at US$1,205.62, but in each of the last three quarters of 2013 it bounced back from below $1,200. The interesting fact is not that it failed to maintain a price below $1,200 – it was who was buying into the precious metal.

Professional investors were still exiting the market, so it could only be private buyers, including a large number of Middle East investors. This was confirmed by data released by the World Gold Council. It reported that many of the institutional 400-ounce delivery bars had to be broken into smaller units, as most of the demand was coming from individuals.

The events at the start of the year have proved to be very good news for these private investors. The current tensions in Ukraine are a reminder that gold is always the last safe haven investment. As the West’s barrage of verbal threats was met with Russia’s actions, investors and traders alike have focused on a gold price heading back towards $1,400. Last month, a gold call option on the US Comex exchange, with a right to buy at $1,400 an ounce, traded an average of 427 contracts a day. Last Tuesday, in one day the same option traded 4,547 lots.

At the start of January, based on the increasing bullish investor sentiment, our published forecast for gold prices in the first quarter highlighted the potential for a move to $1,400. We see no sign of any change to this bullish forecast and in fact we have revised this to $1,438, equal to a recovery of 50 per cent of all the losses last year. If prices reach this level, the market will record the largest quarterly improvement since 2007.

The dramatic events in the Crimea contrasted with slowly building doubts over the recovery in the US. Many commentators had hoped that poor economic figures in January were down to the weather, but this may not be the case. We could be faced with the US economy slowing in reaction to the tapering of the fiscal quantitative easing programme.

Perhaps the most important development has been the return of one the key pillars of bullish gold sentiment. Gold’s price rise this year caught the professional investment community off -guard, but there are now signs it has stopped selling. Last month the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold, reported its first monthly inflow of metal in more than a year. It received more than 10.5 tonnes as investors slowly returned to buying.

The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said hedge funds raised their bullish positions on gold futures contracts by 17 per cent in the week ended February 11. US Securities and Exchange Commission filings also revealed that the billionaire George Soros bought a large number of shares in the world’s biggest gold miner.

Underpinned by strong private investor sentiment, global turmoil, economic developments and the return of professional traders, all the metal now needs is strong physical demand this year.

The WGC reports that gold demand in India rose 13 per cent last year and China’s demand is rising so fast it needs to build more storage facilities. Hong Kong is to build a 1,500-tonne depository and open a new physical bullion trading exchange in the mainland later this year.

It is not often that professional investors have to take their lead from private buyers, but this is the case with gold at the moment. Internationally and regionally, private buyers of gold should be very pleased with their investments.

World stocks paused near a six-year peak and commodities from copper to crude tumbled yesterday as surprisingly weak Chinese trade data rattled investors already on edge over the crisis in Ukraine.

Relief that Crimea remained calm over the weekend helped EU shares rally 0.2 percent after Friday’s sharp sell-off, although poor Chinese export numbers provided a subdued backdrop.

Merger activity in France spurred the CAC40, but mining firms sensitive to China’s appetite for raw materials weighed on Britain’s FTSE 100 and German firms’ exposure to Russia saw the DAX underperform again.

“People sold on Friday on fear of an escalation in Crimea, but things seem to have stabilised now so it’s tempting to buy the dip,” David Thebault at Global Equities in Paris said.

Investors in Asia started the week on a cautious note as China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled 18 percent year on year last month, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown.

The soft data put a damper on risk sentiment, which had been buoyed briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report that had provided a welcome respite from a run of weak data.

China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 percent to its lowest level in almost nine months. Copper, of which China is a major consumer, hit a four-year low in Shanghai, while the commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars suffered.

MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1.4 percent, its biggest fall in over a month. Tokyo’s Nikkei shed 1 percent, as disappointing Japanese gross domestic product data added to woes.

The Chinese trade data weighed on currency markets.

The yuan opened down 0.5 percent and Chinese short-term rates fell amid speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly economic growth.

The Australian and Canadian dollars lost as much as half a percent against a broadly steady US dollar.

“The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this [yesterday] morning – you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,” Alvin Tan at Société Générale in London said.

The euro, in contrast, stayed within striking distance of Friday’s two-and-a-half-year peak at $1.3875, touched after the European Central Bank suggested last week that the euro zone recovery was on track. That pushed rate cut bets back.

People are driving less, and some say we really are at peak car. So how are people getting around? It turns out a lot more people are taking transit, the most in 57 years. The American Public Transportation Association is jubilant:

"Last year people took 10.7 billion trips on public transportation. As the highest annual ridership number since 1956, Americans in growing numbers want to have more public transit services in their communities,” said Peter Varga, APTA Chair and CEO of The Rapid in Grand Rapids, MI. “Public transportation systems nationwide – in small, medium, and large communities – saw ridership increases. Some reported all-time high ridership numbers.”



The stats are pretty impressive:

Since 1995 public transit ridership is up 37.2 percent, outpacing population growth, which is up 20.3 percent, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which is up 22.7 percent.

Often people claim that the lousy economy makes people take cheaper transit rather than drive. The APTA claims the opposite:

Another reason behind the ridership increases is the economic recovery in certain areas. When more people are employed, public transportation ridership increases since nearly 60 percent of the trips taken on public transportation are for work commutes.”

Toronto opponents of light rail should note that the statistics here are pretty impressive. One can go on and on about how light rail has more stops that are closer together so that it can do a better (and cheaper) job of serving neighborhoods than subways can.

Light rail (modern streetcars, trolleys, and heritage trolleys) ridership increased 1.6 percent in 2013 with 17 out of 27 transit systems reporting increases. Systems that showed double digit increases in 2013 were located in the following cities: New Orleans, LA (28.9%); Denver, CO (14.9%); and San Diego, CA (10.4%). Ridership in the following cities also saw increases in 2013: Seattle, WA – Sound Transit (9.8%); Pittsburgh, PA (7.5%); Salt Lake City, UT (6.8%); Los Angeles, CA (6.0%); San Jose, CA (3.6%); and Philadelphia, PA (3.5%).

U.S. consumer sentiment weakened in early March as an unusually harsh winter appeared to dim views on the economy's prospects.The preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell to 79.9 in March from 81.6 the prior month, a survey showed on Friday.Analysts had expected sentiment to improve, and the weak tone of the report could be a sign that severe weather had put consumers in the doldrums. That would back the view that the U.S. economy was only temporarily stuck in a soft patch and would resume stronger growth once the weather improves."Most of the decline ... can be attributed to the unseasonably bad weather," said Amna Asaf, an economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.Parts of the United States have suffered colder-than-normal temperatures and blizzards over the winter, which may have contributed to several months of weak hiring.If weather is the culprit, then the Federal Reserve can feel more confident about continuing the winding down of a bond-buying stimulus program. The Fed started trimming monthly bond purchases in January.The sentiment index was at its lowest level since November. It was largely dragged down by a dip in consumer expectations for future growth.There were some signs of strength in the report. Those polled expected the highest rate of annual income gains since November 2008."Expectations of income gains were ... consistent with a tightening labor market," said Cooper Howes, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York.A separate report from the Labor Department pointed in the opposite direction with regard to inflation, as a decline in U.S. producer prices in February suggested little building of inflationary pressure.The government's seasonally adjusted producer price index for final demand dropped 0.1 percent last month.On its own, the price data would make policymakers feel more comfortable holding interest rates near zero for many more months."There is nothing in this report that raises any concerns about inflation," said John Canally, economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. "The economy is running too far below capacity for that to happen.U.S. inflation has held at a very low level in recent years because of a persistently high unemployment rate.The value of the U.S. dollar slipped against the yen following the price data's publication, suggesting investors felt the report buttressed the view that the Fed would hold interest rates extremely low into next year.Prices for U.S. stocks and yields on U.S. government debt fell on heightened tensions over a possible U.S.-European response against Russia if a referendum in Ukraine's Crimea region goes ahead.Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a slight increase in prices received last month by businesses such as factories, retailers and wholesalers. The price index had risen 0.2 percent in January.Final demand for goods rose 0.4 percent in February. Final demand for services dropped 0.3 percent. The Labor Department said about 80 percent of the decline in its services index was due to lower margins for retailers of apparel, footwear and accessories.In the 12 months through February, producer prices increased 0.9 percent, the smallest one-year gain since May 2013.Producer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs fell 0.2 percent. Another gauge of core producer prices — final demand less foods, energy, and trade services — nudged up 0.1 percent.##2320|This will appear next to all of your comments

This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser##2321|Empty##2322|Budapest - Germany&39;s highest court on Tuesday ruled once and for all that the European bailout fund is in line with the country&39;s constitution, throwing out a raft of objections by eurosceptics.

Confirming a preliminary ruling from September 2012, the Federal Constitutional Court issued its final judgement, saying it saw no obstacle to Germany taking part in the 500-billion-euro ($696-billion) European Stability Mechanism (ESM), set up to bail out troubled countries and their banks.

"The constitutional complaints ... lodged against the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism ... are partly inadmissible and for the remainder unfounded," the court ruled.

"Despite the liabilities assumed, the budgetary autonomy of the German Bundestag is sufficiently safeguarded," it said.

Nevertheless, presiding judge Andreas Vosskuhle insisted that the Bundestag or lower house of parliament must "remain the place in which autonomous decisions on revenue and expenditure are made, including those with regard to international and European liabilities."

"As before, it is a matter of finding a way out of the crisis that is sustainable, realistic and has democratic and constitutional backing," Vosskuhle said.

Since the eurozone turmoil began in 2010, eurosceptics have repeatedly asked the Constitutional Court in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe to rule on whether new EU crisis-fighting tools comply with Germany&39;s constitution.

The red-robed judges have always validated European decisions, or sent them to a European court, while reinforcing the German parliament&39;s right to be consulted.

Germany&39;s share of the ESM bailout fund amounts to 190 billion euros, more than that of any other country. Germany was one of the last countries in the region to ratify the rescue fund, in late 2012.

Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble welcomed the ruling, saying it would "boost confidence and strengthen credibility."

ESM managing director Klaus Regling said: "The decision of the German Constitutional Court is good for Europe and for Germany. This decision provides clarity."

In the run-up to its definitive judgement on Tuesday, there had been no suggestion the court -- which Chancellor Angela Merkel has always had to take into account in her decisions on European policy -- would deviate from the line it has taken so far.

In a separate ruling last month, however, the court for the first time passed a case up to the European level, the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ).

At issue was the European Central Bank&39;s OMT bond purchase programme, which eurosceptics had argued overstepped the central bank&39;s mandate and was tantamount to printing money.

In the court&39;s opinion, "there are important reasons to suggest that it goes beyond the ECB&39;s monetary policy mandate and infringes on the powers of the member states and contravenes the ban on monetary deficit financing," it argued.

Nevertheless, the court said it "believes it is possible" that limitations could be applied to the OMT programme in such a way as to make it compatible with EU law.

The constitutional court will issue its judgement on the OMT after the ECJ makes its ruling, not expected before mid-2015.

But observers said the ECJ as a European body was unlikely to overturn an anti-crisis measure that has been instrumental in restoring calm to the markets.

Analysts welcomed the constitutional court&39;s final ruling on the ESM on Tuesday.

"The decision removes remaining uncertainty about the ESM, which is an important part of the eurozone financial stability architecture," said Berenberg Bank economist Christian Schulz.

"But the 500-billion-euro ESM is not big enough to defend large countries like Italy against market turbulences," he cautioned, saying it had been the ECB&39;s OMT programme which had brought the single currency area back from the brink of a possible break-up of the euro.

BayernLB economist Stefan Kipar found that "all in all, today&39;s judgement comes as no surprise and will not restrict the ability of the ESM to act."

Natixis economist Johannes Gareis said the constitutional court considers the eurozone&39;s ESM rescue fund as legal, as long as parliament has sufficient oversight.

"In addition, the court reiterated that Germany&39;s liability must be limited to 190 billion euros, any more needs approval of parliament," he said.##2323|Chinese Premier Li Keqiang speaks at a press conference after the closing meeting of the second annual session of China's 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 13, 2014. (Xinhua/Chen Jianli

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said that his government will give a priority to the promotion of social fairness and the improvement of people's livelihood. [Special coverage]

"We need to meet people's basic living needs, to provide the last resort for people to fall back on in case of special difficulty, and to promote social fairness," Li said at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session, calling them three major tasks for the government this year.

"Those topics related to people's livelihood presents priority on the government's work agenda," he said.

Li said the government will endeavor to make China's medical insurance and basic old insurance schemes "truly portable and transferrable" to further expand their coverage in urban and rural areas.

The government is going to explore the possibility of raising the basic pension benefits at a proper time, he said.

The premier urged all the government employees to put the special needs of the people, such as those who run into special difficulty because of serious illnesses or sudden disasters, on the top of their mind.

"The government needs to take more effective measures to ensure equal opportunities in finding jobs and to level the playing field for people who want to start their own business," Li said.

He also said that the government needs to pay particular attention to education to ensure fairness at the very starting point.

"This year we have set the target of raising the proportion of rural students from poor areas enrolled in key universities and colleges by over 10 percent," he said.

The premier also vowed to further improve the poorly built and low performing schools in China's poor areas.

"The government needs to create conditions to ensure that each and every individual has an equal shot at a better life through hard work and that fairness and justice are truly realized even at the most primary level of society," he said.##2324|The Bank of England has held their base rate at 0.5% for a further month, with market analysts predicting that they will remain at their historic low until spring next year.

The announcement was made by the BOEís Monetary Policy Committee, who were making their first announcement about future policy since they changed the focus of their ëforward guidanceí last month away from unemployment.

Rates have now remained at their lowest ever value of 0.5% for 5 years now, during which time consumer spending levels have begun to pick up due to households capitalising on low cost loans.

Last month, the Bank announced that it would be altering its forward guidance policy so that the future of interest rates are no longer attached to unemployment, instead identifying that itís trajectory would be based on a variety of factors such as wage growth, economic performance and labour productivity.

The change in the Bankís flagship policies scope has garnered widespread criticism, with the informal tag of ëfuzzy guidanceí being given to it due to its seeming lack of a concrete focus.

Nevertheless, the Bank have made it clear that they will retain rates for as long as they deem necessary, citing that they will not buckle to persistent calls to raise them earlier than 2015.

ëEarly rate rise would undermine recoveryí

Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The Bank of England clearly wants to nurture recovery and not to risk choking it off by raising interest rates too early or too fast.”

Mr Archer forecasted that rates will likely increase by around 1% during 2015, and will then climb to 2% by the end of 2016.

A number of leading economists have called for rates to be raised this year, highlighting the staggering fall in unemployment and the countryís growth forecasts as clear evidence that 2014 is the right time to instigate a rise.

However, many consumer groups, and indeed the Bank of England itself have reiterated the sentiment that the slow growth in worker wages and the high levels of personal debt currently make it an unsuitable time to instigate a rise, as lower earners with high levels of liabilities will find their wages ësqueezedí even further than they are now.

This has been argued by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), who called for the Bank to proceed with caution when implementing rate rises, and urged them to not raise them any quicker than 2015 so that businesses, consumers and industries have ample time to prepare and adjust to the transition of higher rates.

“The continued clamour for early rate rises is unwelcome and undermines the benefits of forward guidance to business, consumers and the markets,” said David Kern, the BCC’s chief economist.

“Even though we are getting closer to pre-recession GDP levels, this does not mean that the economy is back to normal.

The Bank has also argued that the current economic recovery is ëunsustainableí and is based around consumer spending that has been incurred from capitalising on low rate loans. By including labour productivity and real wages as parameters in which to monitor when considering rate rises, the Bank are clearly indicating that they are waiting for the UK to begin displaying real and sustainable growth before they subject people to harsher financial conditions.##2325|Empty##2326|TOKYO - Toyota said Monday it has suspended production at its two Indian auto assembly plants in response to threats against management and "deliberate" assembly-line stoppages, as efforts to hammer out a labour deal failed.

Toyota says it has suspended production at its two Indian auto assembly plants following labour unrest (File photo)

The world's biggest automaker said the move will see the lock-out of about 6,400 employees at the factories in southern India.

Company and union officials had been trying to sign a new contract for the past 10 months, with the local government helping mediate negotiations.

"In the meantime, under the instigation of the union, certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days," Toyota said in a statement.

"All these unlawful activities have been detailed in the lock-out notice. With this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lock-out of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," it added.

A Tokyo-based company spokesman said Toyota hoped to restart production quickly. But he could not give a timeline for any re-opening of the plants, which make a range of models including the flagship Camry sedan, the Corolla and the Prius hybrid.

The two factories, near the city of Bangalore, produce about 310,000 units annually, Toyota said.

The fresh strife comes as Japan looks to boost ties with India to counter-balance China's growing influence in the region.

- Closer Japan-India ties -

But the experience of Japanese firms in India has not always been rosy.

In a 2012 riot at Maruti Suzuki's Manesar plant near New Delhi saw workers chase supervisors with iron rods, killing a personnel manager and injuring close to 100 other managers.

The riot, which workers' representatives at the time said was caused by unhappiness over wages and working conditions, saw India's leading carmaker by sales lock out workers for a month and cost Maruti some $250 million in lost production.

The Toyota spokesman said there had not been any reports of physical abuse of managers or workers at its now-shuttered plants.

Separately, Japanese pharmaceutical giant Daiichi Sankyo has struggled with its majority ownership of Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy since buying it in 2008.

Last week, Ranbaxy shares tumbled following news of a second recall of its cholesterol-busting generic drug. The company is already reeling from a string of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) import bans involving manufacturing safety worries.

The FDA has banned Ranbaxy from sending drugs and ingredients to the United States, its biggest market, from four of its plants for failing to meet "good manufacturing practices".

Earlier this year, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe went to New Delhi to push for closer commercial and strategic ties with India, as Tokyo seeks to offset Beijing's growing regional might.

Tokyo is a major investor in India, pumping in about $15 billion in the past dozen years and involved in building the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, a huge $90-billion project linking India's capital with its financial hub.

Since coming to power in late 2012 Abe has trotted the globe, partly in his self-appointed role as salesman for Japan Inc., but also to seek offset the growing influence globally of China.##2327|Empty##2328|French mobile operator Bouygues Telecom has submitted a revised offer for Vivendi’s telecoms unit SFR. According to a company press release, Bouygues Telecom proposes to lift its initial offer by EUR1 billion (USD1.39 billion); under the terms set out by the updated bid, Bouygues Telecom is tabling a bid of EUR11.3 billion in cash (an increase of EUR800 million), as well as a 43% interest in the enlarged, newly established entity. The new offer values Bouygues’ larger rival SFR at EUR15.5 billion (pre-synergies) and at nearly EUR20 billion after taking in all synergies. Further, Bouygues pledges to facilitate an initial public offering (IPO) as soon as the merger is completed, giving an immediate opportunity for Vivendi to monetise its interest.

As previously reported by TeleGeography’s CommsUpdate, last week Vivendi received two bids for France’s second largest mobile provider in terms of subscribers, from domestic broadband operator Numericable, majority owned by Luxembourg-based investment fund Altice Group, and Bouygues; both suitors initially valued SFR at around EUR19 billion–EUR20 billion. Earlier this week, Vivendi asked all interested parties to submit their final offers before its board of directors meeting, scheduled for 14 March 2014; however, Patrick Drahi, CEO of Altice Group, reportedly said that he will not raise his bid for SFR. Numericable and its parent offered a bid which consists of EUR11 billion in cash (comprising EUR8 billion in debt and EUR3 million via a capital increase) and 32% of the newly merged entity.##2329|Empty##2330|Beijing: Amid growing tensions with its neighbours over territorial disputes, Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said China has an unshakable will to safeguard its sovereignty but at the same time would enhance common interests and narrow differences with neighbouring countries.

"China has unwavering commitment to pursuing peaceful development and unshakable will in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, both for the sake of upholding stability and creating a favourable environment for its development," Li said addressing a press conference at the end of the annual parliamentary session ended.

"When neighbours interact with each other, it is only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of some kind or another," Li said.

"As long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefits, there will be harmonious sound instead of jarring noises," he said responding to a question on his visits to several neighbouring countries after he took power last year.

Li visited India first to show the importance Chinese leadership attached to bilateral relations followed by Pakistan and other countries.

His visit was reciprocated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh making 2013 a rare year when premiers of both countries visited each other in the same year.

During his annual press meet today, Li recalled his visit to Vietnam while references to India were conspicuously absent in his response to the question on China's relations with neighbours.

China at present is involved in maritime disputes with several of its neighbours in the South China Sea and with Japan over the disputed islands in the East China Sea, besides the long standing border dispute with India.

Li said peace and friendship and peaceful coexistence represent common aspirations of all people in China and its neighbouring countries, he said.

As a developing country, China needs a favourable neighbouring and international environment for its modernisation drive, he said.

As long as China and its neighbours together improve common interests and narrow differences, they will bring greater benefits to their people, Li said.

In a joint press release issued Tuesday, Men's Wearhouse said it will acquire Jos. A. Bank for for $65.00 per share in cash, or approximately $1.8 billion. Both company's boards of directors reportedly approved the agreement unanimously.

Once combined, the two retailers will have more than 1,700 U.S. stores, with around 23,000 employees and anticipated sales of $3.5 billion.

"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Jos. A. Bank, which we believe will deliver substantial benefits to our respective shareholders, employees and customers," Doug Ewert, Men's Wearhouse president and CEO, said in the statement.

"Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth,” he continued, “and Jos. A. Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach. We expect the transaction will be accretive to Men's Wearhouse's earnings in the first full year.”

The merger should bring to a close months of headline-grabbing maneuvering and sniping between the two companies.

The soap opera began last June, when Men's Wearhouse abruptly fired its founder, CEO and chief spokesman George Zimmer – for allegedly not working with the company's new management and demanding veto power on key corporate decisions.

Jos. A Bank then offered to buy up its larger rival in an unsolicited bid in September, reportedly worth $2.4 billion. When the offer was turned down, the company called the Men's Wearhouse reponse “inexplicable,” and a “formulaic, knee-jerk rejection.”

Several weeks later, Men's Wearhouse returned the favor, making a retaliatory and ultimately unsuccessful, $1.6 billion bid on Jos. A Bank.

But now, with the merger battle finally over, "It's a second Christmas for Jos. A. Bank shareholders," Jerry Reisman, an M&A expert at law firm Reisman Peirez Reisman and Capobianco LLP, told Reuters.

The wire service also says Jos. A. Bank is ending its recently-announced plan to purchase outdoor retailer Eddie Bauer, in a cash and stock deal valued at $825 million.##2335|Empty##2336|Empty##2337|Empty##2338|Talk to a domain expert: 1-303-893-0552

The revelation leaves only two options — either one of the pilots (or both) were in charge of hijacking the plane, or they were forced to play along by someone else.

In one of the strangest revelations in the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370’s disappearance, new information shows that one of the pilots, either Zaharie Ahmad Shah or Fariq Abdul Hamid, said “Alright, goodnight” to Malaysian air traffic controls after communication devices were disabled — but the pilot did not indicate that there was anything wrong with flight. So what does this mean?

Malaysia Flight: Pilot Had To Have Been Part Of Hijacking

It had already been determined that Flight 370’s signaling system had been disabled manually, but on March 15 Malaysia’s defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, confirmed that the system, which reports date about the plane’s equipment, had been turned off before the pilots’ last known contact with air traffic controllers, according to the New York Times.

[hl_ndn videoid=”25720591″]

This revelation has raised even more suspicion that one or both of the pilots were involved in hijacking the plane, because in any normal circumstance, a pilot would presumably relay that his aircraft’s systems were down — or on a more extreme level, that the plane was being hijacked. But the fact that there was a content verbal signoff after systems had already turned off suggests that whoever gave the signoff was trying to mislead air traffic control.

[hl_ndn videoid=”25720391″]

It’s become more and more apparent that whoever was in control of Flight 370 wanted it to disappear. And the complexity of the operation — turning off the plane’s communication devices, diverting course, giving a signoff — is so high, that experts and U.S. officials believe the pilots — or just one of them — had to be involved.

The other possibility, however, is that the pilots were compelled to carry out this complex plan by someone who had taken over the plane.

Zaharie Ahmad Shah: Did He Hijack Flight 370?

As of now, the pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah seems to be the most likely suspect. After investigators began looking more intently at the two pilots on March 14, it was reportedly discovered that Zaharie is a fanatical, political activist who opposes the Malaysian government, according to Mail Online.

Zaharie allegedly attended the trial of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim just hours before Flight 370 was set to take off. Anwar was sentenced to five years in prison in a court decision that has since been called unjust by many. In light of this new information, many fear that Zaharie may have hijacked Flight 370 as a form of political protest.

Additionally, Zaharie’s wife and three children reportedly moved out of the family home just one day before the flight’s takeoff, leading many to suggest that this tragedy may have been Zaharie’s catatonic reaction to the turmoil in his personal life.

These are all questions that do not have answers yet, though — just theories. So stay tuned for further developments.

And, with more people covered, doctors and hospitals are expecting an uptick in treating one of our state's biggest health challenges: obesity.

Listen to the full interview above.##2346|King Digital Entertainment PLC, best known for Candy Crush Saga, has released more details about its upcoming IPO, setting a price range of $21 – $24 on 22 million shares (underwriters will have the option to buy an additional 3 million shares). King estimates that it earn $326 million from the IPO (using $22.5 for its estimate), and with 315 million shares outstanding the $24 maximum price would set the company’s valuation at $7.6 billion.

Unlike many companies in the mobile space, King Digital is at least profitable. The company has had positive operating cash flow for the last nine years, revenues have grown from $22 million to $602 million from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2013, and the company has gone from a $1 million loss to $159 million in profits over the same period. King Digital has 324 million monthly active users, 144 million daily active users, and 12 million unique monthly payers on average.

King Digital faces same risks as Zynga did in 2011

Investors looking at King Digital will be quickly reminded of Zynga Inc (NASDAQ:ZNGA). Both companies have leaned on the revenues from one major hit with a few smaller titles bringing in decent revenue, and a huge portfolio of games that never connected with players. Zynga has Farmville, Farmville 2, and Zynga Poker; King Digital has Candy Crush Saga (78% of gross bookings), Farm Heroes Saga, and Pet Rescue (all three make up 95% of gross bookings).

King Digital’s development model is to first launch a new game online to its ‘VIPs’ in a tournament format to see which is the most popular and then continue developing that title until it is ready to become one of its ‘Saga’ titles. The inclusion of a devoted player base makes sense, but it’s still no guarantee that King Digital will make another hit.

King already showing signs of weakness

Also, it’s hard not to notice that revenues, gross bookings, and profits were all down last quarter. If people are getting tired of Candy Crush Saga and nothing comes to takes its place, King Digital investors watch the stock price steadily decline as the new game of the week pulls people away from the games they’ve already gotten tired of. Despite a recent bout of bullishness, that’s exactly what happened with Zynga Inc (NASDAQ:ZNGA). It is possible for gaming companies to reliably produce hits (Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) is responsible for Diablo, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Hearthstone among others), but judging King Digital on a single mega hit is risky.##2347|Image copyright AFP Image caption Alibaba is China's largest online shopping portal

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has announced plans for a flotation in the US, saying the move will make it "a more global company".

The move had been widely predicted by analysts, who expect it to be the biggest share offering by a tech firm since Facebook's flotation in 2012.

They predict that the listing will raise up to $15bn (£9bn).

However, Alibaba did not reveal when the initial public offering (IPO) would take place or on which exchange.

"Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States," the firm's statement said.

"This will make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals."

The move is expected to benefit Yahoo, which owns a significant stake in Alibaba and could see the value of its investment rise considerably.

Move overseas

Speculation about a New York listing for Alibaba began last September, when the company abandoned plans for a stock offering in Hong Kong after talks with regulators broke down.

Alibaba's management structure, which allows senior executives to retain control of the board of directors, fell foul of Hong Kong's listing rules.

Hong Kong Stock Exchange chief executive Charles Li said in a statement: "We respect the company's decision and wish it well."

He added, in an apparent reference to Alibaba's insistence on maintaining its management structure: "We are proud of our tradition of respect for the rule of law and adherence to principles."

The Alibaba group is already the world's largest online retailer, with more than 500 million customers and more than 800 million product listings.

However, it is so far little known outside China.

The news comes two days after another Chinese tech giant, Twitter-like service Weibo, announced plans for a $500m US listing.##2348|In this June 2010 photo, workers at General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, put the final touches on Chevy Cobalts. (Mark Duncan/AP)

General Motors is the target of multiple federal inquiries launched to determine why the nation’s largest automaker took more than a decade to address a mechanical problem that the company admits played a role in 13 deaths.

Lawmakers in both the House and Senate have announced plans to summon GM officials to Capitol Hill for hearings, and a potential criminal investigation is underway at the Justice Department.

The U.S. attorney in New York has launched a preliminary inquiry to determine whether GM knowingly rolled out cars with a faulty ignition switch that stalled their engines and disabled their air bags, according to a person briefed on the inquiry. GM could be found criminally liable if the company knew about the problem, did not fix it and failed to notify federal regulators.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — which is facing scrutiny for what consumer advocates call an inadequate response to the problem — is also grilling GM about the chain of events that led to the recall of 1.6 million cars last month. The agency said Wednesday that it has been in communication with the Justice Department as it has pursued its probe.

Meanwhile, consumer groups Wednesday demanded that GM set aside $1 billion to compensate victims of the defect. As a result of its 2009 bankruptcy, GM is not civilly liable for deaths and injuries linked to the faulty ignition switch.

View Graphic A history of GM’s ignition problems

“By concealing the ignition key defect for at least 10 years, GM created more victims and then robbed them of their legal rights through the passage of time,” Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, and Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator and president emeritus of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said in a letter to Mary T. Barra, who became GM’s chief executive in January.

House investigators have demanded that GM brief them by next week. And Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) announced plans Wednesday to convene a hearing of her consumer-protection subcommittee in April.

“We have to get to the bottom of this,” McCaskill said in a statement. “We need to find out who dropped the ball and put millions of Americans at risk. We also need to make sure that General Motors and federal regulators are doing everything they can to prevent more tragedies like this now and in the future.”

The confluence of investigations is battering GM, which has been enjoying a strong resurgence in car sales after its 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout. Now the company finds itself at risk of criminal penalties, new federal legislation and tens of millions of dollars in fines from federal regulators. Perhaps more important, the company could see its improved reputation tarnished in the marketplace.

GM shares have fallen more than 7 percent this week, closing Wednesday at $34.86.

“The company must come to a quick and satisfying resolution of the issue to assure that it won’t be tainted by sins of the past,” said Jack R. Nerad, a senior market analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “The fact that GM was rescued by the American taxpayers makes a resolution that is satisfactory to the average person on the street even more imperative than if such an issue arose in another company. “

The company has apologized and acknowledged that its recall process was not adequate. Barra has launched what she said would be a no-holds-barred internal review under the direction of a former federal prosecutor. The company has also promised to open its books to investigators.

“We are fully cooperating with NHTSA and will do so with the Congress, too. We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts,” the company said in a statement.

In an updated chronology for federal safety regulators released late Wednesday, GM said it discovered problems with its ignition switches in 2001 when it was developing the Saturn Ion. But the company determined that a design change had addressed the flaws before the car went on sale.

In 2005, according to a timeline released Tuesday, GM learned that a Chevrolet Cobalt had lost engine power because the key moved out of the “run” position when the driver inadvertently jostled the key or the steering column. GM investigators were able to replicate the problem during test drives.

The company weighed several fixes, but ultimately did nothing. When similar problems cropped up in other cars, the company issued a service bulletin in 2005 alerting dealers to the possibility that drivers could “inadvertently turn off the ignition.”

At the same time, NHTSA launched an inquiry after a fatal car crash claimed the life of 16-year-old Amber Marie Rose in Southern Maryland. Investigators found that her car’s ignition switch was in the “accessory” position, preventing her air bag from deploying — a defect that probably cost her life, according to an investigator hired by Rose’s family.

After another fatal crash, in 2006, NHTSA determined that that car, too, had been turned off. But the agency said it never amassed enough firm information to order a recall.

That changed last year when GM — under pressure from an increasing number of lawsuits — hired an outside engineering firm, which pinpointed the ignition problem.

In February, GM announced its decision to recall the cars; the company said notices were mailed to owners this week. The company said dealers would offer free loaner cars to affected drivers as well as $500 discounts on new GM vehicles.##2349|LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - The early signs from the Bank of England’s response to allegations of manipulation in currency markets are “not encouraging”, the chairman of an influential committee of British lawmakers said.

Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury Committee that earlier on Tuesday heard evidence from BoE Governor Mark Carney and other senior officials, said the Bank had “taken some time” to take the lead on accusations of misconduct in forex markets.

“This is the first real test for the Bank of England’s new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging,” he said in a statement.

Carney faced more than four-and-a-half hours of questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, a large part of which was devoted to the Bank’s response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.##2350|CLOSE

Vegas shooting memorial: 'None of us will ever be the same'##2351|How advantageous that national security and stability depends on abundant energy. In that respect the U.S. is certainly blessed. Our land has sufficient natural gas, oil, and wind to make most other nations envious.

The people in the Ukraine and East Europe understand firsthand how a lack of industry and natural resources can put them at the mercy of thugs like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Just a few years ago it would be difficult to think of natural gas as an energy weapon and influence. But he has made it so.

Now instead of flexing U.S. military muscle, it’s possible to flex industrial muscle by providing a reliable source of fuel and the tools for Europeans to produce their own. And because this is a windpower magazine, it makes perfect sense to advocate the use of wind power to supplement the use of natural gas. The two are natural allies. One would assume Europeans would heat their homes and power their factories with the gas, while wind power would augment electricity production when it’s available.

For those who would scoff at the ideas of wind turbines supplementing natural gas, let me remind you that in the U.K., the only country where the fuel seems in sufficient supply, people pay about $10/million Btus. In this country, a recent price for it was less than $5/million Btus. So consider what a modest wind farm of 100 MW, working with a 35% capacity factor would produce:

P = 100 MW x 0.35 x 24hr/d x 365 d/yr

= 319,375 MWh/yr

An online converter says that 1 MWh = 3.412 MBtus

So, at $10/MBtus, this small wind farm produces an equivalent of:

P g = 319,375 MWh/yr x 3.412 MBtus/MWh x $10 MBtu

= $10,897,075.

In the energy world, this is a small figure, but because there is no charge for the fuel that drives wind turbines, they provide price stability and a useful product, qualities sorely lacking in the Ukraine.

You might argue that selling natural gas to Europe means there is less to use here. Correct to a point. But this is what allies do: they help each other. Especially those with a well-established and growing wind industry, which means to offset the relatively small amount of gas sold to Europe, build more wind farms here.

Of course, when natural gas is scarce, its price will rise above the $10 figure and the wisdom of wind power will become more obvious, even to those who scoff. The message is clear: economic stability comes in part through low energy prices …and wind power.

The transaction will create a combined company valued at $US1.07 billion ($A1.19 billion) named ChiquitaFyffes, a fresh produce company with annual revenue of $US4.6 billion, the companies said in a joint statement.

The all-stock deal values the Irish company at $US526 million. The combined company will become the leading global banana and other fresh produce company, with sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas a year, they said.

The deal puts together two storied banana companies that began in the 19th century as modest suppliers and grew into global powerhouses.

Chiquita was founded by Captain Lorenzo Dow Baker, who in 1870 bought bunches of bananas in Jamaica and sold them for a profit in New Jersey.

Fyffes, founded in 1888 as EW Fyffe, Son and Co, launched the first fruit brand in the world in 1929 with its “Fyffes Blue Label” sticker on bananas.

“This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies,” said Ed Lonergan, Chiquita's chief executive.

Chiquita is a leading global marketer and distributor of fresh food products, including bananas and packaged salads. Fyffes is one of Europe's largest tropical produce distributors, mainly bananas, pineapples and melons.

Chiquita shareholders will own approximately 50.7 per cent of the new company, with Fyffes shareholders owning the rest. The value of the transaction was based on the companies' closing share prices on Friday and an exchange rate of one euro to $US1.39. ChiquitaFyffes will have an operating presence in more than 70 countries and a workforce of some 32,000 people.

Lonergan will serve as chairman of ChiquitaFyffes and David McCann, Fyffes executive chairman, will be chief executive.

“We are looking forward to working with the Chiquita team to build a combined company which is well positioned to succeed in our highly competitive marketplace and which will create significant value for our shareholders,” McCann said.

The merger is subject to shareholder and regulator approvals. The companies expect it to close by the end of the year.

Chiquita and Fyffes predicted the tie-up of their complementary business would produce operational efficiencies and pre-tax cost savings of at least $US40 million a year by the end of 2016. The combined company will have more than 24,000 hectares of owned or leased operations in Central America.

They pledged to continue their commitment to sustainability and pro-environment concerns.

“ChiquitaFyffes will continue its environmental and social responsibility commitments, including adding additional organic, Fairtrade, GlobalGAP and Rainforest Alliance certified capacity,” they said.

The merged company will maintain the brands of each company. Generations of Americans know Chiquita brand bananas, brought to life in 1944 by the glamorous Miss Chiquita animated banana and portrayed live by models and personalities.

Fyffes has extended its groundbreaking oval Blue Label banana brand to Blue Label Pineapples and winter season melons.

The combined company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and based in Ireland.

Chiquita, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, posted a loss of $US16 million for 2013, a sharp improvement after losing $US405 million in 2012.

On Monday, Fyffes announced preliminary results for 2013 showing a profit of $US26.1 million euros ($A28.96 million), up almost 10 per cent from the prior year.

Chiquita shares jumped 12.1 per cent to $US12.15 in late-morning trade in New York. Fyffes soared 42 per cent to 106.50 pence in London.##2357|Ben Watkins

WASHINGTON — The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday launched an effort to encourage issuers and underwriters of municipal securities to self-report certain violations of the federal securities laws rather than wait for their violations to be detected.

Under the Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation Initiative, the SEC's Enforcement Division's Municipal Securities and Public Pension unit will recommend favorable settlement terms for muni issuers and underwriters who voluntarily report that there were inaccurate statements in bond documents about their prior compliance with continuing disclosure obligations. Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires underwriters to reasonably determine that an issuer will comply with its continuing disclosure agreement before underwriting any new municipal securities. The rule also requires new offering documents to include descriptions of any continuing disclosure violations in the past five years.

"The Enforcement Division is committed to using innovative methods to uncover securities law violations and improve transparency in the municipal markets," said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the Enforcement Division. "We encourage eligible parties to take advantage of the favorable terms we are offering under this initiative. Those who do not self-report and instead decide to take their chances can expect to face increased sanctions for violations."

The SEC has repeatedly indicated it is paying stricter attention to whether issuers are living up to their disclosure agreements and whether underwriters are doing their due diligence in making sure of that. Last year an SEC probe examined underwriters in California, and a July 2013 enforcement action targeted both West Clark Community Schools in Clark County, Ind. and Indianapolis-based City Securities Corp. with falsely claiming in bond documents that the issuer was meeting its secondary market disclosure obligations when it was not.

"Continuing disclosures are a critical source of information for investors in municipal securities, and offering documents should accurately disclose issuers' prior compliance with their disclosure obligations," said LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, chief of the Enforcement Division's Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. "This initiative is designed to promote improved compliance by encouraging responsible behavior by market participants who have failed to meet their obligations in the past."

Bond Dealers of America president and chief executive officer Mike Nicholas said the SEC goal is sound but the details of the new program will have to be carefully examined.

"The BDA supports the SEC's goal toward self-reporting of violations to the extent an obvious violation of the securities law has occurred," Nicholas said. "We caution that there may be disproportionate administrative, reporting and other burdens on underwriters via the settlement obligation requirements and we will be examining those in more detail in the coming days."

Ben Watkins, Florida's bond finance director and the chair of the Government Finance Officers Association's debt management committee, said the new program isn't likely to provide much incentive for issuers to step forward.

"I don't see it," Watkins said, adding that issuers would probably end up with a cease-and-desist order whether they self-report or get caught by SEC investigators.

John McNally, a lawyer at Hawkins, Delafield & Wood LLP, said the SEC's announcement underscores a point the commission has already made. McNally said that the investigations currently being done by underwriters of an issuer's filing history are very comprehensive, and pointed out that the SEC issued a release in June 2010 warning underwriters that they should be diligent about looking into an issuer's filing history. The West Clark case made issuers sit up and take notice as well, McNally said.

"The SEC has already advised issuers and underwriters of their concerns, and all parties are paying careful attention to such advice," he said.##2358|Colorado collected $3.5 million in tax revenue from marijuana sales in January, according to the state Department of Revenue, a figure that includes both recreational and medical sales.

Recreational sales accounted for $1.4 million collected from a special 10 percent point-of purchase tax and $195,000 in a 15 percent excise tax. The first $40 million raised from the excise tax is required to be spent on school construction and maintenance, but how the sales tax revenue will be spent is still up for debate.

Gov. John Hickenlooper proposed a marijuana revenue-spending package last month that’s heavy on drug education and rehabilitation efforts. Colorado’s police chiefs are lobbying for a larger percentage of the windfall for “marijuana enforcement,” a request that many advocates of legal marijuana have questioned, considering pot is legal for adults.

The official tally of tax revenue is less than what was projected by Hickenlooper’s office, if the pace were to remain the same throughout the year.

But the revenue department said it would be difficult to project annual returns without more data — January’s collection came from 59 businesses around the state, a fraction of the number expected to be operational by year’s end. The number of businesses approved to sell legal pot by the end of January was only 3 percent of the state’s medical marijuana dispensaries, the only businesses currently eligible to convert to retail sales.

“Tax and fee revenue collections in the first few months of 2014 will be significantly affected in both directions by a number of variables,” the department noted in a news release, “including but not limited to: the speed of local approval processes; the availability of supply; and a possible increase in initial demand.”

“The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations,” Department of Revenue Executive Director Barbara Brohl said in the release. “We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts.”

Advocates for legalizing marijuana hailed the figures as those pushing for federal changes to marijuana laws plan to lobby Congress in Washington, D.C. on Thursday.

“The month of January showed the world that taking marijuana off the streets and putting it behind a taxed, regulated counter can be done professionally, productively and prosperously,” said Aaron Smith, the director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, in a statement. “Now it’s time for Congress to reconcile outdated federal laws with those of states like Colorado that have decided to opt out of the failed experiment of marijuana prohibition.”

Organizers will be joined by a bipartisan trio of lawmakers who have taken the lead in calling for reform of federal marijuana laws, under which, possession, consumption, sales and cultivation remain illegal. They include Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California and Democrats Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado.

It is a company that recruits people to hawk its products, not available in stores, to their friends and neighbors. Some critics have complained that its vitamins and other supplements, which are unregulated, are worthless, and that its sales force is exploited.

These “distributors” are recruited primarily in low-income minority neighborhoods. They are required to pay $1,500 or more to buy the products before they can start selling. Profit is far from assured.

Jackson was asked to join the fight against the practice. He did so, eagerly.

Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here

But Jackson didn’t understand the full dimension of the campaign until a bit later, when he got a call from the New York Times. A reporter was working on a story about how wealthy hedge fund manager William A. Ackman is betting big money that Herbalife would collapse.

According to the story, which appeared Monday, Ackman stands to gain a fortune if the company goes down. The lobbyist who approached Jackson works, he said, for Rasky Baerlein Strategic Communications, one of several firms hired to work in the nationwide anti-Herbalife campaign.

“I didn’t speak to any billionaires,” Jackson said Tuesday. “I had no idea what was going on in that space. My concern is for the people who have invested $2,000 that they’re never going to get back.”

Almost overnight, the anti-Herbalife campaign became the rare Wall Street war that reverberates in areas like Roxbury and Chelsea. With varying degrees of awareness, activists discovered that their campaign against what they viewed as a neighborhood-level ripoff placed them in league with a Wall Street tycoon whose company could reap millions from their activism.

The Herbalife business model has a reputation for leaving many of the distributors poorer than when they started.

“They never, ever earn back their initial investment,” said Gladys Vega, of the Chelsea Collaborative, a nonprofit battling the company. “What bothers me about this whole thing is that these companies focus onto low-income communities — communities of undocumented immigrants, people who are vulnerable, and who become victims of financial fraud."

Fighting Herbalife is a natural crusade for a neighborhood activist like Vega, who can reel off the predatory scandals she has seen in recent years in Chelsea.

Hedge fund manager Ackman maintains that he, too, is fighting Herbalife on principle, because it does harm, not because he stands to make big money if his bet against Herbalife pays off. If he wins, he says, he will give his gains to charity.

Some activists felt odd about that fact that they end up being allied with Ackman’s anti-Herbalife campaign. After all, a hedge fund is the kind of outfit they would normally view with deep suspicion.

“Its unfortunate that [Ackman] is involved in this stuff,” said Horace Small of the Union of Minority Neighborhoods. “But the truth is that Herbalife, Amway, all these . . . folks are hurting people. They prey on poor people.”

Whether Ackman’s company can take down Herbalife, we’ll see. The vitamin company has vowed to fight the effort to destroy its image, and maintains its products and practices are legitimate, not some sort of pyramid scheme, as critics allege.

But a growing number of activists and politicians seem convinced that the company is a bum deal for the people they care about. Whether red flags were raised by corporate lobbyists or families that lost investments, a highly unusual coalition seems to be taking root.

“If we continue to ignore the warning signs in our community, it leaves the door open for everyone to do scams, and for people to lose the money they worked so hard to gain,” said Vega of the Chelsea Collaborative. “If we are wrong, prove us wrong. If we’re right, get them out of the state.”

Last August, Carney said interest rates would not rise until unemployment fell below 7 per cent. After unemployment fell rapidly he adjusted the threshold in February to a range of 18 economic indicators.

At a Treasury select committee hearing this morning, MPs argued forward guidance was “dead and buried”.

Carney told MPs the change had only been made to boost transparency of forecasting and was not related to the drop in unemployment. He said the new measures were entirely down to greater transparency and more accurate economic forecasting.

Conservative MP Brooks Newmark said the changes showed forward guidance had been traded in for “fuzzy guidance”.

Carney said: “We provided guidance that was well understood. Businesses indicated it gave them greater confidence in the recovery and influenced hiring and spending decisions, contributing to falling unemployment.

“These 18 indicators are not part of the new forward guidance. They are the fulfilment of a commitment the Bank made to implement recommendations to improve transparency and forecasting. We have provided more detail about our forecasts and it allows greater perspective.”

Carney said the path of interest rates was clear over three years and could hit 3 per cent within three years.

He said: “Interest rates will rise on a gradual and limited extent. Some Monetary Policy Committee members have put more precise figures on when interest rates will rise over the three-year horizon. Charlie Bean said [an increase of] 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent and I don’t think that is an unreasonable sense to get across.”

Carney admitted he had no control over parts of the London housing market which were fuelled by cash buyers, claiming he could only prevent bubbles where markets were driven by mortgages.

TSC chair Andrew Tyrie also hit out at the MPC for destroying recordings of its meetings. Tyrie asked Carney to review the policy, saying the records are of “huge historical importance”.

But deputy Bank governor Paul Fisher argued retaining MPC minutes could make discussions less frank and more inhibited.##2361|The grass is greener in Colorado. According to figures released Monday by the Department of Revenue, the state collected more than $3.5 million in taxes and fees from marijuana sales in January, when it was legalized. More than $2 million came from recreational pot, the rest from medicinal marijuana. Fifty-nine businesses filed a tax return for recreational pot in January, but by mid-February Colorado had 163 retail stores. Voters had approved a 15 percent excise tax on producers and a 10 percent special sales tax on consumers. Gov. John Hickenlooper predicted that total pot sales would reach $610 million next fiscal year, and that revenue from taxes and fees would reach $98 million—above earlier estimates of $70 million.##2362|Eberhard Kern, Managing Director & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India said “The S-Class has always set newer standards that have retained its accolade as “the best automobile in the world” with each generation.

Alibaba said in a statement on Sunday it had decided to begin the U.S. IPO process, ending months of speculation about where it would go public.

Separately, sources told Reuters that Alibaba is in discussions with Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley for lead underwriting roles.

Most of the six banks are to set to win the coveted role of joint global coordinator, added the sources, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Analysts estimate the Hangzhou, China-based company has a value of at least $140 billion, and the IPO proceeds could exceed $15 billion, Reuters previously reported. The deal would be a huge coup for the six banks, as it would yield an estimated $260 million in underwriting fees, assuming 1.75 percent commission, and catapult them in league table rankings.

Alibaba declined to comment on the banks working on the deal. The banks mentioned in the report either declined comment or did not respond to Reuters’ requests for a comment.

“This will be a huge deal, bigger than what people were anticipating,” one person familiar with the process said, adding that the IPO was expected to be kicked off “very soon”.

Reuters reported on Saturday that Alibaba is planning a U.S. IPO in the third quarter, with a filing of documents expected as early as April.

BILLIONAIRE MA

Alibaba, whose platforms handle more goods than EBay Inc and Amazon.com Inc combined, was founded in 1999 by former English teacher Jack Ma and 17 other people. It has grown from a startup in Ma’s apartment to a behemoth with offices around the world and more than 20,000 employees.

The listing will be closely watched by Alibaba’s two largest shareholders - Yahoo Inc, which owns 24 percent, and Japan’s Softbank Corp, which controls 37 percent. Alibaba’s founders and some senior managers jointly own about 13 percent of the company.

Yahoo has said it plans to trim its stake in Alibaba through the IPO. It initially invested in Alibaba in 2005.

Alibaba’s decision to go to the United States is a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially the company’s preferred venue for the IPO.

Alibaba also said in a statement on its corporate news Web site it might consider extending its public status to Chinese capital markets in future in order for investors there to be able to share in its growth.

Alibaba, which controls about 80 percent of the country’s e-commerce, had been in discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission since last year about a listing, but the island city’s regulators blocked its proposal as it violated the “one-share-one-vote principle”.

Alibaba’s executive vice chairman Joe Tsai upped the rhetoric against Hong Kong when he told Reuters last week that the firm would not change its partnership structure in order to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

After an initial rebuff, Alibaba and the Hong Kong regulators were back at the negotiating table late last year, to find a solution to the problem. While the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd has initiated a review of its listing rules to accommodate more flexible structures, any change to the existing rules would take months.

“We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group,” Alibaba said in its statement.

“We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.”

Gox, a leading bitcoin exchange that late last month filed for bankruptcy protection, updated its website on Tuesday to allow customers to log in and verify their virtual wallet, or account balance.

The website, which went blank just over three weeks ago, had previously posted occasional updates on Mt. Gox's civil rehabilitation process - a legal procedure that may allow Mt. Gox to rebuild and pay back some of its creditors - as well as a warning that some spam or phishing emails purporting to be from the exchange were in circulation.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on February 28, saying it may have lost 850,000 bitcoins - worth around $520 million at current prices - to hackers. It has since gone through a similar process in the United States.

A spokesperson reached via a helpline for Mt. Gox creditors confirmed that Mt. Gox set up the log-in, based on the last available data from the exchange's servers before they shut down.

Leaked information from various hacking attacks on Mt. Gox servers and CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog and Reddit account have been released in recent weeks, and one file purporting to be the company's internal database contained malware that could steal bitcoins once downloaded.

Besides the log-in option, the Mt. Gox homepage carried a statement in English and Japanese saying: "Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by Mt. Gox of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users."

BoE Governor Mark Carney is due to give a speech at 1805 GMT on Tuesday announcing wide-ranging changes to the Bank’s organization, including details of a separate new post of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking.

“The Treasury is likely to announce the new deputy governor for monetary policy before Mr. Carney’s speech,” the source said.

The ministry has advertised for a successor to Bean, who retires on June 30.

The BoE’s chief economist, Spencer Dale, has long been the favorite to succeed Bean, according to bookmakers Paddy Power.

But late on Monday Lucrezia Reichlin - a professor at London Business School who formerly headed the European Central Bank’s research department - overtook Dale, with her odds shortening markedly to 11/8 - a probability of eight in 19 - from 6/1 earlier in the day. Dale’s odds lengthened to 15/8.

Recent senior appointments at the BoE, including that of Carney himself, have not gone to BoE insiders, and Carney is also keen to have more women in senior positions at the BoE. There are currently none on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee that sets interest rates.

The Bank of England declined to comment on when the appointment would be announced or on possible candidates.##2369|It's going to be a busy first meeting Janet Yellen in her new position as head of the Federal Reserve's policy committee.

Among the first items of business this week could be whether the U.S. central bank needs to respond in any way to developments in Ukraine.

A Sunday referendum in Crimea could induce anxiety in global financial markets. U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to use his influence to stop the referendum.

Western powers will be left with little choice but to follow through on their threats of trade and financial sanctions. The uncertainty could threaten financial stability, and prompt the Fed to act. Whether that will be necessary will become clearer when officials gather for their two-day meeting in Washington on Tuesday.

At any other time, the Fed's regular business would be the primary focus of traders and investors. Ms. Yellen, who took over as chair a few days after Ben Bernanke ran his last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the end of January, quite likely will set the U.S. central bank on a new path.

The basics of the Fed's policy won't change.

Policy makers will leave the benchmark rate at zero, they most likely will shave their asset-purchase program – also known as quantitative easing, or QE – by another $10-billion (U.S.), dropping the total monthly buying to $55-billion. Indicators suggest the economy is growing at about the pace that the Fed thought it would in January. There have been disappointments, but those probably were related mostly to exceptionally frigid and snow weather.

But that's the present. What will dominate discussion at the policy meeting will be the future – and more specifically, how to describe the way the Fed will react to it.

While QE gets most of the attention, the more innovative – and less-tested – of the Fed's responses to the financial crisis is its decision to state explicitly its policy intentions. In normal times, central bankers prefer a bit of mystery: It leaves them with options if the world doesn't unfold as their models predict.

But with the world in chaos, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues at the Fed decided they could inspire confidence by telling executives, households and investors exactly how long they intended to keep interest rates low. After some adjustment, the Fed settled on guidance that it would leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged at least until the unemployment rate dropped to 6.5 per cent.

Story continues below advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

That seemed like a safe target. According to Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist at HSBC, when the U.S. unemployment rate has been higher than 6.5 per cent, inflation always has been falling. Under that threshold, the historical inflation data are more variable. So for a central bank with an inflation target, 6.5 per cent was a good marker.

But the unemployment rate has fallen far faster than anyone at the central bank expected. The jobless rate was 6.7 per cent in February, even though economic growth can at best be described as modest.

In some of its more recent policy statements, the Fed has said it won't change course on policy until the unemployment rate falls "well past" 6.5 per cent. But few market participants seem convinced by this modification. Professional Fed watchers essentially are universal in their prediction that the Fed will replace its "quantitative" guidance with a more "qualitative" description of when it plans to raise interest rates.

This is a positive development. The explicit guidance was an extraordinary response to extraordinary times. A step away from that implies the U.S. economy is getting back to normal.

But it also means that the Fed is about to become a little trickier to read. The minutes of the January policy meeting show that policy makers were far from consensus on how to communicate to the public. Since the unemployment rate isn't sending a clear signal, it's possible the Fed will lay out the other indicators it will be watching to get a read on the economy. These could include rates of longer-term unemployment and wage inflation. The one thing that is clear is there will be a lot of room for interpretation.

"It's going to make QE look easy," Mr. Logan said.##2370|Beijing - China's industrial output rose 8.6 percent in January and February year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced Thursday, the worst result in nearly five years.

The figure, which measures production at factories, workshops and mines, was the lowest since 7.3 percent was recorded in April 2009, according to previous NBS data.

Retail sales, a key indicator of consumer spending in the world's second-largest economy, gaining 11.8 percent in the two months from the year before, the NBS said on its website.

That figure was also the lowest for several years.

Fixed asset investment, a measure of government spending on infrastructure, expanded 17.9 percent during the first two months of 2014, the NBS added.

The body released statistics covering a two month period due to China's Lunar New year holiday week, which fell in both months.

The figures come as China's leadership says it wants to transform the growth model away from an over-reliance on often wasteful investment, and instead make private demand the driver for the country's future development.

China announced earlier this month that is targeting economic growth of about 7.5 percent in 2014, the same as last year.

The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.7 percent in 2013, unchanged from the year before, which was the worst result since 1999. - Sapa-AFP##2371|Empty##2372|* EPL Oil to be acquired by Energy XXI for $2.3 bln

NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were poised to fall at the open, putting the S&P 500 on track for a third straight decline, as concerns grew over the strength of China’s economy.

* London copper, seen as a proxy for China’s economic health, fell for a fourth day to its lowest level since July 2010.

Stock Markets Mar 10, 2014 02:13AM ET

Investing.com - Shanghai and Hong Kong led Asian stocks markets lower on Monday, as weak trade data from China weighed on regional sentiment, while shares in Malaysia Airlines sank after one of its planes went missing over the weekend.



In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 1.6% while the Shanghai Composite in mainland China was 1.7% lower.



The Chinese currency and copper prices were also hit by the trade data. The yuan fell as low as 6.1594 to the dollar early in the session, compared with Friday's close of 6.1260 in New York, and was last trading at 6.1402 per dollar.



LME three-month copper prices fell to their lowest levels since June in Asia, and were last trading at $6,715.25 a metric ton, a 1% decline from Friday's closing price.



Along with weak manufacturing data so far this year, the trade figures became the latest poor economic number to come out of China. The resulting concerns over the economy have made Chinese stocks among the region's worst performers in 2014, with the Hang Seng Index down 4.3% year-to-date--second only to the Nikkei, which is 7% lower over the same period.



Elsewhere in Asia, the impact was felt most in Australia--a country with strong trade ties with China. In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.8%. Mining stocks were badly hit, with Rio Tinto losing 5% and BHP Billiton 3.5% lower.



Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi lost 0.9% and Japan's Nikkei was 0.8% lower after the country posted a fourth straight month of current-account deficit in January. The yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar and was last trading at ¥103.12 to the dollar, compared with ¥103.26 late Friday in New York.



Last week, in U.S. trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.19%, the S&P 500 index rose 0.05%, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.37%.



European indices, meanwhile, finished lower.



After the close of European trade, the EURO STOXX 50 fell 1.50%, France's CAC 40 fell 1.15%, while Germany's DAX 30 fell 2.01%. In the U.K. the FTSE 100 fell 1.12%.

Recommended##2374|Empty##2375|King, the future one-hit wonder responsible for the cellular telephone game Candy Crush Saga, announced today that it will pretend to be worth up to $7.6 billion before the studio inevitably collapses. As The New York Times’ Dealbook reports, King has filed a revised prospectus for an initial public offering of stock, and it intends to price its shares between $21 and $24. That means that a single share’s worth of King will cost the same as about 30 chocolate bombs in Candy Crush Saga, a game that nobody will be playing a couple years from now. The $7.6 billion self-valuation is an important public-relations step for the company, as it gives journalists a number they can reference when they eventually write stories about the studio’s sudden and calamitous decline.

King, which has made a single ultra-popular game in a decade of existence, is now solidly on track for its upcoming implosion, having entered the traditional pre-IPO make-believe monkeyshines period. After the studio stumbled onto a game that a lot of people like to play while waiting in line at the bank, King is asking investors to believe that it has discovered a formula for repeated, enduring success in the mobile game industry. The Candy Crush firm may be taking notes from its competitor Zynga, which is in the more advanced “collapse” stage of the game-studio collapse cycle after executing its hilarious “People will never get tired of FarmVille” strategy to perfection.

##2376|Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and Ranking Member Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, announced that they have reached an agreement on a housing finance reform proposal.

Last fall, the Senate Banking Committee hosted an in-depth series of hearings exploring essential elements necessary for reform.

Johnson and Crapo worked together to contain guarantee costs at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as agreements to help maintain solvency at the Federal Housing Administration.

Sponsor Content

For the past few months they have been negotiating and drafting the reform proposal and plan to introduce the legislation soon.

Here is the 10-point path Johnson and Crapo plan to completely reform housing in the United States.

1. Wind down and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

2. Promote a smooth and stable transition from the old system to the new system by providing specific benchmarks and timelines to guide Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation – this will be modeled on the FDIC.

3. Keep current conforming loan limits so that mortgage credit continues to be available in high-cost areas.

4. Keep the To-Be-Announced secondary market liquid and direct FMIC to "take into account" the impact of new products on the TBA market.

5. Mandate 10% private capital, up front, and create a mortgage insurance fund for the system to protect taxpayers against future bailouts. We've seen these kinds of deals already.

6. Add multifamily as an asset class to those same risk-sharing mechanisms mentioned in point 5.

7. Create a member-owned securitization platform that will issue a single, standardized FMIC-wrapped security.

8. Establish a mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders to ensure institutions of all sizes have direct access to the secondary market so community banks and credit unions are not at the mercy of their larger competitors when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are dissolved.

8a.The small lender mutual cooperative would provide a cash window for individual eligible loans, and small lenders could retain servicing rights.

9. Require strong underwriting standards that mirror the definition of “qualified mortgage”, and set down payment requirement at 5% (with a short phase-in) except for first-time homebuyers at 3.5%.

10. Eliminate affordable housing goals and establish transparent and accountable housing-related funds that would focus on ensuring there is sufficient decent housing available. The funds are NOT paid for with tax dollars, but through a small FMIC user fee (10 basis points) that only those who choose to use the system pay.

10a. Despite the elimination of affordable housing goals, the reformed housing market will still facilitate the broad availability of credit for eligible single-family and multifamily borrowers, monitor consumer and market access to credit, and provide market based incentives and transparency to serve underserved areas.

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past,” Crapo said. “Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable."##2377|Send to Email Address

Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: NUS), another multi-level marketing company, was halted about 10 minutes later. Trading in Nu Skin resumed after about 5 minutes , and the shares dropped from an intra-day high near $82 to $70.

Herbalife was trading 4.45% higher at around $68 when shares were halted and reopened down about 13% near $57.

In its press release the company said:

Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC.

Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years.

The company said it would have no further comment on the matter “unless and until there are material developments.”

U.S. Senator Edward Markey sent a letter to the FTC a few weeks ago seeking an investigation into Herbalife’s operations, and Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management held another roadshow yesterday detailing how he believes the company is operating illegally in China.

According to the largest fast food chain operator, the sales performance of its segments in the United States and APMEA dropped 1.4% and 2.6% respectively while its segment in Europe rose 0.6%.

McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is experiencing challenges trying to increase its sales performance, particularly in the United States. Last January, the sales performance of the company’s U.S. fell 3.3%. CEO Don Thompson previously stated that McDonald’s needs to improve its menu offerings as it became less relevant to some customers.

McDonald’s growth priorities

Today, Thompson reiterated that the growth priorities of McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) globally include optimizing menus, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening the accessibility to McDonald’s brands. According to him, these priorities are the foundation of the company’s customer-centric approach in building its business over the long-term.

“We are intent on improving our business performance by thoughtfully evolving our approach to ensure that we are delivering the most compelling value, service and convenience to each of the approximately 70 million customers who choose McDonald’s each day,” added Thompson.

Severe weather conditions

McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) explained that its U.S. sales was impacted by challenging industry dynamics and severe weather conditions last month. In APMEA, its sales were affected by weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as the shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.

On the other hand, the largest food chain operator said its positive sale performance in Europe was due to the continued strong sales in the United Kingdom and France, which offset the ongoing weakness in Germany. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its European segment is benefiting from its local menu options, expanded convenience through breakfast and extended hours.

Peter Bensen, chief financial officer at McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its relatively flat global comparable sales year-to-date will pressure margins in the first quarter. He emphasized that the company is “diligently strengthening” its performance, and he is confident that the management is taking the right actions to clearly align with customer’s needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitability.##2382|Why did this happen?

People talk at the vegetable market in Olhao in the southern Portuguese province of Algarve March 12, 2013. REUTERS/Jose Manuel Ribeiro

The year-on-year inflation rate in the 18 countries sharing the euro was 0.7 percent in February against 0.8 percent in January, the European Union’s statistics office Eurostat said.

The reading was the joint-lowest in four years and a touch below the initial February estimate of 0.8 percent. The annual inflation print last fell to 0.7 percent in October - a decline that persuaded the European Central Bank to cut its key interest rate to a record low of 0.25 percent the following month.

Inflation has not dropped below that level since November 2009, when it stood at 0.5 percent, Eurostat said.

The ECB, which targets inflation at close to but below 2 percent, considers the risk of euro zone deflation as “quite limited”, its president Mario Draghi said last Thursday. The bank left borrowing costs unchanged at its most recent meeting on March 6.

Draghi also said the bank has been preparing additional policy steps to guard against possible deflation, and that the longer inflation remained low, the higher was the probability of deflationary risks emerging.

LOW INFLATION ‘THE NEW NORMAL’?

But the ECB has already said it expects inflation to only pick up slowly, to 1.0 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2016, and a minimal dip to 0.7 percent last month seems unlikely to prompt a significant policy change.

“The downward revision to the February inflation figures is unlikely to be enough to trigger further near-term monetary easing,” said Martin van Vliet, senior economist at ING. “This will also require a deterioration of the activity and or a further significant strengthening of the euro.”

A strong euro has weighed on prices, and the currency fell in reaction to Monday’s data, dipping against the dollar and paring gains against the yen.

Month-on-month inflation was 0.3 percent in February, driven by a 0.5 percent rise in prices of services and a 0.4 percent increase in costs of non-energy industrial goods.

Prices of food, alcohol and tobacco fell 0.1 percent on the month, while highly volatile energy costs inched up 0.1 percent.

In February, there were four euro zone countries with negative annual inflation rates, Portugal and Slovakia both with -0.1 percent, Greece with -0.9 percent and Cyprus at -1.3 percent.

“Today’s CPI figures are a clear reminder that low inflation may have become the new normal for the euro zone - which certainly won’t make it easy for some countries to reduce their debt overhangs,” van Vliet said.

Draghi has rejected comparisons with Japan’s experience of deflation, which became so entrenched that companies and households held off on spending on expectations of lower prices, leading to two decades of economic stagnation.

Speaking last Thursday, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann also said the risk of widespread deflation in the euro zone was very limited, adding that policymakers should not overload monetary policy to haul the bloc out of crisis.##2389|* China trade data weak

* McDonald’s February same-restaurant sales fall

* Boeing finds cracks in wings of Dreamliners in production

* Futures down: Dow 28 pts, S&P 3 pts, Nasdaq 1 pts

By Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open slightly lower on Monday, on the heels of a record high for the S&P 500, following unexpectedly weak data in China which tempered enthusiasm over the strength of the global economy.

* China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

* The data put a damper on positive sentiment generated by Friday’s better-than-expected U.S. payrolls report, which sent the S&P 500 to a record high for a second consecutive session.

* Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 1.4 percent to $31.74 in premarket trade as concerns over China sent London copper to an eight-month low.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under federal conservatorship since 2008, when regulators agreed to inject capital into the companies to keep them afloat.

They received $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds, but they have returned to profitability and by the end of March they will have had paid $202.9 billion in dividends to the U.S. Treasury.

No one expected them to become profitable again so quickly, but when home prices surged in 2012, they were able to recover more money than expected on soured loans.

The profit projections come in an addendum to President Barack Obama's fiscal 2015 budget proposal. In a budget proposal last year, the administration estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would send the Treasury $51 billion through 2023.

Under a 2012 revamp of their bailout terms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac send a majority of their profits to the Treasury as dividends, and they are unable to repurchase the controlling share the government took when it bailed them out. Previously, they were required to pay only a 10 percent dividend on their bailout funds in profitable quarters.

Shareholders, including Perry Capital and Fairholme Capital Management, have sued the United States over the changes. They argue that since the companies are returning profits to taxpayers, the government's stake should shrink.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration want to wind down and replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.##2391|The developer behind the hit smartphone game Candy Crush Saga expects to be worth as much as $7.6 billion when it floats later this month.

Thanks to an intelligent lightweight-design concept boasting weight savings of up to 100 kilograms, excellent aerodynamics and new economical engines, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class establishes new efficiency benchmarks in its segment.

A host of new assistance systems offers safety of the highest standard, while a new optional air-sprung suspension provides for exemplary ride and driving comfort as well as nimble and agile handling. In terms of appearance the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class adopts a progressive approach with its clear yet emotional design and its high-class interior. Many other innovations and equipment features underscore the Saloon’s energising comfort and refined sportiness. In all, the high-class appeal of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class feels like an “upgrade to a higher class of vehicle”.

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class offers sensuous and clear design and a host of technical innovations as well as a comprehensive scope of standard equipment and exemplary emissions and fuel consumption figures. This all adds up to substantial added value and long-term savings on motor vehicle tax and at the filling station.

The Mercedes-Benz C-Class has grown to take account of people’s increasing average height. With an 80-millimetre increase in the wheelbase (2840 millimetres) compared with the previous model, the vehicle is 95 millimetres longer (4686 milli­metres) and 40 millimetres wider (1810 millimetres). The result is a more spacious interior. At 480 litres the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class also surpasses its predecessor in terms of boot capacity (in accordance with ISO 3832).

Sensuous clarity and purist forms

On a visual level, the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class represents a bold departure from its predecessor. Its striking, dynamic design exudes sensuous clarity and arouses emotions. Modern aesthetics were the source of inspiration for the new Saloon’s sensuous lines and surfaces, whose harmony and dynamism directly touch everyone. The designers have created minimalist, purist forms for the Mercedes-Benz C-Class which emphasise its intelligent technology and engineering. The clearly defined surfaces also deliberately display a degree of tension, lending them a modern and at the same time emotional character. Precise lines and sculptural surfaces create progressive light and shadow effects.

In the side view a long bonnet, a passenger compartment set well back and short overhangs define the Mercedes-Benz C-Class’s classic, well-balanced Mercedes-Benz Saloon proportions.

There is a choice of two different fronts: sporty with a central star or – reserved solely for the EXCLUSIVE line – the classic Saloon radiator grille with the Mercedes star on the bonnet. This grille can close the louvres completely to optimise the Cd value, and with its overall appearance superbly emphasises the status of the refined Saloon.

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class comes with H7 halogen headlamps as standard. In addition to the standard-fit headlamps, two energy-saving LED variants are available: a static system and a dynamic version with the “LED Intelligent Light System”. The characteristic night design lends the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class its very own distinctive look in the dark, too. The rear lamp and brake light in the tail lamps feature LED technology with all headlamp versions.

High-class interior with fine details

The Mercedes-Benz designers have styled the interior on a level which is rarely encountered even in higher vehicle categories. This applies to the carefully chosen high-class materials and their pleasant touch and feel as well as to the precision of the finely crafted details. But also equally to a new design idiom which perfectly combines sensuousness and clarity with dynamic sportiness, and thus contributes to the high-class appeal of the interior.

The driver and front passenger enjoy a great deal of space and luxury in an unobtrusive, modern style on board the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class. This gives rise to a feel-good atmosphere which is new to this category of vehicle – settling into your seat in the Mercedes-Benz C-Class is akin to the uplifting feeling of being upgraded from economy to business class on an airliner.

The interior design demonstrates a bold new approach by Mercedes-Benz. Here the designers combine in accomplished style the architecture of the Mercedes-Benz sports cars with a totally new centre console featuring sporty flowing lines. In vehicles with automatic transmission, a large one-piece centre console panel performs an elegant sweep from the centre air vents to the armrest. These seamless, clear-cut lines create a sense of open space and convey a thrillingly purist and modern feel.

On vehicles with manual transmission, the centre console is slightly steeper and features two separate trim elements in order to create ample space for ergonomic operation of the shift lever.

A centrally positioned free-standing central display is the main eye-catching feature across the centre console – with a screen diagonal of 17.78 centimetres (7 inches), or 21.33 centimetres (8.4 inches) if COMAND Online is specified.

Five round air vents lend the instrument panel a sporty touch. With their metallic cool-touch effect they create a tangible contrast to the warm look of the other materials – such as the wood in the centre console or the ARTICO man-made leather on the instrument panel. The “upgrade” feel duly continues with the controls. All switches have a high-quality, three-dimensional design befitting a luxury vehicle and benefit from a clear layout.

The innovative touchpad developed by Mercedes-Benz in the handrest above the controller on the centre tunnel marks a further evolutionary step. As on a smartphone, this provides for very simple and intuitive operation of all the head-unit functions using finger gestures.

The touchpad also permits letters, numbers and special characters to be entered in handwriting – in any language supported by Audio 20 or COMAND Online. The user receives clear tactile feedback when operating the touchpad’s control surface, which is highly conducive to genuine intuitive use.

A head-up display is also new to the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Like in a fighter jet, it displays important information directly in the driver’s field of vision on the front windscreen, thus providing for clear legibility and less distraction from the road ahead. The system provides information on speed, posted speed limits, navigation instructions and messages from the DISTRONIC system.

Three different design and equipment lines for the exterior and interior each offer further scope for individualisation in addition to the standard equipment and appointments. The AVANTGARDE line showcases the Mercedes-Benz C-Class as a sporty Saloon, the EXCLUSIVE line places the emphasis on an elevated status and modern luxury while the AMG Line lends the Mercedes-Benz C-Class a decidedly sporty appearance.

Rigid body – lightly done

The body-in-white of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class provides an innovative basis for reduced weight, outstanding rigidity, including load introduction rigidity for excellent handling, combined with optimum noise and vibration characteristics and a high level of crash safety. Thanks to intelligent and innovative lightweight construction, the aluminium hybrid body is around 70 kg lighter than a conventional steel body. The vehicle’s overall weight is even reduced by up to 100 kilograms. As such, the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class leads the “lightweight rankings” in its segment. This spawns numerous benefits: the lightweight construction of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class cuts fuel consumption by up to 20 percent without any loss of performance, while at the same time enabling a lower centre of gravity, which in turn gives rise to the vehicle’s noticeably sporty and agile handling.

Mercedes-Benz achieves this technological leap in lightweight construction by various measures, including a completely new design and an unusually high aluminium content for a vehicle built in large-scale series production. Compared with the successful predecessor, the aluminium content has increased from less than 10 percent to almost 50 percent.

In keeping with Mercedes-Benz traditions, the body shell is designed for exemplary crash safety. The Saloon not only meets all current national and international laws, but also all rating requirements as well as the more stringent internal Mercedes-Benz safety requirements, which are based on what actually happens in real-life accidents.

A high-strength passenger safety cell forms the core of this concept. It is surrounded by specifically computed and field-tested deformation zones, which ensure maximum safety for the occupants by virtue of optimised force paths and a combination of die-cast aluminium components and ultra-high-strength materials. An outer skin consisting almost completely of aluminium provides a protective shell for the body structure.

Leading the field in aerodynamics and quiet running

A low drag is crucial to achieving outstanding efficiency. From a speed of just under 70 km/h, aerodynamic drag exceeds the sum total of all other driving resistance factors. As such, drag constitutes a major leverage in efforts to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. With a Cd value of 0.24 for the C 220 BlueTEC BlueEFFICIENCY Edition, the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class Saloon sets a new benchmark in the medium-size category. The wind noise level, which was already very low in the preceding generation of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, has been lowered still further.

The engineers have also devoted painstaking attention to optimising other potential sources of disturbance that may have an adverse effect on the driver’s and passengers’ well-being and concentration, even though they may not consciously notice their effects. NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) is the technical term for such nuisance factors. The specialists have optimised the noise characteristics of the interior blower, the power windows, the seat adjustment functions and many other actuating and operating noises, for example. As a result, the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class occupies a benchmark position in its segment in terms of NVH.

Outstanding CO2 values with new small diesel engine

Powerful and efficient petrol and diesel engines, all equipped with the ECO start/stop function and complying with Euro 6 emissions standards, provide for lively performance and great fun at the wheel. They also cut fuel consumption by up to 20 percent compared with the preceding model.

An innovation is a small diesel engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres. Reduced weight, compact design and low specific fuel consumption are among its special merits. Depending on its configuration, the single-stage turbocharged four-cylinder engine generates 85 or 100 kW (115 or 136 hp) of power from a displacement of 1598 cc and delivers 280 or 320 Nm of torque. This engine puts the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class in a leading position within its segment in terms of CO2 emissions. Among other things, this was made possible by the first-ever use of steel pistons in a passenger car diesel engine.

In addition to this new small diesel engine, an advanced version of the proven 2.2-litre four-cylinder diesel engine is also available in several output variants. The diesel engines thus cover an output range from 85 kW (115 hp) to 150 kW (204 hp). The C 220 BlueTEC is optionally also available with an output of 120 kW (163 hp) as a BlueEFFICIENCY Edition. All diesel engines of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class are equipped with the established SCR technology (selective catalytic reduction) for particularly environment-friendly driving, and ensure that the C‑Class models with diesel engines attain at least efficiency class A, and in most cases even efficiency class A+. The only exceptions are the 4MATIC four-wheel-drive models which are rated as efficiency class B.

BlueDIRECT petrol engines with third-generation direct injection

Four-cylinder petrol engines with power outputs ranging from 115 to 180 kW (156 to 245 hp) will also be available. These include the C 180 BlueEFFICIENCY Edition special model, which qualifies for efficiency class A. A six-cylinder petrol engine rated at 245 kW (333 hp) will follow in due course.

The BlueDIRECT four-cylinder petrol engines of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class combine spontaneous response and exemplary power delivery with high efficiency and best-in-class emissions. To this end, Mercedes-Benz has transferred the BlueDIRECT technology from the V6 and V8 engines to the four-cylinder engine. The direct injection system with spray-guided combustion, first introduced into passenger-car series production by Mercedes-Benz, employs an electronically controlled precision multiple injection process. The third-generation direct injection technology is complemented by “fast multiple ignition”.

Hybrid with four-cylinder diesel and petrol engine

As in the S and E-Class, Mercedes-Benz offers a diesel engine combined with a hybrid module. The C 300 BlueTEC HYBRID with four-cylinder diesel engine and compact electric motor generates an output of 150 + 20 kW (204 + 27 hp) and runs on only 3.6 litres of diesel per 100 km/h in NEDC combined mode (provisional figure). A further particularly economical hybrid model which is to follow at a later juncture will feature state-of-the-art plug-in technology.

Optimised powertrain

Depending on the installed output ratings, Mercedes-Benz offers a new 6-speed manual transmission for the four-cylinder engines in the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class, which stands apart first and foremost by virtue of its enhanced ease of shifting coupled with increased shifting precision and a harmonious gear change sequence. Smooth automatic gear shifting is provided by the 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission, which has undergone further development at Mercedes-Benz in the interests of enhanced environment-friendliness and driving pleasure.

The 4MATIC permanent all-wheel-drive system, which will be available starting in September 2014, serves to improve traction and driving stability in the Mercedes-Benz C-Class while additionally underscoring the vehicle’s refined sportiness.

Suspension – sporty yet comfortable

The suspension on the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a totally new development. It provides for nimble and agile handling that makes driving a great pleasure on winding roads while also offering the highest standard of ride comfort in the segment.

A newly designed 4-link front axle plays a major part in the agile handling characteristics. Thanks to the 4-link principle, the wheel suspension is fully decoupled from the spring strut. The resultant favourable axle kinematics allow more grip and higher cornering forces. As a result, the suspension responds more sensitively to steering movements and allows a sporty, agile driving style. An optimised multi-link independent rear suspension with 5‑links ensures unsurpassed wheel location qualities and supreme straight-line stability.

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class Saloon is fitted as standard with a steel suspension. Three DIRECT CONTROL suspensions with selective damping system are available in conjunction with this suspension:

a comfort suspension

a comfortable Avantgarde suspension lowered by 15 millimetres

a sports suspension lowered by 15 millimetres

First air suspension in this category

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class is the first vehicle in its segment that can be fitted with an optional air suspension (AIRMATIC) on the front and rear axle. Thanks to electronically controlled, continuously variable damping at the front and rear, it offers outstanding road roar and tyre vibration characteristics even with the vehicle loaded. The driver can use a switch to choose between the various characteristics: “Comfort”, “ECO”, “Sport” and “Sport+”. The additional “Individual” setting enables drivers to configure their vehicle according to their own preferences. AIRMATIC also features all-round self-levelling for optimum ride comfort even with the vehicle loaded.

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class also comes with an electric parking brake as standard. This brake is released automatically when the driver ends parking mode with the aim of moving off.

Steering with a sporty character

All models of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class family will feature an electromechanical Direct-Steer system as standard from now on. This combines road-speed-dependent power assistance from the speed-sensitive power steering system with a steering ratio that varies with the given steering angle. The power steering assistance provided by the rack-and-pinion steering gear is controlled as needed, thereby contributing towards efficiency.

Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive: the intelligent car

It is the declared aim of Mercedes-Benz to make the highest standard of safety available to everyone. To this end, the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class incorporates almost all of the new assistance systems with a host of enhanced functions which celebrated their world premiere in the S-Class and E-Class only a few months ago. The assistance systems enhance both comfort and safety. Mercedes-Benz calls this Intelligent Drive.

The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class offers numerous innovative safety and assistance systems. It is equipped as standard with ATTENTION ASSIST, which can warn the driver of inattentiveness and fatigue. On motorways the COMAND Online navigation function offers nearby break options as stopovers, providing the system has been specified in the vehicle. The ATTENTION ASSIST function offers an adjustable level of sensitivity and can inform drivers in a separate view in the instrument cluster about their level of drowsiness and how long they have been driving since their last break.

In addition to Adaptive Brake Assist, which offers protection from collisions from speeds as low as 7 km/h, standard-fit COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS also features an additional function: when the risk of collision persists and the driver fails to respond, the system is able to carry out autonomous braking at speeds of up to 200 km/h, thereby reducing the severity of collisions with slower or stopping vehicles. The system also brakes in response to stationary vehicles at a speed of up to 50 km/h, and is able to prevent rear-end collisions at up to 40 km/h.

In addition, new assistance systems and existing assistance systems with significantly enhanced functions from the new S-Class and E-Class are also optionally available, combining data from various sensor technologies as part of the Intelligent Drive concept to substantially enhance comfort and safety:

DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist and integrated Stop&Go Pilot is a semi-autonomous Stop-and-Go assist system, which in addition to using the lane markings is able to follow the vehicle ahead at speeds below 60 km/h, thus providing a safe and convenient means of following the flow of traffic.

BAS PLUS Brake Assist can now also detect crossing traffic and boost the braking force if the driver fails to apply the brakes sufficiently; the PRE-SAFE® Brake can detect stationary vehicles and even pedestrians, brake autonomously if the driver fails to react and thus prevent accidents at speeds of up 50 km/h and mitigate the severity of collisions at speeds of up to 72 km/h. In flowing traffic the PRE-SAFE® Brake provides assistance according to the same mode of operation throughout the speed range from 7 to 200 km/h.

Enhanced Active Lane Keeping Assist can now also prevent the vehicle from unintentionally drifting out of lane by applying the brakes on one side when the lane markings are broken and there is a risk of collision, e.g. as a result of vehicles overtaking at high speed, parallel traffic or even oncoming traffic.

The numerous assistance systems also include

on parking spaces,

a 360° camera, which is able to show the vehicle and its surroundings from various perspectives, including a virtual bird’s-eye view,

Traffic Sign Assist with wrong-way warning function, which warns of speed limits and alerts the driver to no-overtaking zones and no-entry signs, as well as

Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus, which allows the high-beam headlamps to be kept on permanently without dazzling traffic by masking out other vehicles in the light cone of the high-beam headlamps.

Airbags for safety

In addition to 3-point safety belts with pyrotechnical belt tensioning and belt-force limitation for driver, front passenger and those in the outer rear seats, numerous airbags serve to protect the vehicle’s occupants in an accident. These include:

combined thorax/pelvis sidebags for driver and front passenger

a newly developed windowbag

sidebags for the outer rear seats (optional)

a kneebag for the driver

The front passenger seat can additionally be fitted with automatic child seat recognition, which dispenses with the previous transponder in favour of a weight mat. This enables any child seat to be used. The airbag is automatically deactivated when a child seat is fitted and reactivated once it has been removed.

Air conditioning: signals from space

Mercedes-Benz has systematically advanced and substantially improved the air conditioning system in the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class. This applies in particular to the control quality, performance, efficiency and air quality. The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class is also the only vehicle in the segment to offer tunnel detection via satellite navigation. It uses map data from the navigation system and the GPS location data to close the air-recirculation flap automatically when the vehicle enters a tunnel, subsequently re-opening it when the vehicle emerges from the tunnel.

Another highlight contributing to a feel-good atmosphere is the AIR-BALANCE package with active fragrancing, air ionisation and more efficient filtration than is available on the base model.

Vibrant infotainment

A completely new multimedia generation offers intuitive operation in the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class, featuring elaborate animations and visual effects which present all the functions in a clear and highly attractive manner. Furthermore the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class is equipped with the unique Frontbass system. This avant-garde acoustic system uses the space within the cross-member and side member in the body structure as a resonance chamber for the woofers. The result is a listening experience almost on a par with a concert hall. A Burmester® surround sound system is optionally available.

The navigation system presents its contents in interactive mode. Its features include an animated compass, a “Drive Show” with information for passengers similar to the on-screen presentations on board airliners and Google Maps displayed on the head unit. COMAND Online is now also able to provide more accurate real-time information about the situation on the roads when it receives its traffic data via the internet by means of the “Live Traffic Information” service.

Internet and diverse data sources already available in the basic version

A Bluetooth®-capable mobile phone with data option is all it takes to make the Audio 20 system internet-capable. This enables surfing the internet without restrictions when the vehicle is stationary.

Mercedes-Benz Apps such as Weather, GoogleTM Local Search with StreetView and Panoramio, destination/route download and Facebook can be used while on the move in conjunction with COMAND Online. Audio and video playback is possible from various sources, for example, via Bluetooth®, from an Apple iPod or iPhone®, from an SD card, USB stick or CD/DVD (with Audio 20 CD or higher and with COMAND Online).

COMAND Online with hotspot functionality

COMAND Online not only offers a larger display with a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels and a special bonded glass cover such as is familiar from consumer devices like the iPhone® or iPad. It also enables digital TV / radio reception, for example, and offers a host of other features including fast hard-disc navigation, automatic tailback avoidance via up-to-date and accurate “Live Traffic Information” traffic data, integrated WLAN hotspot functionality and the LINGUATRONIC voice-operated control system.

Telephony via Bluetooth® as standard

The basic system Audio 20, the Audio 20 CD and COMAND Online all come with a basic telephony feature as standard, which connects the mobile phone with the vehicle via a standardised Bluetooth® interface.##2394|Empty##2395|Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) says that activist investor Bill Ackman’s presentation reflects his “continued failure to fundamentally understand” its business model. The company also said in its press release that it would keep collaborating with China’s government to ensure that its business model operates within the country’s laws for direct selling.

Herbalife: China business model is unique

In Tuesday’s presentation, Ackman drew comparisons between the percentages Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) uses in determining how much it should pay distributors. He used the company’s financial statements to suggest that it uses the same business model in China that it does in the rest of the world. He also listed several ways in which the experts he hired said Herbalife is operating in violation of Chinese laws regarding direct sales.

However, Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) maintains that it has a different business model for its China operations. The company said it is compliant with all of China’s laws and regulations. The nutritional supplements company said it has a “robust training program” which is designed to ensure that its “sales representatives and service providers comply with all aspects of Chinese consumer protection laws.

Herbalife partners with Chinese officials

The company states that it has “regularly partnered with local, regional, and national Chinese government officials in seeking out and penalizing those who violate Chinese laws and Herbalife (China)’s rules.” The company also states that it is working with the Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce to “continue to eliminate illegal direct sales activities.”

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) said it has nearly 150,000 Preferred Customers in China who buy its products for self-consumption rather than distribution and 3,000 Nutrition Clubs in the country. It said those clubs each have their own license from the Chinese government.

Ackman continues to fight Herbalife… to no avail

[drizzle]

Bill Ackman’s battle to discredit Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) as a pyramid scheme has gone on for more than a year now. Unfortunately for him, investors don’t seem too worried about it, as share prices have risen since 2013 when the company continued to post strong results. The stock has fallen off after hitting new record highs, but shares remain fairly close to where they were before Ackman announced his large short position in the stock.

Paul on Monday described the movement of Russian troops into the Crimean Peninsula as a gross violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and argued it is the United States’ responsibility to take the lead in condemning it.

He also criticized President Obama's policies toward Russia, arguing they have emboldened Putin.

“The real problem is that Russia’s president is not currently fearful or threatened in any way by America’s president, despite his country’s blatant aggression,” Paul wrote in a Time magazine op-ed. “But let me be clear: If I were president, I wouldn’t let Vladimir Putin get away with it.”

Paul, fresh off a straw poll victory at the Conservative Political Action Conference, called on the administration to suspend all U.S. aid and loans to Ukraine. He argued that money would just end up in Russia's hands, given Ukraine's gas bill to Russian-owned Gazprom.

Paul did not mention the House's passage last week of $1 billion loan guarantees to Ukraine.

“Currently, these could have the counterproductive effect of rewarding Russia,” he said. “Ukraine owes so much money to Russia that America would essentially be borrowing from China to give to Ukraine.”

Paul argued the U.S. should immediately remove any obstacle preventing the U.S. from exporting natural gas to Europe. He argued that step would make Europe less dependent on Russian natural gas.

"Because of so many of our current needless laws and regulations, President Obama has left Europe completely vulnerable because of its dependence on Russian oil and gas," Paul said.

He also called for the immediate approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.

He said he would also reinstate missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republican but would make sure European allies pay for it. Paul said turmoil around the world cannot let the United States forget it is “broke.”

Paul also offered backing for economic sanctions and blocking Russian officials' visas, saying they should be imposed without delay. The White House announced sanctions last week but has yet to impose them on specific Russian entities or officials.

He said the U.S. should take the lead in boycotting the G-8 summit in Sochi later this summer and remove Russia from the group if its troops still occupy Crimea at the time of the meeting.

“This does not and should not require military action,” he said. “No one in the U.S. is calling for this. But it will require other actions and leadership, both of which President Obama unfortunately lacks.”

Finally, Paul argued that the biggest threat to U.S. security is its debt.

“Like Dwight Eisenhower, I believe the U.S. can actually be stronger by doing less,” he said. “Like Ronald Reagan, particularly regarding Russia, I also believe, ‘Don’t mistake our reluctance for war for a lack of resolve.’ ”##2398|The deadline to sign up for some kind of medical bill payment program is still two weeks away, but it is already obvious to anyone who has been paying attention that the Affordable Care Act — the inaccurate euphemism by which Obamacare is often known — is a complete failure and will never be enacted.



It's not the Republican Party's steadfast opposition that led to Obamacare's demise, though.

Almost as soon as the Democrats passed the bill so we could find out what was in it, the Obama administration began to grant waiver after waiver to various groups and organizations, usually (and not coincidentally) elements of the Democratic Party’s coalition.

Then came the stupendously disastrous rollout of the federal government’s Obamacare website.

Then came the wave of insurance policy cancellations, leading to the revelation that when Obama repeatedly said, “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,” he was knowingly, deliberately lying. To be sure, that shouldn’t have been a revelation to anyone who was paying attention or anyone who is wise to the ways of politicians, but most people don’t pay attention and aren’t as wise to politicians’ ways as they should be (or as they may think they are).

That was followed by another waiver — one that potentially could gut the law: In some cases, people would be allowed to ask their insurance providers if they can have their old, superior policies back, even though their old policies don’t comply with Obamacare’s requirements.

Among the other waivers granted by the Obama administration, the “employer mandate” to provide staff with at least basic coverage or face a fine has been delayed, and those whose plans were canceled will be temporarily exempt from the “individual mandate” to purchase health insurance.

Initially the exemption would have expired in September this year, but the White House was not about to let that happen right before midterm elections in which ObamaDebacle is expected to help the Republicans pick up Senate seats and perhaps win back control of Congress.

And so, early this month, came another waiver. A really big one — so big, it wasn’t even announced.

Now some people will be allowed to renew their non-compliant policies until 2016, by which time the president will be preparing to leave the White House and will no longer have to worry about the political consequences of this rotten law. Millions of Americans will be allowed to avoid paying the individual mandate penalty by claiming that the cancellation of their policies constitutes “hardship.”

When news of this serious revision of the Obamacare law finally got out last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius initially testified before the House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday that the reports were “not accurate” … only to backtrack and concede that the reports were accurate after all. (In that, she at least shows herself to be more honorable and honest than Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who still has not retracted his claim that all of the insurance cancellation horror stories that the press has been reporting are fake.)

What makes this latest Obamacare waiver such a big deal is that Obamacare simply doesn’t work without the individual mandate — unless nearly everyone is forced to either buy extremely expensive health insurance or sign up for welfare, the entire system breaks down. To pay the high medical costs of those who are high-risk, such as those with preexisting conditions, and to pay for all of the “free” contraceptive and abortifacient drugs and procedures, insurance companies need everyone to buy their health plans. Once you start exempting millions of Americans who otherwise would have had to comply with the new law, it all falls apart.

Thus, we find ourselves watching the insane spectacle of the president effectively repealing and delaying the individual mandate while threatening to veto any bill that repeals or delays the individual mandate.

Here’s what I want to know: If the powers that be never had any real intention of enacting and enforcing this monstrosity of a law, why did they bother to foist it on an unwilling populace in the first place? They could have saved us, and our employers and insurance providers a lot of trouble.

Unless a lot of trouble was the whole point all along?

* Clashes between rebels, pro-government militias reported

* Western powers fear chaos in oil-producing Libya (Adds Zeidan banned from travelling abroad, paragraph 8)

By Ulf Laessing and Feras Bosalum

TRIPOLI, March 11 (Reuters) - Libya’s parliament voted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan out of office on Tuesday after rebels humiliated the government by loading crude on a tanker that fled from naval forces, officials said, in a sign of the worsening chaos in the OPEC member state.

Libyan gunboats later chased the tanker along Libya’s eastern Mediterranean coast and opened fire, damaging it, a military spokesman said. Italian naval ships were helping move the tanker to a Libyan government-controlled port, he said. But Italy denied any of its vessels were in the area at the time and the reported firing incident could not be confirmed.

Western powers fear the vast North African state could even break apart with the government struggling to rein in armed militias and tribesmen who helped oust dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but want to grab power and oil revenues.

Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, will be temporarily replaced by Defence Minister Abdallah al-Thinni, who was sworn in by parliament on Tuesday evening.

Zeidan, who came to power in 2012 after Libya’s first free parliamentary vote following four decades of quirky one-man rule by Gaddafi, had been facing opposition from Islamists and the public blaming him for Libya’s anarchic transition since 2011.

Deputies said they had decided to mount a no-confidence vote after the tanker managed to sail away from Es Sider port, one of three major export terminals the government has lost to rebels.

“The government has been weakened for a time and we need a new personality,” said al-Sharif al-Wafi, an independent lawmaker. A new prime minister will be elected by deputies within two weeks, he said.

State prosecutor Abdel-Qader Radwan said later he had banned Zeidan from travelling abroad because he faced an investigation over alleged financial irregularities.

Zeidan told Reuters late on Monday in an interview that navy forces had halted the tanker and were escorting it to a government-controlled port in western Libya.

But rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran mocked Zeidan by going on television hours later while standing on a ship, insisting his forces still controlled the 37,000-tonne tanker.

When Libyans woke up the next morning officials had to admit the North Korea-flagged tanker had escaped at dawn, making it the first sale of crude bypassing the Tripoli government.

Walid al-Tarhouni, spokesman for the national oil protection forces, said navy boats chased the tanker hours later east of Benghazi, further east, and opened fire.

“The ship was damaged and it is not moving,” he said. Italian ships were helping to shift the tanker to a government-run port, he said. But the Italian defence ministry denied any of its vessels had been in the area at the time.

It was not possible to verify the firing incident at sea. Government and rebels have given conflicting accounts of the tanker saga.

It was unclear where the tanker had planned to sail. Government officials say the ship was flagged in North Korea, a flag of convenience to keep the ownership secret.

TRANSITION GETS MORE COMPLICATED

Zeidan’s exit gave joy to his many opponents but it complicates Libya’s transition as there is no obvious successor who can unite the feuding parties in a country with no tradition of political institutions.

Analysts said Zeidan was not to blame for many problems such as lack of development since the ousting of Gaddafi as the government was simply running out of money due to a wave of protests at oilfields and ports. Oil is Libya’s lifeline.

Zeidan had accused the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists of blocking budget payments for infrastructure projects and improved army and police forces to make him fail.

Parliament will support acting prime minister Thinni and not obstruct his work, its head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain told the assembly after the defence minister gave his oath.

But while he spoke, clashes erupted in the central city of Sirte west of Es Sider port where rebels were fighting pro-government forces assembled to end the blockages of oil ports.

Rebel gunmen had blocked the gate to an air base in Sirte, the only main air force base in the region. Residents said fighters on both sides had been wounded though no details were immediately available.

In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said.

Western diplomats worry the conflict over oil might dismember Libya as rebels demand autonomy for the east, which was neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte.

The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.

They want to restore political autonomy with the historic eastern Cyrenaica region which shared power and wealth with Tripolitania in the west under King Idris, who preceded Gaddafi.

Libya has been trying to rebuild its armed forces since Gaddafi’s overthrow, but analysts say they are not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising against the veteran strongman.

(HLF) following more than a year of scrutiny over its business practices. Shares of the company, which sells vitamins, shakes and other supplements, nosedived as much as 15% after being briefly halted.

After reiterating its willingness to fully cooperate with the FTC, Herbalife said it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace.”

On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has called the company a “massive pyramid scheme” and has placed a $1.16 billion short bet against it, stepped up his battle against Herbalife by accusing it of operating illegally in China.

“We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years,” the company said in a statement.

Herbalife’s shares have recovered slightly in midday trading and are currently down $5.82, or 8.90%, at $59.67. HLF hit an intraday low of $54.59, or 17%, at one point after the FTC news hit the wires.

NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday, as equities recouped much of their earlier declines amid signs of progress in diplomatic attempts to ease tensions surrounding Ukraine.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will meet with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in London on Friday ahead of a referendum Sunday on whether the Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula will join Russia or go independent.

“People are just kind of reassessing, they are looking at that headline and thinking maybe it is not going to turn out to be a disaster in Russia and Ukraine,” said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York.

“It’s good they are talking and it’s good Kerry is going to do it before the weekend - if they do something on Friday to allay any fear over the weekend, that is a positive.”

Stocks had fallen earlier in the session on concerns about a weakening economy in China. London copper, seen as a proxy for China’s economic health, rebounded after hitting its lowest level since July 2010.

Geopolitical developments have moved to the forefront this week as a dearth of fresh corporate results and economic data offered no catalysts to push the benchmark S&P index above its most recent record close on Friday.

“We’ve climbed so far, to continue to climb is definitely going to be a see-saw move,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Ukraine’s government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea, but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalize rule from Moscow within days.

EU member states have agreed the wording of sanctions on Russia, including travel restrictions and asset freezes against those responsible for violating the sovereignty of Ukraine, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.54 points, or 0.09 percent, to 16,336.71, the S&P 500 lost 2.16 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,865.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.291 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,313.478.

EPL Oil & Gas Inc jumped 29.4 percent to $37.65 after the company agreed to be acquired by larger rival Energy XXI Ltd for $2.3 billion, including debt. Energy XXI shares lost 6.3 percent to $21.90.

Express Inc dropped 11.3 percent to $16.18 after the apparel retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a profit for the current quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations.

Oxigene Inc surged 103.7 percent to $4.93. The company said its experimental drug Zybrestat, combined with Roche’s cancer drug Avastin, significantly slowed progression of recurrent ovarian cancer better than Avastin alone in a midstage clinical trial.

Geron Corp plunged 63.2 percent to $1.82. The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered a halt to trials of its cancer drug imetelstat over concerns about potential liver damage.

Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at $1,355 an ounce, said traders. Other precious metals were higher too, with silver climbing over 1 percent.

"There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals," said one Hong Kong-based precious metals. "It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well.

"With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold's downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets." Spot gold had gained 0.6 percent to $1,357.11 an ounce by 0309 GMT, after earlier hitting $1,359.25 - its highest since October 29. The metal gained 0.8 percent on Tuesday.

Bullion has gained 13 percent this year following a 28 percent drop in 2013, on escalating uncertainties around the world.

Ukraine's government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise rule from Moscow within days.

China's first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world's second-biggest economy. Copper and iron ore prices have been hit the hardest.

In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock.

In China, the world's biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about $3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of $20.

Pakistan has extended its ban on gold imports to March 31, as it tries to stop smuggling to India where high import duties have made supplies scarce.##2406|An Alibaba employee walks through a communal space at the company headquarters in Hangzhou on June 20, 2012

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba confirmed on Sunday it plans to list in the United States after ruling out Hong Kong and London.

"Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States. This will make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals," the company said in a statement, confirming recent media reports.

Analysts say the listing is expected to raise about $10 billion, which would make it the technology industry's largest IPO since Facebook's in 2012.

Talks between the world's largest online retailer and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange broke down last year, in part because the city's listing rules prevented Alibaba founder Jack Ma and senior management retaining some control over the board of directors.

Alibaba wanted an alternative class share structure to give selected minority shareholders extra control over the board, but the Hong Kong bourse declined to change its rules.

"We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to, and support the process of innovation and development of, Hong Kong," the statement said.

"Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China."

The Wall Street Journal has reported that Alibaba could launch its IPO as soon as April, which could allow trading to begin by the third quarter.

The report said up to five banks may be given lead underwriting roles.

Alibaba operates China's most popular e-shopping platform, Taobao, which has more than 90 percent of the online market for consumer-to-consumer transactions.

Taobao has more than 800 million product listings and over 500 million users.##2407|Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and Ranking Member Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, announced that they have reached an agreement on a housing finance reform proposal.

Last fall, the Senate Banking Committee hosted an in-depth series of hearings exploring essential elements necessary for reform.

Johnson and Crapo worked together to contain guarantee costs at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as agreements to help maintain solvency at the Federal Housing Administration.

Sponsor Content

For the past few months they have been negotiating and drafting the reform proposal and plan to introduce the legislation soon.

Here is the 10-point path Johnson and Crapo plan to completely reform housing in the United States.

1. Wind down and eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

2. Promote a smooth and stable transition from the old system to the new system by providing specific benchmarks and timelines to guide Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation – this will be modeled on the FDIC.

3. Keep current conforming loan limits so that mortgage credit continues to be available in high-cost areas.

4. Keep the To-Be-Announced secondary market liquid and direct FMIC to "take into account" the impact of new products on the TBA market.

5. Mandate 10% private capital, up front, and create a mortgage insurance fund for the system to protect taxpayers against future bailouts. We've seen these kinds of deals already.

6. Add multifamily as an asset class to those same risk-sharing mechanisms mentioned in point 5.

7. Create a member-owned securitization platform that will issue a single, standardized FMIC-wrapped security.

8. Establish a mutual cooperative jointly owned by small lenders to ensure institutions of all sizes have direct access to the secondary market so community banks and credit unions are not at the mercy of their larger competitors when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are dissolved.

8a.The small lender mutual cooperative would provide a cash window for individual eligible loans, and small lenders could retain servicing rights.

9. Require strong underwriting standards that mirror the definition of “qualified mortgage”, and set down payment requirement at 5% (with a short phase-in) except for first-time homebuyers at 3.5%.

10. Eliminate affordable housing goals and establish transparent and accountable housing-related funds that would focus on ensuring there is sufficient decent housing available. The funds are NOT paid for with tax dollars, but through a small FMIC user fee (10 basis points) that only those who choose to use the system pay.

10a. Despite the elimination of affordable housing goals, the reformed housing market will still facilitate the broad availability of credit for eligible single-family and multifamily borrowers, monitor consumer and market access to credit, and provide market based incentives and transparency to serve underserved areas.

“This agreement moves us closer to ending the five-year status quo and beginning the wind down of Fannie and Freddie while protecting taxpayers with strong private capital, building the components for a stable secondary market and avoiding repeating the mistakes of the past,” Crapo said. “Government control of Fannie and Freddie with no private capital to protect taxpayers against losses is unacceptable."##2408|Seoul (dpa) - An overview of venues to be used to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games in 2018.Pyeongchang Mountain ClusterLocated around 180 kilometres east of Seoul in the Gangwon province.

Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are expected to get equal billing for their jobs as co-lead underwriters of the IPO, according to people familiar with matter.

The Chinese e-commerce company also is considering paying the banks about the same fee, though a final decision hasn't been made and plans may shift, the people said.

With that arrangement, Alibaba would be making a break from recent large Internet IPOs, including those of Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., which each paid one bank far more than the others that were named to senior roles.

In the Facebook and Twitter deals, respective lead banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs received nearly twice the fees of the next tier of underwriters, according to company filings.

Alibaba, whose websites conduct more business than Amazon.com Inc.'s, said in a statement over the weekend that it has started its long-awaited march to an IPO in the U.S. after initially weighing a deal in Hong Kong.

The company picked the banks as co-leads of the planned share sale, The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend.

The IPO, which could come as soon as this summer, may raise more than $15 billion, making it one of the largest ever in the U.S., people familiar with the matter said.

That could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars in fees and other business to banks and exchanges in the U.S.

Lead banks in IPOs perform multiple tasks, including advising the company on pricing of the shares, acting as liaison with investors, orchestrating the marketing of the deal and overseeing the trading of the stock after it hits the market.

More-junior banks are typically used to solicit investors.

Alibaba plans to list the banks on the initial prospectus in alphabetical order, to reflect their equal status, the people familiar with the matter said. But it isn't clear how Alibaba will split up the specific responsibilities, they said.

Banks have shared equal representation on other large U.S. IPOs, such as those by Visa Inc. and General Motors Co., with some still getting paid much more.

Visa, in its $19.7 billion offering in 2008, named eight banks as lead underwriters, but two of them, J.P. Morgan and Goldman, had additional responsibilities and were paid three times what the next bank got, according to a filing.

In general, however, banks are more often being asked to share credit for deals. This has put pressure on the compensation that any individual bank gets from an IPO, even if overall fee rates--around 7% of proceeds for typical IPOs--have been steady. In 2000, less than 8% of IPOs featured more than one "bookrunner," according to a study by Keating Capital Inc., a fund that invests in pre-IPO companies. But in 2010, 83% of IPOs had multiple bookrunners, the study found.

In addition, big companies have often paid far less than the standard 7% rate for leading IPOs. Of the five largest U.S. IPOs since 2000, none paid more than 2.8%, which was Visa, according to Ipreo, which collects capital-markets data. Facebook paid 1.1%, and General Motors paid 0.75%, Ipreo said.

Even so, with 1% of a potential $15 billion IPO, fees could be $150 million.

There are still other remaining contests on Wall Street tied to the Alibaba deal, such as whether the New York Stock Exchange, owned by IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc., or rival Nasdaq Stock Market, owned by Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., will be the venue where the shares will be listed. Nasdaq snagged, but bungled, Facebook's IPO in 2012, while NYSE had smoother sailing last year with Twitter's.

The banks working on the deal have had past relationships with the company. Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, for example, have worked on multiple deals for Alibaba recently, including Alibaba's restructuring of its relationship with Yahoo Inc. and when it has raised other forms of capital. The two banks have been working with the company on its IPO preparation, the people familiar said.

Some of the banks have also featured Alibaba at recent conferences. Credit Suisse hosted Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman and the person tasked with running the IPO, at its December technology conference in Phoenix.

In March, Mr. Tsai was also at Morgan Stanley's technology conference in San Francisco.

Also this month, in March, Mr. Tsai and Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder and executive chairman, were at J.P. Morgan's CEO Summit event in New York, hosted by J.P. Morgan Chief Executive James Dimon and Vice Chairman James B. Lee Jr.

Emails: Separate multiple email addresses with semi-colon Your Email: Send email to me as well Subject: Comments: 200 character limit.

Four Central European nations are urging the United States to boost natural gas exports to Europe as a hedge against the risk that Russia could cut its supply of gas to Ukraine.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Four Central European nations are urging the United States to boost natural gas exports to Europe as a hedge against the risk that Russia could cut its supply of gas to Ukraine, but the White House says such a move would take more than a year.

Ambassadors from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic made their appeal Friday in a letter to John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. A similar letter was expected to be sent to Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate.

The letter from the four nations, known as the Visegrad Group, asks for Congress to support speedier approval of natural gas exports. It notes that the "presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in Central and Eastern Europe."

The ambassadors say the unrest in Ukraine has revived Cold War memories, and energy security threatens the region's residents daily.

"Gas-to-gas competition in our region is a vital aspect of national security and a keyU.S. interest in the region," the ambassadors wrote in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.

Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, and previous disputes betweenUkraine and Russia have led to supply cuts. Russian state company Gazprom has increased the pressure on Ukraine's new government — which already owes $1.89 billion (1.36 billion euros) for past deliveries — by warning that if Ukraine doesn't pay its debts, Russia could retaliate by cutting off wider supplies to Europe, as happened in 2009.

Recent advancements have made it possible for Russian gas that normally flows to European Union customers through Ukraine to flow in the other direction, so Poland and Hungary could supply gas to Ukraine if Russian supplies halted. But with gassupplies limited, the region remains vulnerable unless the U.S. makes it easier to import American natural gas, the ambassadors argued.

Since he took over as Chiquita’s CEO in October 2012, Ed Longergan has aggressively reversed the company’s money-losing diversification strategy, vowing instead to concentrate on bananas and salads. The merger seems to help with that; some 71% of the new company’s sales will come from bananas, compared with 65% of Chiquita’s.

But look at it another way, and you see the deal boosting its “other produce category” from the current 4% to 9%—a funny move for a company dead-set on un-diversifying. Assuming the new company passes antitrust muster, a lot of ChiquitaFyffes’ new non-banana business will come from melons and pineapples, in which Fyffes has been investing pretty heavily (pdf, p.19).

Fyffes ​

Why would Chiquita be reversing course, abandoning the diversification strategy that saw it shed grape and avocado production?

For one thing, both melons and pineapples are proving promising for Fyffes. The company’s melon business focuses on the US, where sales have more than doubled since 2008, and it became the top melon-seller in 2011. As for pineapples, while its sales trail those of Fresh Del Monte and Dole in both Europe and the US, Fyffes’ share has been steadily increasing. Neither division would be easily sold off. Fyffes has invested heavily in expanding cultivation of both types of fruit in Latin America; its now grows all of its melons and 56% of its pineapples there.

But another reason might be the rising risk that banana diseases pose to the industry. We recently discussed how an invincible fungus called Panama disease will inevitably threaten banana plantations in Latin America, where the vast majority of export bananas are grown. A more immediate menace is Black Sigatoka, a disease that typically causes losses of 50%-80% of any crop it strikes and is already a severe problem in a slew of Latin American countries. That disease and others force growers to use more pesticides, causing a sharp spike in costs. The growing torrents of chemicals that farmers have to pour on their banana crops is also upping concerns about environmental destruction and harm to workers.

One other thing to note is that Chiquita is not in great financial shape; as of Aug. 2013, its $602 million in total debt was the second-highest relative to earnings among 32 similar packaged-food and meat companies in the US, reports Bloomberg. Which is why it’s interesting that, despite the fact that Chiquita is much bigger than Fyffes, the new company will be based in Ireland, Fyffes’ home country, rather than Chiquita’s home, the US. As Quartz’s Tim Fernholz recently noted, Ireland has an incredibly low corporate tax rate. And for Chiquita, a company struggling to up its cash flow, that certainly can’t hurt.##2419|It was just seven weeks ago that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) offered a fairly specific vow. “This year, we will rally around an alternative to ObamaCare and pass it on the floor of the House,” he said on Jan. 30. A month later, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said GOP leaders would have “conversations” with members about possible ideas that could go into a theoretical alternative to the Affordable Care Act.

It was hard to miss the incompatibility of Cantor’s promise and Boehner’s half-hearted hedge.

That said, Robert Costa reports that House Republican leaders are still moving towards some kind of reform blueprint to present to voters in advance of the 2014 midterms. It’ll apparently be called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind.”

The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together. The tenets of the plan – which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations – are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.

Let me get this straight. It took House Republican leaders five years of secret meetings, held far from public view, to come up an outline of ideas we already knew they supported?

Costa added that this will be “the first time … House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles,” and that’s certainly nice. But (a) they’ve spent five years promising a bill, not a set of principles; (b) what’s needed are specific provisions that can be scored, not vague blueprints; and (c) the Affordable Care Act already has some of the Republicans’ favorite provisions in it.

Or put another way, health care policy is hard. A political party that’s serious about substance and policy outcomes will have to invest a lot of time and energy into crafting a health care plan that works.

And yet, at this point, the Republican approach rests with presenting a fragile coin. On one side of the coin we see a bunch of hollow complaints about the ACA; on the other side we see a list of ideas Republicans have always liked, but which do not amount to a real, credible plan.

“We’ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Costa.

That’s actually a compelling point, and a side-by-side comparison would contribute quite a bit to the debate. Which party’s approach would cover more of the uninsured? Which offers more consumer protections? Which would improve the nation’s long-term finances? Which would do more to help lower costs within the system without sacrificing quality of care?##2420|CSI Media have been named as a Top UK Web Designer by Clutch in the 2018 awards!

Relief that Crimea remained largely calm over the weekend helped European shares recover 0.2 percent after Friday's sharp sell-off, though the poor Chinese export numbers and general global uncertainty provided a subdued backdrop.



Merger activity in France spurred the CAC 40 but mining firms sensitive to China's appetite for raw materials weighed on Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE and German firms' exposure to Russia saw the Dax underperform again.



"People sold on Friday on fear of an escalation in Crimea, but things seem to have stabilized now so it's tempting to buy the dip," said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris.



Investors in Asia started the new week on a cautious note as China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18 percent year-on-year in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.



The soft data put a damper on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report that had provided a welcome respite from a run of disappointing data.



China's CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 percent on Monday to its lowest in nearly nine months, copper, of which China is a major consumer, hit a four-year low in Shanghai, while the commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars also suffered.



MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) posted its biggest fall in over a month as it lost 1.4 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei stock average shed 1 percent, as disappointing Japanese GDP data compounded the woes.



UKRAINE



Russian forces tightened their grip on Crimea over the weekend, seizing another border post and a military airfield, ahead of a planned Moscow-backed referendum on Sunday on whether the Black Sea peninsula should join Russia.



But diplomatic efforts to cool the crisis continued to calm markets as all sides expressed unease but a general desire to prevent the tensions escalating.



The Chinese trade data weighed on currency markets.



The Chinese yuan opened down 0.5 percent and Chinese short-term rates fell amid speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly economic growth.



The Australian and Canadian dollars, which are highly sensitive to China's appetite for their raw materials, lost as much as half a percent against a broadly steady U.S. dollar



"The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure," said Alvin Tan, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.



The euro, in contrast, stayed within striking distance of Friday's 2-1/2 year high peak at $1.3875, touched after the European Central Bank suggested last week that the euro zone recovery was on track with no need for an extra policy push for now. That has pushed rate cut bets back.



COPPER SUFFERS



Gold edged lower for a second straight session on Monday after the strong U.S. jobs data on Friday eased fears of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal's safe-haven appeal.







However, the crisis in Ukraine was likely to remain a key theme for the precious metal. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week as geopolitical tensions boosted speculative interest to its highest in more than a year.



The Chinese data helped send Brent and U.S. crude down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two straight days of gains. Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya capped the falls.



"The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility," said Victor Shum, vice president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight.



The drop in China's exports pushed three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange down 1.7 percent to $6,663.75 a metric ton (7345.5 tons). It earlier slid as far as $6,608 a ton, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010.

The Paris-based think-tank for 34 mainly developed country governments says taht the recovery is advancing well in the United States and the United Kingdom, but proceeding more unevenly in Japan and still lagging behind in the Eurozone. A series of one-off factors – severe winter weather in North America and anticipation of an April 1st rise in Japanese consumption tax – have led to an uneven pace of growth.

Some major emerging economies continue growing at a fast pace, including China, but others have lost momentum. Tighter financial conditions are compounding the growth slowdown in emerging economies.

The OECD projects that the US will grow at an annualised rate of 3.1% in the second quarter of 2014, after first quarter activity was affected adversely by exceptionally cold weather. Extreme weather also impacted Canada, which is expected to experience similarly uneven growth in the first quarter, followed by a bounce back in the second quarter that should push the growth rate up to 2.4%.

In Japan, planned fiscal consolidation is projected to cut into near-term growth. Implementation of a higher consumption tax rate is expected to result in a surge in activity in the current quarter, as consumers bring forward purchases, pushing growth up to an annualised rate of 4.8%. This will be counterbalanced by a contraction of activity in the second quarter before a more normal pattern of recovery gets back on track.

The UK is projected to grow at annualised rates above 3% in the first and second quarters, but the Eurozone’s growth rate - while improving - still lags that of other advanced economies.

Wide disparities are still seen in Europe, where the three largest economies (Germany, France and Italy) will grow at a combined weighted average of 1.9% rate in the first quarter and a 1.4% pace in the second. Germany is forecast to grow by about 3.7% annualised in the first quarter and 2.5% in the second quarter, while the French economy’s annualised growth rate will hover around 1% and Italy’s will remain below 1% for each of the first two quarters.

Ireland

The OECD says short-term indicators signal that activity is regaining strength, and exports are expected to be the main source of growth in the years ahead, notwithstanding the expiry of some drug patents. High debts continue to constrain households’ and firms’ spending, although the housing market is showing the first signs of stabilisation. Inflationary pressures are expected to remain weak.

The think-tank says rising non-performing loans are weakening banks and SMEs continue to experience difficulties in accessing credit. Lending conditions remain among the tightest in Europe. The strategy set out by the Central Bank of Ireland, including quarterly quantitative targets for dealing with mortgage arrears, should be fully implemented to foster on-going balance sheet adjustments and improve credit supply.

The export-led recovery is expected to gather strength in 2014 and 2015 in line with the projected pick-up in Europe. Domestic demand will gradually recover as the labour market improves.

GDP is expected to rose 1.9% in 2014 and 2.2% in 2015.##2423|The key question regarding the first monetary policy meeting of the Federal Reserve System in the Janet Yellen era on Tuesday and Wednesday is whether the central bank will change its guidance about zero interest rates, and how.

The problem is that the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.7 percent, near the 6.5 percent threshold that the Fed set more than a year ago as the "threshold" for considering rate increases.

It's clear, however, that the economy and labor market are weaker than that headline 6.7 percent unemployment rate suggests, and that Yellen and company don't want to tighten monetary policy yet (they haven't even finished tapering the monthly bond purchases intended to add stimulus).

In recent months, the Fed's monetary policy statement has specified that it will keep rates near zero until "well past the time" when unemployment falls to 6.5 percent. With Wednesday's scheduled policy announcement, it's expected that Yellen might drop the reference to the interest rate entirely, and instead adopt a qualitative benchmark for raising rates that will more clearly spell out when the Fed might tighten. What that guidance might be, however, remains to be seen.

Congress is out of session this week, but one major legislation initiative that will spur conversation is the bill text for housing finance reform released Sunday by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and ranking member Mike Crapo, R-Idaho.

The Johnson-Crapo bill is similar in its broad outlines to another bipartisan bill introduced by members on the committee. With the support of the committee's top members, the measure could become the baseline for whenever a real legislative push is possible, likely in a subsequent Congress.

On Tuesday the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report on inflation through February with its release of the Consumer Price Index. Inflation was running at 1.6 percent year-over-year in January, according to the CPI, in both the headline number and excluding food and energy. Fed officials will be looking for inflation to tick up toward their 2 percent target. Reports on housing starts and sales and industrial production are also scheduled for this week.##2424|BEIJING: China will widen the yuan's daily trading band to two percent from the current one percent, the central bank announced Saturday, underscoring efforts to loosen Beijing's grip on its tightly-controlled currency.

The move will take effect on March 17, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its web site.

It follows a statement by the central bank last month that it was seeking an “orderly expansion” of the trading band as a policy goal.

“In order to meet the demands of market development, increase the strength of the market-determined exchange rate and establish a market-based, managed floating exchange rate regime, the People's Bank of China has decided to widen the floating range of the renminbi against the US dollar,” the bank said in its statement.

It added that the bank “will further develop the role of the market in the RMB exchange rate formulation mechanism”.

China's ruling Communist Party has maintained a firm grip on the yuan — also known as the renminbi, or RMB — as one of its key tools to control the economy, and due to worries about unpredictable financial inflows or outflows.

In widening the currency's trading band, Chinese authorities “must feel that the economy is in a strong enough position to handle an adjustment and other possible reforms ahead,” Paul Mackel, head of Asian currency research at HSBC Holdings, told Dow Jones Newswires.

The yuan has risen steadily against the dollar over the past year, but it reversed course last month to weaken around one percent — a depreciation that analysts say may have been engineered by the central bank to target speculative funds betting on continued appreciation.##2425|Empty##2426|The UK Treasury has appointed Nemat Shafik as the new Bank of England deputy governor for markets and banking as of 1 August this year.

For the second time in less than three years, Sbarro filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday.

Last month, the pizza chain said it will close 155 of its estimated 400 restaurants in North America, in a cost-cutting move. Bankruptcy court papers, quoted by Reuters, say the Melville, N.Y.-based company has between $100 million and $500 million in assets and liabilities.

But even with the closures, Sbarro would still have more than 800 outlets in over 40 countries.

The company previously filed for Chapter 11 in April of 2011, and emerged from bankruptcy in November of that year.

Related: Mt. Gox Files For U.S. Chapter 15 Bankruptcy

According to the Wall Street Journal, the company went ahead with its latest Chapter 11 filing after finding support for a debt-equity swap from its lenders. The WSJ also quotes a statement from Sbarro CEO David Karam – who described the deal as indicating the lenders' “support and confidence they have in the growth strategies" developed by Sbarro's new management team.

Karam became Sbarro's chief executive last March – replacing James Greco, who resigned after a year as CEO.

Word about Sbarro comes on the heel of reports that another fast-food chain, Quiznos, is preparing to file for bankruptcy. In a recent commentary, Fitch Ratings said both Quiznos and Sbarro “reflect the difficulties faced by brands that have lost their competitive position and relevancy with consumers.”

It also noted there was a “repeated theme” when it comes to restaurant chain bankruptcies – of companies using the Chapter 11 process to restructure or reject their operating leases in an effort to trim costs, while at the same time being protected from their creditors.

“Restaurants often take the opportunity to close unprofitable locations and typically emerge as smaller chains,” the commentary continued. “Restaurants also try to improve profitability in bankruptcy through the sale or licensing of trademarks and other intellectual property”##2429|Empty##2430|Empty##2431|Empty##2432|Empty##2433|This article originally appeared on institutionalinvestor.com on March 5, 2014.To fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and full employment, the Federal Reserve has been guided by the Taylor rule since the 1990s. The Taylor rule goes something like this: The appropriate short-term interest rate (set by the central bank) is a function of the slack in the labor market and the difference between actual inflation and the inflation target. Until the Great Recession of 2008, the unemployment rate was a good-enough indicator of the labor slack. Hence, the Fed could set interest rates simply based on core inflation and the unemployment rate. Thanks to this framework, the Fed managed to be successful on the employment front, but even more so on the price stability front.But the situation has changed recently. On one hand, inflation was painfully low in 2013; on the other, the unemployment rate has dropped sharply. Which part of the dual mandate should the Fed favor?Some observers are arguing that the drop in the unemployment rate should result in earlier rate hikes. Writers of a few Fed blogs are citing a recent study from Robert Gordon of Northwestern University. They claim that short-duration unemployment (less than 26 weeks) is the best indicator of labor slack, and that since it has already fallen below prerecession averages (see Figure 1 below), the economy is at risk of overheating.

Meanwhile, in her testimony to US Congress, freshly appointed Fed Chair Janet Yellen went in the opposite direction, saying there was probably more slack in the economy than what a naive look at the unemployment rate would indicate: "Those out of a job for more than six months continue to make up an unusually large fraction of the unemployed, and the number of people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high. These observations underscore the importance of considering more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the US labor market."Both sides have a legitimate point of view, but "Gordon versus Yellen" is a bit like "Ali versus Frazier." They're both seasoned heavyweights. That the two can have such a stark difference of opinion about the unemployment rate underscores its questionable nature as an indicator. Most likely Yellen will have the last word, but she might also have her own agenda. Would she really be concerned by a bit too much inflation due to a tighter labor market?Based on PIMCO's bottom-up analysis, our outlook for 2014 inflation has core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) moving up to 1.6% year-over-year at the end of 2014, compared with the current 1.2% rate. Longer term, it really depends on what the Fed does.Since the unemployment rate may or may not be the right measure of output slack, it's not a reliable indicator for conducting monetary policy. We'll know (with a lag) if the economy has reached the end of the cyclical downturn when inflation picks up. Hence the Fed will have to choose between being behind the curve (waiting to see inflation actually pick up) and risking a hawkish mistake.The last time it chose to ignore weak inflation prints and started to discuss monetary policy tightening, Mihir Worah and I warned that the Fed would end up doing more quantitative easing to compensate for its hawkish mistake. That same month, Chairman Bernanke announced that when "asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7%." Now the Fed is still expanding its balance sheet while the unemployment rate is well below 7%.PIMCO expects that, balancing the risks between a hawkish mistake and some inflation overshoot, Yellen will choose the latter, especially since inflation has undershot the Fed's mandate by so much in recent years. Since 2009, inflation as measured by PCE has averaged 1.4%. Given a medium-term inflation target of 2.0%, inflation could average 2.6% for the next five years to catch up. Basically, we believe Yellen could wait for core PCE to move back to a solid 2% before she hikes the rate. Since the unemployment rate is an unreliable measure, we believe inflation should guide monetary policy. But it's up to the inflation jury to decide.In the meantime, investors can position their portfolios to benefit from this monetary policy framework. Shorter-duration assets should be "safer" than longer-duration assets because they benefit from the low-for-longer policy rate stance, while longer duration will likely suffer from inflation uncertainties. We expect that strategies seeking carry from curve steepeners will perform well. The inflation premium should rise and, importantly, inflation uncertainties mean real assets should be less volatile than nominal ones.##2434|“We expect Russia to export gas to us at $368.5 per 1,000 cubic meters,” he told reporters in Kyiv on Sunday.

Ukraine continues repaying debts for gas, and there are no reasons to halt gas exports, he said.

“Gazprom has not been taking any steps of late. Our last year’s debt amounts to $1.5 billion. We managed to transfer about $100 million to Gazprom last week in repayment of our debt for January, and we have started repaying the debt for February which amounts to around $440 million,” Prodan said.

Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told the press on March 7 that Ukraine’s growing debts for Russian gas were generating a new transit crisis.

“March 7 was the deadline for February payments. Gazprom had not received any debt payments by that time. Taking the discount for the first quarter into account, the overdue debt had increased to $1.89 billion” Miller said.

“In fact, this means that Ukraine has stopped making payments for Russian gas, which is absolutely at odds with the contract and with international trade practice. We, on our part, have always honored our contract obligations and will continue doing so. But we cannot export gas for free. Ukraine will have to repay the debt and make regular payments for the current gas shipments, or face the risk of retuning to the situation that emerged at the start of 2009. We will keep the Russian government updated on the situation,” Miller said.

The early 2009 transit crisis, when Europe remained cut from Russian gas supplies for 20 days, could re-emerge for the first time over the past five years.##2435|It's quite an irony to think that the relatives and families of the passengers on board the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 become more hopeful with the hijacking theory that has been recently emerging, than discovering that the plane may have crashed.

One of the loved ones of the missing passengers has been constantly active on social media, encouraging other victims to help each other and finally find an answer to all the oddity behind such an unexpected event, LA Times reports.

Sarah Bajc, who is a 48-year-old American teacher, has 50-year-old partner Philip Wood on board the mystical plane. She recently expressed hope for other affected family members through Facebook and Twitter. "The glimmer of hope has become a definable ray. Hostages are far more valuable alive," she posted on a Facebook page campaign she made for her partner. The page is called "Finding Philip Wood."

Authorities also believe that someone may have been behind the shutting down of the messaging system of the missing Malaysia Airline Flight 370. Further investigations lead to the possibility that the person who may have been suddenly in control of the aircraft may have decided to go south, CBC states. Even Australian PM Tony Abbott has expressed their willingness to offer additional help in the search operations as he is to speak with the Malaysian authorities.

The growing search for the missing Boeing 777-200ER has expanded up to 11 other countries, and even as far as Kazakhstan according to CNN. So far, there are still a lot more of the questions than answers revealed about the missing aircraft. "I think they had an end game in mind from the very beginning," Jim Tilmon, an aviation analyst from CNN expressed.

The pilots of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are also facing utmost scrutiny by the authorities as they also start searching for their houses to potentially gain some helpful inkling. A flight simulator was discovered in the captain's home, while they were also noted interviewing the engineers of the plane before the take off. However, such are still considered part of the usual normal procedure according to the transport minister.

"Police are still working on it... Nothing conclusive yet," a senior police official shared.

The missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 carried 227 passengers, with 159 of them Chinese.##2436|© 2018 Market data provided is at least 10-minutes delayed and hosted by Barchart Solutions .

Why am I seeing this 'Under Construction' page?##2438|An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth $201 million.

The man who cobbled the deal together said Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

"No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents who he calls a "well-known billionaire."

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.

"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.

Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing United Kingdom life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.

Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based S.G. LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.

"He wants his next of kin to keep working hard," Frances said.

Frances said that the annual premium is in "the low, single digits of millions of dollars." He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.

Frances wouldn't disclose the billionaire's age.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Frances declined to discuss identity of the policyholder. Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other startups, declined to discuss with the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.##2439|Nutrition and weight loss firm Herbalife Ltd said that the US Federal Trade Commission has initiated an inquiry into the business, Reuters reported. News of the investigation, which has long been asked for by billionaire activist investor William Ackman, caused the company's share price to plummet by over 16% for a brief period.

For the past few months, Pershing Square Capital Management's Ackman has asked watchdogs to look into how Herbalife makes money. The billionaire investor alleged that Herbalife was engaged in a "pyramid scheme," a business model wherein a firm earns not by selling their products to actual clients but by getting new distributors to their team, the report said.

Los Angeles-based Herbalife said it will be working with the regulator. In a statement, the company said, "Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Since the middle of 2012, Ackman has made a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife because of his claim on the company's distribution model. However, he has so far lost money on the short since other activist investors like Carl Icahn have expressed their support for Herbalife. This week, the company said Ackman's crusade was "an unfounded, relentless and fraudulent public attack." In a March 10 statement, Herbalife defended their business model, saying, "There has never been merit to his accusations."

Meanwhile, Democrat Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts urged regulators to look into Herbalife less than a couple of months ago after his constituents told him that they had allegedly become victims of the company and lost thousands of dollars because of it. Herbalife distributors are depicted in online presentations as living luxurious lifestyles because of the success they had selling its products. However, detractors like Ackman said there is no truth to these claims, the report said.##2440|Empty##2441|Pizza chain Sbarro files for bankruptcy protection [Reuters]

It’s the ideal situation for John Koskinen. A year ago, the top White House aides Jeff Zients and Gene Sperling talked to Mr. Koskinen about a job in the Obama administration. He demurred, though he told them to call if they had something disastrous that no one else wanted to manage. They did; he says it took him “about 15 seconds” to accept the job of I.R.S. commissioner.

In IRS Scandal, Begging Is Not an Action Plan [American Thinker]

Yet the conservative response to the IRS scandal consists mainly of begging the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute and begging the IRS to start playing nice by releasing information implicating its own staff in wrongdoing and perhaps criminal violations. Like that’s gonna happen. Begging is not a plan of action. As a lawyer, the author must point out that lawyers leading conservative organizations are failing to implement the proven techniques already developed by Judicial Watch when Bill Clinton was president. The “whine and cheese party” is not the right way to achieve the results that justice demands. And all Americans are at risk from how this is being handled.

Events this week sparked plenty of commentary on the United States using its vast natural gas resources as a diplomatic weapon to soften Russia's hand.

While the United States is currently sitting on an ocean of inexpensive natural gas, exporting the fuel will not weaken Russia's resource control over Europe for three reasons. First, the U.S. government could cut all the red tape in exporting LNG, but commercial interests are not going to ship to Europe when much healthier margins are made by exporting to Asia. Even if prices skyrocketed in Europe, LNG regasification and natural gas storage is severely inadequacy. Finally, Russian natural gas is produced from conventional wells, making it the cost leader, effectively giving Russia command over market share and holding the winning hand.

The Morning Glory was intercepted in international waters off the coast of Cyprus after US President Barack Obama authorised the mission to retrieve the vessel.

US missile destroyer Roosevelt transported the Seals while also providing helicopter support.

"No one was hurt tonight when US forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans," said Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby in a statement.

"The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra," he continued.

The tanker was travelling in Mediterranean waters with the aim of selling the oil to an unnamed buyer. The US intervention was prompted by Libyan Transitional Government's potential losses in oil revenue in the event of militias selling off Libya's oil.

Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan was dismissed by parliament last week after the vessel managed to leave the eastern port of Sidra despite a naval blockade.

The As-Sidra port has been under rebel control since July 2013. Rival militia's are fighting for autonomy in Eastern Libya.

North Korean officials have said that they deregistered the vessel after the incident, rendering the ship stateless.

The number of positions waiting to be filled increased by 60,000 to 3.97 million, from a revised 3.91 million the prior month, the Labor Department said in Washington. The pace of hiring fell and fewer Americans quit their jobs.



The report follows data last week showing that February payrolls beat estimates after hiring in January was depressed by the weather. Faster hiring would help spur the wage growth needed to boost consumer spending, which accounts for almost 70 percent of the economy.



“Hiring was delayed during the winter due to bad weather, and I think we’ve started to see some catch-up already in the February figures,” said Ryan Wang, an economist at HSBC Securities USA Inc. in New York, speaking before the report. “We’ll continue to see gradual improvement in measures like quit rates and hiring rates.”



The report helps shed light on the dynamics behind monthly employment figures. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for 4.02 million job openings after a previously reported 3.99 million a month earlier.



The gain in openings indicates employers were confident about the economic expansion even as colder-than-normal weather limited hiring.



Payroll Gains



Employment rose by 175,000 in February, recovering after a lull in hiring that saw payroll gains of 129,000 in January and 84,000 in December, Labor Department figures showed last week. The jobless rate inched up to 6.7 percent last month from 6.6 percent the prior month, the lowest since 2008.



The Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, report showed the number of people hired fell to 4.54 million in January, leaving the hiring rate unchanged at 3.3 percent.



Some 2.38 million people quit their jobs in January, down from the prior month’s 2.42 million tally. The quits rate, which shows how willing workers are to leave their jobs, declined to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent.



The JOLTS report is among data monitored by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. It also made an appearance in the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting ended Jan. 29.



Fed Minutes



“Overall, labor market indicators appeared consistent with a gradual ongoing improvement in labor market conditions,” the minutes state. “Among other indicators of labor market conditions, the rate of job openings edged up in recent months.”



The report also showed total firings, which exclude retirements and those who left their job voluntarily, increased to 1.74 million in January from 1.7 million a month before.



Job openings in the health-care, education and leisure and hospitality fields were among those accounting for the biggest increases in available employment, while the retail and trade, transportation and utilities industries showed declines.



In the 12 months ended in January, the economy created a net 2.2 million jobs, representing 54.3 million hires and 52.1 million separations.



Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s Cos. is among companies with plans to add staff, setting the stage for further gains in employment as Americans return to stores once temperatures turn more seasonable. The company said Feb. 19 that it will be adding about 25,000 seasonal employees this year for the industry’s busiest season.



Meanwhile, companies including Staples Inc., the largest U.S. office-supplies chain, are among those likely to lay off workers. The Framingham, Massachusetts-based company will close as many as 12 percent of its North American stores as online competition hurts sales, it said March 6.

WASHINGTON (CBSDC/AP) — Former Vice President Dick Cheney says President Barack Obama is looking weak among global leaders as the Ukraine crisis continues to unfold.

Speaking to CBS News’ “Face the Nation” Sunday, Cheney stated that the president “hasn’t gotten any credibility with our allies.”

“We have created an image around the world not just for the Russians, of weakness, of indecisiveness,” Cheney said.

The former VP under President George W. Bush said European Parliament members have told him it’s hard to back sanctions Obama is laying out for Russia after his handling of Syria last year.

Cheney also called for Obama to reinstate the proposed Bush-era missile defense program in Poland and the Czech Republic that the president ended up scrapping in 2009. Ten ground-based interceptors would have been placed in Poland while a radar would’ve been placed inside the Czech Republic.

“My answer is reinstate the ballistic missile defense program and policy. [Russian President Vladimir Putin] cares a lot about that,” Cheney told “Face the Nation.” “Conduct joint military exercises with our NATO friends close to the Russian border. Offer up equipment and training to the Ukrainian military.”

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday warned Secretary of State John Kerry that U.S. sanctions could “backfire,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. During a telephone call, Lavrov urged the U.S. not to take “hasty, poorly thought-out steps that could harm Russian-U.S. relations, especially concerning sanctions, which would unavoidably boomerang on the U.S. itself,” the statement said.

In a separate statement on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry also warned the European Union that any sanctions it imposed would not go unanswered and would harm “the interests of the EU itself and its member nations.”

Kerry underscored to Lavrov the importance of finding a constructive way to resolve the situation diplomatically, which would address the interests of the people of Ukraine, Russia, and the international community. Kerry and Lavrov agreed to continue to consult in the days ahead, according to the State Department.

Declaring his determination not to let the Kremlin carve up Ukraine, Obama on Thursday slapped new visa restrictions on Russian and other opponents of Ukraine’s government in Kiev and authorized wider financial penalties against those involved in the military intervention or in stealing state assets. Obama emphasized his resolve in an hourlong telephone call with Putin, affirming his contention that Russia’s actions violate Ukraine’s sovereignty.

Showing greater caution than Obama on sanctions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said European penalties against Russia depend “on how the diplomatic process progresses.” EU President Herman Van Rompuy said travel bans, asset freezes and the cancellation of an EU-Russia summit could still come. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk acknowledged “no enthusiasm” in Europe for economic sanctions.

In some ways, the debate over sanctions echoes the Cold War doctrine of military strategy in which if two opponents fired off nuclear weapons, both sides would be annihilated.

“There is a kind of mutually assured destruction relationship here,” said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and analyst at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. “Russia could say, ‘Well, we’re going to cut off your gas, and you guys can now scramble and buy extra gas and pay big prices.’

“It would hurt the Europeans, but it also would cut off the biggest source of cash that flows into Russia today,” he said referring to oil and gas sales that account for about 60 percent of Russia’s exports and half of its government revenue. “So the Russians may threaten some things, but they also have to consider that if they do that what it would do to the Russian economy.”

The State Department sought to allay fears that Europe might find itself short on Russian gas.

“We understand that European gas inventories are well-above normal levels, due to a milder than usual winter, and could replace a loss of Russian exports for several months, if necessary,” spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. “Naturally, we take the energy security of our friends very seriously.”

Ariel Cohen, an expert on Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said he doesn’t know whether the Europeans would be willing to impose tough sanctions, particularly against Russia’s banking and financial systems. Even if the Europeans don’t, the U.S. needs to take the lead or risk allowing Russia to alter current world order, he said.

“Either we take a lead or the international system goes back to the chaos and high-risk levels that existed before World War I and between World War I and World War II,” he said. “This is very serious. I cannot emphasize that enough. People who talk about ‘Oh, we won’t get cheap gas from Russia’ or ‘The Russians will get angry’ — they do not look at it beyond the current geopolitical and international order.”

If Russia grabs Crimea, Iran would be less willing to give up an ability to develop nuclear arms. “The message to Iran would be: If you have nuclear weapons you will not be attacked, your regime will be intact. If you don’t have nuclear weapons, your regime can be toppled and pieces of your territory can be taken away.”

Bank Clothiers ended amicably Tuesday with the former agreeing to buy the latter for $65 per share or about $1.8 billion in cash.

The boards of both suit retailers have unanimously approved the transaction.

Together, Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have more than 1,700 U.S. stores and about 23,000 employees. It says it will be the the fourth-largest U.S. men’s clothing retailer, with $3.5 billion in sales.

The battle started in October, when Jos. A. Bank launched a surprise bid to acquire Fremont-based Men’s Wearhouse for $48 a share, or $2.3 billion.

That was just a few months after the Men’s Wearhouse board ousted its founder and TV pitchman George “I guarantee it” Zimmer as chairman on the morning of its annual meeting, which was abruptly called off.

Men’s Wearhouse rejected the offer and in mid-November, offered $1.5 billion to buy Jos. A Bank. That deal culminated in Wednesday’s joint announcement.

“We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Jos. A. Bank, which we believe will deliver substantial benefits to our respective shareholders, employees and customers,” Doug Ewert, Men’s Wearhouse president and chief executive said in a press release.



“We look forward to working together with Men’s Wearhouse to ensure a smooth transition,” Jos. A Bank chairman Robert Wildrick said.

The takeover battle has been good for both companies’ shareholders. The purchase price represents a 65 percent premium over Bank’s closing stock price on Oct. 8, the day before it launched its offer. Men’s Wearhouse has also risen about 65 percent during the same period.

As part of the deal, Jos. A. Bank has ended its agreement to acquire the parent company of Eddie Bauer and to repurchase up to $300 million of its stock, both seen as defensive moves.

Men’s Wearhouse will pay for its competitor with cash and debt financing from BofA Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase Bank.

Zimmer and his college roommates opened the first Men’s Wearhouse store in Houston in 1973. In 1981, with 12 stores in Texas, Zimmer came to San Francisco to open a second market in the Bay Area. He fell in love with the weather and setting, and ended up moving himself and much of the company to the East Bay. Zimmer no longer appears in the company’s advertising but does make an appearance on its Web site.

Although the company sometimes lists its headquarters as Houston, a spokesman said it is Fremont. It operates 1,124 stores.

Jos. A. Bank was founded in 1905 and is headquartered in Hampstead, Md. It has 629 stores. Unlike Men’s Wearhouse, which carries a variety of manufacturers including a private-label brand, Jos. A. Bank only offers its own line of clothing.

Although both firms target value-conscious customers, Jos. A. Bank’s tend to be higher income. Men’s Wearhouse customers tend to skew younger — into their 20s — because it has a tuxedo-rental program that caters to the prom and wedding crowd, says Betty Chen, an analyst with Mizuho Securities.

Men’s Wearhouse declined to comment on the merger beyond its press release. It said the company expects to save $100 to $150 million over three years, “through improving purchasing efficiencies, optimizing customer service and marketing practices, and streamlining duplicative corporate functions.” It also said there will be “no rebranding or remodels required.”

It did not say whether there will be any store closures. A spokesman for Jos. A, Bank said “there is some overlap,” but “Men’s Wearhouse trends more toward the south and west, whereas Jos. A. Bank trends more to the north and east.”

The transaction is expected to close by the third quarter of 2014, subject to regulatory approval.##2453|Empty##2454|By

The recalls stem from two unrelated problems, and Chrysler knows of no accidents or injuries associated with either flaw.

2012-2013 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE & DODGE DURANGO

According to a press release from Chrysler, the Grand Cherokee/Durango recall is meant to address "pedal feel" on the vehicles' brakes. The automaker was contacted by a parts supplier, which believed that one of its components might be interfering with Chrysler's Ready Alert Braking system. That system "primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop".

Upon investigation, Chrysler found that brake fluid in the Grand Cherokee and Durango was, in fact, being restricted, which caused diminished brake pedal feel. However, the company points out that "Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation" as a result of the problem.

The flaw affects some 25,250 vehicles -- 18,700 purchased in the U.S., 825 in Canada, 530 in Mexico, and the remaining 5,200 located in other countries.

Chrysler hasn't issued a timeline for fixing the problem, but says that it will let owners know when they can take their vehicles to Chrysler dealers for free repairs. If you own one of the affected vehicles and have additional questions, you're encouraged to contact Chrysler directly at 800-853-1403.

2014 FIAT 500L

The Fiat 500L, on the other hand, is being recalled for a glitch in its transmission software. According to a press release:

Chrysler Group engineers launched an investigation after reviewing reports that some vehicles equipped with dual dry clutch automatic transmissions would not shift readily out of park and/or their transmissions did not receive, or were slow to receive, an intended gear selection.

The problem has been linked to a microcontroller associated with the transmission -- a component that Chrysler says might be "compromised" by extremes in temperature. That sounds like a mechanical problem, but the fix comes in the form of a software update (though Chrysler says that 200 of the recalled vehicles may require replacement of the shift-module to ensure compatibility with the new software).

All told, the Fiat recall affects around 19,500 vehicles, at least 20 percent of which are still on dealer lots. Approximately 18,100 of the recalled vehicles are located in the U.S., with the remaining 1,400 in Canada.

As with the Grand Cherokee and Durango recall, Chrysler hasn't indicated when it will begin notifying owners of the Fiat 500L recall. However, when it does, owners will be able to take their vehicles to Fiat dealers, who will fix them free of charge. For additional information, contact Chrysler at 800-853-1403.

The combined company will be called ChiquitaFyffes Plc, Chiquita and Fyffes said today in a joint statement. The all- stock offer represents a bid premium of 35 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Shares of Chiquita and Fyffes rose.

The deal brings together two of the world’s oldest fruit importers, who between them have operations spanning the Americas, Europe and Asia. Chiquita Chief Executive Officer Ed Lonergan, who will become chairman of ChiquitaFyffes, has sought to reshape his Charlotte, North Carolina-based company as a high-volume seller of bananas and salads while winding down and abandoning other product lines.

“The deal is logical and will be a good fit going forward for both parties,” said David Holohan, an analyst at Merrion Capital in Dublin. “This is an excellent result for Fyffes.”

Investors will get 0.1567 of a share in ChiquitaFyffes for each Fyffes share, while Chiquita holders will receive one share in the new company for each one of the existing company.

Fyffes Chairman David McCann will become CEO of the combined company, which will be domiciled in Ireland, trade in New York and have annual sales of about $4.6 billion. The transaction is expected to close this year, pending approval by shareholders and the Irish High Court.

Minimal Overlap

Chiquita investors will own about 50.7 percent of the combined entity, with Fyffes shareholders holding the remainder. As well as bananas, ChiquitaFyffes will supply melons, pineapples and packaged salads. The new business will target at least $40 million of annual cost savings by the end of 2016 through more efficient purchasing.

Fyffes shares rose 45 percent to 1.29 euros at 3:21 p.m. in Dublin. Chiquita climbed 12 percent to $12.15 in New York.

Lonergan, who will become chairman of ChiquitaFyffes, said today on a conference call that he doesn’t think there will be any regulatory issues arising from the deal that can’t be addressed.

He also said there’s minimal overlap of both companies geographically. Chiquita operates in 70 countries including the U.S., with brands such as Chiquita Bananas and Fresh Express. Fyffes operates in Europe, Central and South America, and Asia.

Conference Meeting

Chiquita started more than 140 years ago when Captain Lorenzo Dow Barker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica, sailed to Jersey City in 11 days and sold them for a profit. The company is still incorporated in New Jersey, according to corporate filings.

Fyffes says it has distributed the fruit since the 19th century, when it made a shipment to London from the Canary Islands.

McCann and his family have led Fyffes since the 1950s when his father Neil joined the business, according to company statements.

Lonergan first suggested the deal when he met the Fyffes Chairman at a fruit conference in New Orleans in October, McCann said in today in an interview.

“Between us, we can provide any type of banana that a retailer wants,” Lonergan said in the same interview.

Balkan Investment Co., an entity run by the McCanns, controls about 13 percent of Fyffes and intends to vote for the deal. The Jerry Zucker Revocable Trust, which controls about 13 percent of Fyffes, also has committed to backing the merger. Other shareholders include Fidelity Investment funds, which control about 20 percent.

The biggest holders in Chiquita include Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc., who control almost 20 percent combined.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is acting as lead financial adviser to Chiquita, and Wells Fargo Securities LLC as financial adviser to the Chiquita board of directors. Lazard Ltd. is lead financial adviser to Fyffes.##2463|Jennifer Hewett By

The problem with Labor's argument to extend the banking royal commission is that Kenneth Hayne hasn't asked for more time - and the opposition's decision to hold its own hearings looks far too much like the stunt it is.##2464|House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), seen here in October 2013, joined with Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) to form a 30-member working group to address the health-care law. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)

House Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation’s health-care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.

The tenets of the plan — which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations — are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.

But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with lawmakers outlining the plan, called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,” with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents.

“We’ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in an interview. “We’ve got all of these bills out there, so we’re going to take this core of policies and grow from there.”

Republicans have campaigned heavily on their opposition to the health-care law in this year’s congressional elections, betting that anger with the law will propel them to gain seats in the House and take control of the Senate. Those efforts accelerated last week after Republican David Jolly’s upset victory in a special House election in Florida in which the campaigns focused on the law.

In meetings with Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) last week, House leadership allies cast Florida as a sign of good things to come in November. But they also cautioned that Republicans needed to offer a clearer alternative.

“It’s going to be all about giving people a choice,” said Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), an anesthesiologist.

Democrats dismissed the Republican approach as a purely political gesture ahead of this year’s midterm elections, saying the focus on long-held conservative ideas was more of an attempt to rally Republicans than to find bipartisan solutions.

“If they had fixes, I’d certainly consider it,” Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) said. “But if they are trying to scrap it all, going back to the bad old days, it’s not going to go anywhere.”

A CNN-ORC International survey released Tuesday showed support for the Affordable Care Act ticking up slightly, with 39 percent of Americans saying they support the health-care law, an increase from 35 percent in December. Fifty-seven percent of those polled oppose the law, down from 62 percent in December.

The Republicans’ plan is hardly intended as a full replacement of the federal health-care law — and that is by design. They would prefer to see a shift away from the federal government and to the states, with an emphasis on getting more consumers on private plans.

As they finalize their alternative, House Republicans are continuing their years-long effort to take a legislative hammer to the law, passing a bill Friday that would delay the individual mandate and repeal Medicare’s sustainable-growth rate.

For the most part, House Democrats are not taking the bait. Outside the House chamber Thursday, Rep. Ron Barber (Ariz.), a Tucson area Democrat facing a difficult reelection race, said that he would like to “make some amendments and adjustments” to the health-care law but added that “the bill is the law and not going anywhere.”

At a news conference Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said Democrats would not run away from the law and shrugged off talk that Florida could be a harbinger of looming Democratic losses in the House and Senate.

“I’m very proud of our House Democrats and how they have not only embraced the Affordable Care Act, because they helped create it, but how proud they are of it,” she said. “I think the Republicans are wasting their time using that as their electoral issue, and they will find that out.”

McCarthy, along with Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, formed a 30-member working group, dubbed the House Obamacare Accountability Project, in May, vetting suggestions over long lunches and reporting back to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). The group has met once every two weeks, usually in McCarthy’s spacious Capitol suite.

“The first priority was establishing trust, and then we moved forward,” McMorris Rodgers said. “We’ve touched every part of the philosophical range.”

The policies on the group’s radar have a conservative streak, and the academics and analysts consulted during early deliberations were largely drawn from conservative think tanks, with talks by James Capretta, a former official in the George W. Bush administration; Avik Roy, a writer for National Review; and Dennis Smith, a former adviser to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R).

Conservative leaders in the House, such as Rep. Tom Price (Ga.), a physician from the Atlanta suburbs, and Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, have also played critical roles. Their involvement has enabled the leadership to avoid complaints from the right flank — and ensured that Republicans would not veer from conservative doctrine.

But some conservatives are wary of the push to have House Republicans sing as a unified chorus. At Wednesday’s Weyrich Lunch on Capitol Hill, a gathering of hard-right operatives named after the late conservative strategist Paul Weyrich, there was much skepticism about the leadership’s strategy, with conservatives urging their allies to be cautious.

McMorris Rodgers, who gave the party’s official response to Obama’s State of the Union address in January, played down tensions, saying the early outline is a blend of four previous GOP bills: a replacement plan produced by the Republican Study Committee, a bill authored by Price, a Senate Republican proposal, and the House GOP’s 2009 alternative to the Affordable Care Act.

Next month, when the House breaks for its April recess, McMorris Rodgers will provide members with a PowerPoint presentation on the GOP plan and will later hold sessions to collect feedback on how the recommendations went over at town hall meetings. Publicizing stories of people who have seen premium increases is a priority.

“It’s not enough to say, ‘I told you so,’ ” McCarthy said. “The country has changed since Obamacare has come in — we understand that. But we’re going to offer specific ideas, making the big-picture case and on the micro level.”

A complete health-care overhaul remains the GOP’s overarching goal. GOP leaders, however, are open to adopting conservative versions of elements of the law. Regarding people with preexisting conditions, for instance, they point to the high-risk insurance pools, which would be managed and subsidized by states. On allowing children to stay on their parents’ health insurance plans until age 26, they said Republicans may back that policy.

Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are closely watching the House GOP’s activity. This year, Sens. Tom Coburn (Okla.), Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) and Richard Burr (N.C.) proposed their own alternative, which they suggested could be the basis for the party-wide pitch on health care.

“There are only so many answers — that’s the thing,” Coburn said. “I don’t care about the politics of it. I want to solve the problem. Eventually we’re going to have to roll up our sleeves and have some kind of combined message.”##2465|Empty##2466|The city of Los Angeles is suing Time Warner Cable for allegedly cheating on its franchise fees to the city, according to a lawsuit filed Friday.

The city is seeking $9.7 million in payments after Time Warner Cable “blatantly refused to live up to its obligations to the city” said the suit, even as the company received $500 million a year from customers in the city for providing cable network services, the LA Times reports.

The suit claims that Time Warner Cable owed $2.5 million in franchise fees and public, education and governmental channel fees in 2008 and 2009, and $7.2 million in 2010 and 2011.

Time Warner Cable denied the allegations, calling them “without merit.”

The city charges cable companies franchise fees that amount to 5% of a cable operators’ revenues, instead of charging rent for the public right-of-way to install and maintain the company’s wires and cable boxes.

She hasn’t highlighted one labor indicator that economists say is sounding inflation alarms: short-term unemployment.

With total joblessness at 6.7 percent in February, still higher than the Fed wants, the rate for those who have been out of work less than 27 weeks was just 4.2 percent. That’s near the lowest since April 2008 and 0.6 percentage point below the average since 1948, Labor Department data show.

The depressed level suggests the labor market is tightening, raising the odds that a pick-up in wages will eventually lead to faster inflation, according to economists including Michelle Girard of RBS Securities. That’s important because Fed policy makers have cited a slack job market and subdued inflation as reasons for keeping short-term interest rates near zero even as the economy picks up.

‘‘If the Fed is wrong and the labor market is tighter, firms are going to have to start at some point paying more,’’ said Girard, chief US economist for RBS in Stamford, Conn. ‘‘Some of the Fed’s comfort level — ‘We can just sit with these easy money policies without any worries about future inflation’ — might be called into question.’’

Girard and fellow economists Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase and Peter Hooper of Deutsche Bank Securities, both in New York, argue the short-term unemployment rate provides a more accurate picture of tightness in the labor market.

That leaves aside those who have been without a job for more than 26 weeks, a group that represented 37 percent of the unemployed in February, compared with 16 percent in the 20 years before the start of the last recession.

When people are out of work for so long, they tend to become less active in seeking a job, and employers consider them less suitable for hiring, according to studies by researchers at Princeton University, Columbia University, and the Boston Fed.

The implication is that large numbers of long-term unemployed don’t exert much downward pressure on wages. What counts, according to Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro Research in New York, is how many people are looking for work after having been jobless for only a few weeks or months. When their numbers dwindle, employers may have to offer higher wages to fill vacancies.

Investors are starting to pay attention. More than $350 million flowed into inflation-protected bond funds in the week ended March 5, the most since May 2012, according to data from Cambridge, Mass.-based EPFR Global. The increase followed eight straight weekly declines.

‘‘The overall cultural attitude among investors’’ may be shifting from deflation worries to concerns ‘‘about the likelihood of emerging inflationary pressures,’’ James Paulsen, the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management Inc., wrote in a March 11 note to clients.

Yellen, Fed chairwoman, and her colleagues will review the Fed’s monetary strategy when they meet on March 18-19. After their last gathering in January, they said they expected to hold rates near zero ‘‘well past the time’’ total unemployment falls below 6.5 percent, especially if inflation is forecast to continue to run below the Fed’s 2 percent target. Inflation was 1.2 percent in January.

Yellen, 67, told the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 27 that the Fed is moving in the direction of providing investors with qualitative guidance on its interest-rate intentions now that unemployment is closing in on the 6.5 percent marker.

The Fed chairwoman suggested that the jobless rate, if anything, may understate how loose the labor market is. She pointed to the large number of people working part-time who would prefer more hours. Some 7.2 million Americans faced that predicament in February, well above the 20-year average of 5.3 million, according to seasonally adjusted Labor Department data.

In a speech last year, Yellen pointed to a number of other indicators of labor market slack, including the share of the working-age population in the labor force and the hiring rate by employers.

While Yellen hasn’t drawn attention to short-term joblessness as a key indicator, some of her Fed colleagues have.

John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said on Feb. 19 that the drop in short-term unemployment may cause inflation to pick up more quickly than the gradual increase he currently envisions. ‘‘It could be that slack in labor markets is much less than assumed,’’ he told a meeting in New York. ‘‘I currently see this as a risk to the inflation outlook.’’

New York Fed economists M. Henry Linder, Richard Peach, and Robert Rich also highlighted the importance of short-duration unemployment in a Feb. 12 note, concluding that it has done ‘‘a better job’’ tracking changes in worker compensation than the overall jobless rate. New York Fed president William C. Dudley, though, played down their results, saying the research was ‘‘probably a little bit too black and white.’’##2470|Empty##2471|French telecoms-to-construction conglomerate Bouygues has upped the cash component of its offer for Vivendi-owned SFR by EUR800 million to EUR11.3 billion, increasing the valuation it places on the company to about EUR15.5 billion.

This is after minutes of meetings from 2006 were published last Wednesday following a Freedom of Information request. The records show that a senior member of the Bank of England’s staff was told of “attempts to move the market”.

The Bank said that there was no evidence to prove the allegations. However, one member of staff has been suspended over compliance concerns.

Committee member Andrea Leadsom said that Carney would be questioned on whether the bank “did nothing” about forex rigging suspicions.

“It looks to me that the bank could be accused either of complacency or extreme naivety,” the Conservative MP for South Northamptonshire told the BBC.

“What we need to know is that they themselves are sufficiently governed,” she said.

Now read:##2474|Empty##2475|A new search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean as authorities try to determine what happened to a missing Malaysian airliner, the White House said tonight.

“It’s my understanding that based on some new information that‘s not necessarily conclusive - but new information - an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean,“ White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

“And we are consulting with international partners about the appropriate assets to deploy.“

Mr Carney did not specify the nature of the “new information.“

Mr Carney sidestepped a question as to whether the United States has confidence in the investigation being conducted by the Malaysian government.

“I just don‘t have an evaluation to make,“ he said. “What I can tell you is that we‘re working with the Malaysian government to try to find the plane; find out what happened to it for the sake of the families and, obviously, for the sake of knowing what caused the plane to disappear.“

The United States has been helping in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, including the deployment of US Navy vessels. It also has sent transportation safety board and federal aviation administration officials there.

“There are a number of possible scenarios that are being investigated as to what happened to the flight. And we are not in a position at this time to make conclusions about what happened, unfortunately. But we’re actively participating in the search,” Mr Carney told a regular news briefing.

“We‘re looking at information, pursuing possible leads, working within the investigation being led by the Malaysian government.“

US defence officials told Reuters the guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd was en route to Strait of Malacca, west of the Malaysian peninsula, to continue the search for the missing jetliner, answering a request from the Malaysian government. The officials said they were unaware of any new evidence indicating where the plane might have crashed.

The Kidd had been searching the areas south of the Gulf of Thailand, along with the destroyer USS Pinckney. A US defence official noted that a Navy P-3 Orion aircraft had already searched the Strait of Malacca.

Earlier today, Malaysian authorities expanded their search for the missing Boeing 777 jet into the Andaman Sea and beyond after acknowledging it could have flown for several more hours after its last contact with the ground.

That scenario would make finding the plane a vastly more difficult task, and raises the possibility that searchers are currently looking in the wrong place for the aircraft and its 229 passengers and crew.

In the latest in a series of false leads, planes were sent to search an area where Chinese satellite images published on a Chinese government website reportedly showed three suspected floating objects off the southern tip of Vietnam.

“There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing,” said acting Malaysian transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein.

Compounding the frustration, he later said the Chinese Embassy had notified the government that the images were released by mistake and did not show any debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370.

The plane was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing early on Saturday when it lost contact with ground controllers and civilian radar.

An international search effort is sweeping the South China Sea and also the Strait of Malacca because of unconfirmed military radar sightings that might indicate the plane changed course and headed west after its last contact.

The Wall Street Journal newspaper quoted US investigators as saying they suspected the plane remained in the air for about four hours after its last confirmed contact, citing data from the plane’s engines that are automatically transmitted to the ground as part of a routine maintenance programme.

Mr Hishammuddin said the government had contacted Boeing and Rolls-Royce, the engine manufacturer, and both said the last data was received at 1.07am — around 23 minutes before the plane lost contact.

But asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Mr Hishammuddin said: “Of course, we can’t rule anything out. This is why we have extended the search.”

He said the search had been widened into the Andaman Sea, and Malaysia is asking for radar data from neighbouring countries. India plans to deploy air and sea assets in the southern section of the sea to join the search.

Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the disappearance of the plane.

Experts say a massive failure knocking out its electrical systems, while unlikely, could explain why its transponders, which identify it to civilian radar systems and other planes nearby, were not working.

Another possibility is that the pilot, or a passenger, likely one with some technical knowledge, switched off the transponders in the hope of flying undetected.

The jet had enough fuel to reach deep into the Indian Ocean.

Dozens of ships and aircraft from 12 nations have been searching the Gulf of Thailand and the strait, but no confirmed trace has been found.

The search area is about the size of Portugal.

Experts say that if the plane crashed into the ocean then some debris should be floating on the surface, even if most of the jet is submerged. Past experience shows that finding the wreckage can take weeks or even longer, especially if the location of the plane is in doubt.

Malaysia’s air force chief said yesterday that an unidentified object appeared on military radar records about 322km north-west of Penang, Malaysia, and experts are analysing the data in an attempt to determine whether the blip is the missing plane.

Sweeping changes are on the way at the top of the Bank of England, with the IMF’s Nemat “Minouche” Shafik hired as deputy governor for markets and banking, and MPC member Ben Broadbent promoted the deputy governor for monetary policy.

The changes this summer will also lead to Andy Haldane becoming chief economist, and markets boss Paul Fisher getting a new position at the Bank.

Dr Shafik is experienced across international policy and market operations – she led the IMF’s bailouts of Greece and Portugal for instance – but is something of an unknown quantity in monetary policy terms.

Her recent speeches drop a few hints at what stance we can expect her to take on the MPC. Dr Shafik has called for central banks to renew their focus on fighting inflation, suggesting she could be relatively hawkish.

“I think we all agree that inflation is the most regressive tax, and that the poor are best served by a central bank that can deliver clear and credible, low and stable inflation. Inflation doesn’t have to be the only objective of the central bank,” she said in January at a Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning event in New Delhi.

“Central banks can have other objectives, such as employment or growth. But again the one thing that is really important is that we are clear about what we are asking the central bank to deliver.”

But she is enthusiastically on board with the trend for more verbal guidance to markets from central bankers.

“One of the most important tools of central bankers is communications—what we now call open mouth operations,” she said last March.

“Central banks often don't have to buy anything to move markets—they just have to say something.”

Other changes at the top of the Bank include the hawkish chief economist Spencer Dale leaving the MPC to become executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, on the Financial Policy Committee (FPC).

His role on the monetary policy committee (MPC) will be taken by the free thinking financial stability boss Andy Haldane, who moves off the FPC and become chief economist.

Meanwhile Ben Broadbent is taking the job of deputy governor from the retiring Charlie Bean.

And Paul Fisher is leaving the MPC, as his position as executive director for markets is taken over by Shafik.

However, Fisher is not expected to leave the Bank – it is thought he is getting a major new post when Mark Carney tonight announces the fuller shakeup of the Bank’s structure and strategy.

Meanwhile Anthony Habgood will take over as chair of the court of the Bank of England, replacing Sir David Lees and taking responsibility for governance and overviewing strategy.##2478|FILE - In this Friday, Feb. 21, 2014, file photo, trader Gregory Rowe, center, works at the post of specialist Joseph Mastrolia, left, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

Stocks drifted to a slightly lower finish Monday as investors sifted through a blend of discouraging economic data from China and Japan as well as ongoing uncertainty over Russia's incursion into Ukraine.

Major market indexes pared their losses as the day drew to a close, aided by some high-flying stocks, including Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Chiquita Brands International and Southwest Airlines.

In the absence of U.S. economic data, investors focused on news that China's exports slumped 18 percent in February. The report reinforced fears about the outlook for the world's second-largest economy.

In addition, Japan reported a record current account deficit for January and lowered its economic growth estimate for the October-December quarter to 0.7 percent from 1 percent.

The reports made for a downbeat start for the market as investors seized the moment to recalibrate their stock holdings.

"It was a little bit of an excuse to take some money off the table," said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. "We have geopolitical uncertainty, so (it's) a good excuse to re-evaluate your risk exposure. It's going to be par for the course for this year."

The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged down 0.87 of a point to close at 1,877.17. It had been down 11 points earlier.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418.68. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.77 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.45.

The three major U.S. indexes are still up for the month, and only the Dow is down for the year. The S&P 500 ended Monday up 1.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq finished up 3.8 percent.

The downbeat economic report from China hurt several industry sectors heavily reliant on Chinese economic growth, in particular, materials, energy and industrials. Six of the 10 sectors of the S&P 500 index ended lower, led by industrials. Mining company Cliffs Natural Resources was among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500, shedding 70 cents, or 3.8 percent to $17.95.

"The market is growing more pessimistic around growth in China," said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management.

Despite the disappointing data, some market watchers anticipate that last week's gains will continue.

The S&P 500 index notched record highs three times last week as investors grew more confident that weak U.S. economic reports in recent weeks were a reflection of the severe winter, not a broad economic slowdown. Better-than-expected payroll numbers last week also encouraged investors.##2479|March 10, 2014 2 min read

Chiquita and Irish fruit firm Fyffes agreed to merge Monday, forming the world's largest banana company.

The $1.07 billion all-stock deal would result in the creation of ChiquitaFyffes, a company expected to sell about 160 million boxes of bananas annually, ousting No. 1 banana supplier Dole Food Co. from the top spot. The new company would have 32,000 employees and $4.6 billion in annual revenue from sales.

"Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth," said Fyffes Executive Chairman David McCann in a statement. "We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers."

The merged company will be listed in New York but domiciled in Ireland, a move that will result in tax savings for the company. Chiquita shareholders will own approximately 50.7 percent of ChiquitaFyffes.

Both Chiquita and Fyffes have historic backgrounds in the banana market. Chiquita, founded in 1870, was one of the first companies to market branded bananas and helped the fruit gain popularity in the U.S. following World War II. Fyffes, which began shipping bananas in 1888, claims to be the world's oldest fruit brand as it started sticking blue labels on all its produce in 1929.

The modern banana market is at a point of flux, as new innovations and challenges transform the industry. Recent improvements in shipping technology has allowed bananas' life span to more than double, with exports of bananas increasing by 7.3 percent in 2012 to an all-time high of 16.5 million tons. At the same time, new fungi may threaten the global industry as we know it.

Related: Inventor of the Cronut Reveals His Latest Creation##2480|It is all change at the Bank of England. The new appointments were formally announced by George Osborne but show the governor, Mark Carney, stamping his authority all over Threadneedle Street.

Before moving on to the winners and losers, it is worth commenting on the rationale behind the need for a deputy governor for markets and banking. Quite simply, the extra work load heaped on the Bank in the aftermath of the financial crisis means that there is a risk of Carney being asked to do too much: monetary policy, strategic oversight of the City, keeping an eye on individual banks and ensuring the financial markets work smoothly and honestly.

The governor remains ultimately responsible for all these tasks, but can now delegate some of the responsibility to four deputies. Ben Broadbent gets monetary policy; the former Treasury mandarin John Cunliffe looks after financial stability; Andrew Bailey takes care of prudential regulation of the banks; Nemat Shafik takes up the new post of deputy governor for markets and banking.

There are two key parts of Shafik's role. Firstly, to ensure that the markets are cleaned up after the scandals involving Libor and foreign exchange traders. The Bank's own involvement in these affairs is currently under scrutiny, and the appointment of a high-profile outsider – Shafik's role at the IMF makes her Britain's most senior official in an international body – shows Carney's concern about the potential damage the scandals are doing to Threadneedle Street's image.

The second, perhaps even more daunting, task for Shafik is to work out a way of unwinding the Bank's quantitative easing programme. This is the initiative that pumped money into the banking system through the purchase of £375bn in government bonds. Buying the bonds has helped suppress long-term interest rates; the task for the new deputy governor is to devise a means of selling them back to the markets without jeopardising economic growth.

Two other things about the new structure are worthy of mention. Broadbent's move from being an external member of the MPC to a full-time Bank official adds to the sense that Goldman Sachs runs the world. Both Carney and Broadbent have worked at Goldmans. Secondly, Shafik's appointment does something to remedy the gender imbalance at the Bank.

As for the personnel changes, Paul Fisher, the executive director for markets, has carried the can for the Libor and forex scandals. He loses his place on the MPC. Spencer Dale, currently chief economist, was a candidate to replace Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy but lost out to Broadbent. Dale appears to have paid the price for the Bank's less than stellar record for economic forecasting and does a job swap with Andy Haldane, executive director for financial stability.

What do the changes add up to? Clearly, the Bank's organisational structure needed to be updated to take account of the fact that it is no longer simply an institution that does monetary policy. That re-organisation is now in place. All the coming and going means there will be a vacancy for an external member of the MPC. It is unlikely, however, that the public will notice much of a change to monetary policy; although Shafik's views are unknown the balance of hawks and doves remains unchanged.

Finally, the appointment of Shafik is bound to prompt speculation that she will become the Bank's first female governor when Carney's term ends in the summer of 2018.##2481|Vodafone has agreed to acquire Spanish broadband, phone and TV provider Ono in a deal worth £6 billion.

On Friday, the Central District of California filed a complaint at the United States District Court.

Mike Feuer, the city attorney, filed the case stating that Time Warner Cable was evading payment of franchise fees in the range of $9.7 million, including $7.9 million and $2.51 million as franchise dues for 2010-2011 and other unpaid dues respectively.

The complaint filed in the court clearly mentions that Times Warner Cable has amassed a huge amount of money as a cable television franchise in this region, but they adamantly overrode the stipulated guidelines and failed to pay their rightly dues to the city administration for the privileges offered to them.

The complaint also states that this cable operating franchise was able to generate revenue to the tune of $1 billion in 24 months from the city of Los Angeles alone. At a press conference in City Hall to announce the law suit, Mike Feuer said that Time Warner owed the taxpayers in Los Angeles millions of dollars in terms of unpaid dues and that the city will not let it go on further.

The city attorney mentioned that they have been negotiating with the Times Warner cable franchise for years to pay up their dues, but their vehement refusal left them with no choice but to take them to the court.

Feuer also went on to say that the money that this cable franchise owes the city of Los Angeles would have been used either to repair the sidewalks or to recruit close to 100 police officers. In response to this complaint, Times Warner refuted these charges and highlighted that the company is a responsible and active corporate citizen.##2483|This article was written by Oilprice.com -- the leading provider of energy news in the world.

Gazprom (NASDAQOTH:OGZPY) stated on March 7 that Ukraine has failed to pay for its natural gas deliveries in February. The failure to pay, the Russian gas giant notes, may result in a disruption in service. Gazprom went to lengths to reassure the world that it would continue to ship gas to Europe regardless of the Ukrainian conflict. "There are no issues with transit shipments. Transit is paid and continues," a Gazprom spokesman said, referring to deliveries to Europe.

Ukraine, on the other hand, is a different story. "Today, March 7, was the deadline for payments for gas supplies to Ukraine in February. Gazprom has not received payments for the debt," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said." We cannot supply gas for free. Either Ukraine redeems debt and pays for the current deliveries, or there is a risk to return to the situation of early 2009."

The March 7 deadline for payments of $440 million came and went, and Moscow will have to decide what next steps to take. Ukraine now owes a total of $1.89 billion to Gazprom. Even if Gazprom decides to stop delivery of natural gas to Ukraine, it is far from clear that it can be done cleanly without disrupting service to the rest of Europe. Much of Russian gas sold to Europe must traverse Ukraine through a web of pipelines. Ukraine could theoretically tamper with, or divert, natural gas intended for Europe.

Moreover, cutting off gas to Ukraine, even if service to Europe is not disrupted, would escalate a conflict that has already reached crisis proportions. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a few days ago that Gazprom would end price discounts to Ukraine after they expire on April 1. Ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych agreed to accept a 33% price discount last December.

March 12 (Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd said on Wednesday that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had opened an inquiry into its operations, news that briefly sent the nutrition and weight loss company’s share price down more than 16 percent.

Billionaire investor William Ackman, who has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, has for months called on regulators to investigate Herbalife’s distribution model, which he calls a “pyramid scheme,” where a company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to real customers.

Herbalife said it “will cooperate fully with the FTC.”

“Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,” the company said in a statement. “We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”

So far, Ackman, who heads Pershing Square Capital Management, has lost money on his short bet as rivals such as businessman Carl Icahn took the other side.

Herbalife’s share price fell 16.4 percent on news of the FTC inquiry but later recovered to close at $60.57, down about 7.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.

Los Angeles-based Herbalife this week blasted Ackman for carrying out “an unfounded, relentless and fraudulent public attack on Herbalife’s business model.”

“There has never been merit to his accusations,” the company said in a statement on March 10.

News of the FTC investigation came a day after a 2-1/2 hour long conference call on which Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking the law in China.

Ackman’s $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has been shorting the stock since the middle of 2012.

The FTC has a broad reach to investigate companies which are deceptive. But it does no criminal prosecution and usually is limited to recovering money lost by affected consumers.

Its biggest recent probe was of Google, which rivals had accused of skewing search results so companies competing with Google appeared lower than appropriate. The FTC decided after an extended probe that Google broke no antitrust law in search.

The FTC issued a statement acknowledging an investigation into Herbalife but declined to discuss it. Neither Ackman nor a representative of his fund responded to requests for comment.

Ackman’s investors include state pension funds in New Jersey and Massachusetts.

Less than two months ago Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, asked both the FTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Herbalife after constituents complained of losing thousands of dollars through the company.

Online videos show top Herbalife distributors riding horses and snow mobiles and boasting about their lavish lifestyles all thanks to selling the company’s products. But Ackman and other Herbalife critics say those are empty promises.

Many Herbalife distributors are Hispanic and Brent Wilkes, executive director of the Washington-based League of United Latin American citizens, said he hoped the FTC probe could return some cash to many alleged victims of the company.

“I am not as excited as you might think about this news because so many people have lost so much money here. But I am pleased that the wheels of government seem to be working after all,” Wilkes said.##2488|☛ Want the latest procurement and supply chain news delivered straight to your inbox?

A merger between two of the biggest banana suppliers will help the companies save at least $40 million (£24 million) through logistics and procurement by the end of 2016.

Irish fruit company Fyffes and US firm Chiquita will create the world's largest banana business with circa $4.6 billion (£2.8 billion) in annual revenues. The transaction to create ChiquitaFyffes will be completed by the end of the year.

The two companies said they expect “annualised recurring before tax overhead and operational synergies of at least $40 million by the end of 2016”.

“These recurring annual synergies are anticipated to be comprised of efficiencies in the areas of logistics and procurement, among others,” the statement said.

The combined firm also plans to “broaden its geographic footprint and distribution channels” by expanding its global supply chain to improve product availability.

The statement added: “It will be well-positioned to build on each company's well-established presence in developed economies and further the progress both companies have made in expanding into high growth emerging markets worldwide.”

David McCann, Fyffes executive chairman, said: “We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”##2489|An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.

The San Jose Mercury News reported Saturday that Guinness Book of World Record officials say the $201 million life insurance policy is more than double the previous record set in 1990 by an unidentified "entertainment industry figure."

A Southern California financial services company who helped put the deal together declined to identify the buyer for safety reasons.

"We don't want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him - or members of his own estate," quipped Dovi Frances of the Santa Barbara-based SG LLC financial services company.

Frances said that the life insurance policy is actually two dozen policies underwritten by 19 different insurers. That's because no one company could afford to pay the policies' benefactors when the billionaire died.

Frances didn't disclose the annual cost to the billionaire for the policy, but did say it was in the single millions of dollars. He said Guinness officials spent six months investigating the policy before declaring it the world record.

Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Frances declined to discuss identity of the policyholder.

A spokeswoman for billionaire Elon Musk, the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors and other high-flying startups, declined to say whether he was the mystery buyer.

Frances wouldn't disclose the billionaire's age. Frances said the billionaire purchased the policy to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax.



Copyright Associated Press##2490|Empty##2491|Tokyo: Toyota Motor Corp`s Indian unit has declared a lockout of its workers at two car plants after strained salary negotiations spurred workers to stop production lines.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) in a statement said it has locked out workers at the plants near Bangalore since Sunday. It did not state for how long the lockout will continue.

Over the past 25 days, some workers have stopped production lines and disrupted business as the management, labour union and local government failed to reach an agreement over salaries, TKM said.

"The company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," TKM said.

Tokyo-based Toyota Motor spokesman Naoki Sumino said the unit and union will continue holding talks to resolve the issue.

If operations are suspended, that would result in a production loss of 700 vehicles a day, Sumino said.

TKM manufactures vehicles including the Fortuner and Innova at its 1st plant, where production started in 1997. At the 2nd plant, which opened in 2010, it makes cars including the Etios and Corolla Altis.

Toyota is not the first Japanese car maker to be hit by labour relations troubles in India.

In 2012, Suzuki Motor Corp unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd closed its Manesar plant for a month after a riot that resulted in one death, over 100 injuries and a $250 million production loss.##2492|LOS ANGELES - Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time since the suburbs began booming.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise - the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

"People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the public transportation association. "This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."

Expanding bus and train networks help spur the growth.

Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased 6 percent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines. Overall, LA Metro gained 9 million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transportation association said. Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.

Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large ridership gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.

"People want to work and live along transit lines," Melaniphy said. "Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors."##2493|Empty##2494|London, Oct 2 (IANS) John Krasinski has made for himself as an actor, director and producer. And he says balancing them all is not at…##2495|Empty##2496|China will build more railways and increase the number of small and medium-sized cities as it seeks to raise the proportion of urban residents in the population, which it sees as the country's next big engine for economic growth.

The plans are contained in a 2014-2020 urbanization document unveiled Sunday by the State Council, China's Cabinet, that was reported by the official Xinhua News Agency.

The plan says rural residents employed in cities will see their incomes rise, increasing consumption, while investment in urban infrastructure, public service facilities and housing will drive economic development.

At present, permanent urban residents make up 53.7 percent of the population of almost 1.4 billion. China plans to raise this to 60 percent of the total population by 2020 — on a par with that of developing countries with similar per capita income levels as China and lower than the average of 80 percent for developed countries.

Xinhua said the plan states that regular railways will cover cities with more than 200,000 residents by 2020 and high-speed railways with connect those with more than half a million residents.

China's urbanization first picked up pace with market reforms in the early 1980s. By 2011, half the country's population had moved into cities. However, a rigid, decades-old household registration system that assigns either urban or rural status under the old planned economy means tens of millions of migrants officially remain residents of their rural hometowns and have limited education, health and pension benefits in the cities, fueling discontent nationwide.

Xinhua said only 35.7 percent of the country's people had urban status by the end of last year and the full claims to public urban services that this entails. It said the plan calls for residents with city status to account for about 45 percent of the total population by 2020.##2497|Empty##2498|Empty##2499|Empty##2500|It appears to bear the logo of Rolls Royce, which made the plane's engines

I confess that I occasionally laugh at my mathematician friends. (They laugh at me all the time.)

What stirs me is the stimulus/response mechanism that urges them to reduce everything to math. It doesn't matte whether it's global warming or intercontinental warring, they can find a mathematical answer.

I know it's not (always) their fault, but when they start to discuss who ate what at dinner, in order to split the check, my teeth begin to talk among themselves.

I am secretly overjoyed, therefore, that mathematicians have declared that something mundane is quite difficult for them.

A random reading of New Scientist offers that Candy Crush has been officially declared NP-hard.

No, not NPR'd. NP-hard.

This doesn't stand for "No Point, but hard." Although it should. Instead, it's a mathematical term that describes the number of times a mathematician must furrow her brow, while drinking several gallons of scotch in order to solve a problem.

Should you have so far failed to play Candy Crush -- you're invited to my house for dinner and a Lava Vine grenache as a gesture of respect -- it's a game where bright pieces of candy move around and you're supposed to line them up. Or something like that.

This didn't deter Toby Walsh, adjunct professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Australia's University of New South Wales (among other things), to analyze this game and designate it a certification.

Please don't force me to take you through all his methodology. I am very results-oriented. I can tell you that he manipulated the little pieces of candy to simulate the famous Boolean satisfiability problem.

This attempts to see whether successive logical statements are in line with each other or not.

Some people call this a first date.

Walsh's conclusion is that Candy Crush is NP-complete, a strain of NP-hard. Another example of an NP-complete problem is the Traveling Salesman Problem, one which finds the shortest route to send a salesman on his way.

Any Candy Crush player who suddenly wants to show off their intelligence to their non-Crushing friends should consider first that this game isn't the only one that's deemed NP-hard.

Super Mario is alongside it, as is Legend of Zelda.

Still, the next time you're being given a hard time by a mathematician for your mental ineptitude, you can try to get him to beat you at Candy Crush.

It'll be inane, but you might enjoy it. For at least 30 minutes.##2503|Speaking at the North East Chamber of Commerce President’s Club Talk, Charlie Bean, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, summarises the key issues facing the economy.

He notes that “much of the recovery has been on the back of higher consumer spending and housing investment”. “For the recovery to be both sustained and sustainable, however, we really want to see three things happen…..business investment needs to pick up…..a revival in productivity growth….and an expansion in net exports”.

Charlie Bean notes that business investment has started to pick up and survey data on investment intentions suggest that “this revival is likely to continue”, especially since “lending and capital market conditions have improved”. He notes that productivity growth has been weaker than the MPC had expected, but looking forward, “we ought to be able to return to something approaching our pre-crisis average rate of productivity growth”.

Charlie Bean sees a need to reduce the UK trade deficit in due course, to compensate for the deterioration in the UK’s net asset income from abroad, which appears to be “primarily down to a fall in earnings on European assets”. The 25% depreciation in the sterling exchange rate “should have been sufficient to give a kick to net exports”, but “the performance of exports, has been somewhat disappointing”. “Any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports”.

Charlie then turns to the role for monetary policy in supporting the recovery. He takes the opportunity to repeat the MPC’s guidance about the future course of policy. He suggests that what is useful for businesses “is our expectation that when Bank Rate does rise, it will probably do so only gradually and to a level that is likely to remain materially below its pre-crisis average of 5% for some while – I have something like a 2-3% range in mind here.”

He concludes by saying that “It is now five years since we cut Bank Rate to its historic low of 0.5% and launched our asset purchase programme (QE). Those five years have been tough for both businesses and households. But they surely would have been even tougher had we not taken that action….. The MPC will be doing its utmost to ensure that recovery is not nipped in the bud. But when the time does come for us to start raising Bank Rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.”

"No one was hurt tonight when U.S. forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans," said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby. President Obama authorized the raid just after 10 p.m. on Sunday.

U.S. forces will escort the ship back to a port controlled by Libya's central government, which is fighting various factions for possession of the country's vast oil reserves.

The story of the Morning Glory is complicated and slightly madcap, but with serious implications for Libya and Europe, which gets oil from the country via a pipeline to Italy. On March 1, the North Korea-flagged ship turned off its satellite transponder and a week later turned up in the eastern Libyan port of Es Sider, which is controlled by a rebel militia that is trying to sell oil from the region for its own profit. On March 10, the tanker left port carrying 234,000 barrels of oil.

If breakaway regions are allowed to sell oil on their own, the Libyan government will quickly go bankrupt. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan ordered the Morning Glory stopped, even if it meant sinking the vessel. With Libya's navy essentially nonexistent and its air force embroiled in its own infighting, the militia Zeidan sent out to stop the tanker failed. Parliament then sacked Zeidan, who subsequently fled to Germany. On March 13, North Korea revoked the Morning Glory's registration, making it a stateless vessel.

Contraband oil is harder to sell than you might think. Libya could still descend into civil war, as various militias battle for resources and influence. But now at least the rebels in the oil-rich east know the risks of trying to use a heavily watched and coveted international commodity as a weapon. Peter Weber##2507|Why did this happen?

Many market participants have long viewed the yuan as a one-way appreciation bet. Authorities are trying to change that by demonstrating that it is now more of a genuine market that can go up and down like any other. "The People's Bank of China will continue to increase the two-way flexibility of the renminbi exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate fundamentally stable within reasonable and balanced levels," the PBOC said in a statement on its website. A PBOC spokesman in a separate statement said that the new flexibility would help improve efficiency and increase the decisive role of the market to allocate resources. The widening of the band had been broadly expected after the yuan fell in value from mid February through early March. Traders suspected that the central bank, working through state banks, pushed the currency down to try to force those speculating on appreciation to unwind their positions.

The idea was to leave the market more balanced between buyers and sellers to reduce the chances of dramatic moves once the trading band was widened. The central bank's clamp down came after it had guided the yuan to rise 2.9 percent against the dollar in 2013, far outperforming other emerging economy currencies and surprising markets, which had not been so bullish. That rally encouraged capital to flow into the country betting on a steady increase in Chinese interest rates, which made Chinese assets relatively attractive given the weakness of the dollar. Many Chinese importers even inflated their receipts to bring in more cash to speculate on the yuan, which repeatedly and massively distorted the country's trade figures in certain months. However, since the beginning of 2014, the central bank's action has pushed the currency down 1.6 percent. While that is not a major move for many currencies, for the yuan it marked a bigger slide than the currency posted over six months during the Greek debt crisis in 2012.

Moving markets In pushing the yuan lower, the risk was that traders bullish on the yuan would see the weaker levels as a buying opportunity. However, foreign exchange traders said that the yuan continued to fall in recent weeks and stay closer to the central bank's midpoint, even though state-owned banks had stopped intervening, indicating many bulls had been shaken out of the market. A senior money manager for an international investment fund in Shanghai, who spoke off the record because of the sensitivity of relations with regulators, said that the wider trading band would likely discourage foreign investors. "It's what China needs to do, and the smart money says, OK, this is great, this is two way, we'll have more money coming in and out. But for the next tier of investor, they see China as very hairy still, not a lot of transparency, and the only news is bad news. They don't look at this as good news they just look at it as more volatility."

Currency analysts said the shake out of bullish positions cleared the way for the PBOC to widen the trading band without worrying that the currency would immediately leap to test the upper limits of the new range. "Conditions for a band widening were ripe," said Li Heng, economist at Minsheng Securities in Beijing. Li Huiyong, an analyst at Shenyin Wanguo in Shanghai, said that allowing the yuan to trade in a wider range each day and so respond more to market forces would make the currency more attractive internationally. "China needs to internationalise the yuan and a 1 percent fluctuation cannot adequately reflect market demand for and supply of the yuan," said Beijing wants to expand the Chinese currency's footprint beyond Hong Kong, where more than 80 percent of yuan trade settlement transactions are handled, and foster greater confidence among offshore businesses to adopt the yuan, also known as the renminbi, as a currency for trade.

Its efforts have paid dividends so far, with the yuan already overtaking the euro to become the second-most used currency in trade finance, data from global transaction services organisation SWIFT showed. The central bank's announcement follows rising concerns about the implications of slowing growth in China, with some warning that Beijing might have to ease up on the pace of long-term structural market reforms aimed at migrating China to a more sustainable model. "That the central bank chose to widen the band right now shows, in some ways, that it is confident about the economy," Shenyin Wanguo's Li said. How the wider band will play into Beijing's efforts to reduce debt and wasted investment while maintaining enough growth to keep employment stable is an open question. Although widening the trading band is aimed at introducing more two-way price swings into the market, the last change in April 2012 - doubling the band to 1 percent - largely failed to do so.##2509|FRANKFURT, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s emphasis on slack in the euro zone economy at its March policy meeting shows it intends to keep interest rates low even if growth rates pick up, sending a dovish message.

Investors, however, were disappointed by the ECB’s lack of action last week, when the bank published an inflation forecast for 2016 that sees price rises still far below its target for price stability of below but close to 2 percent.

The euro rose against the dollar to a 2-1/2 year high after the ECB signalled no need for new economic stimulus and took a slightly more optimistic view of the recovery. That seemed to have drowned the dovish message the ECB intended to send.

For the first time, the ECB in the opening statement to the post-meeting news conference alluded to “the high degree of unutilised capacity” in the euro zone economy as one of the reasons for subdued inflation extending into the medium term.

“Our monetary policy stance will stay in place even after we see improvements in the economy,... because we have a stock of slack that is weighing on the economy,” ECB President Mario Draghi said.

Ahead of the meeting, a growing minority of economists polled by Reuters said the ECB may be forced to print money this year to fight off deflation risks, while some had expected a cut in interest rates, below the record low of 0.25 percent.

The fact that the ECB refrained from suspending the weekly withdrawal of money it spent on Greek and other governments’ bonds during the debt crisis - the least divisive “sterlisation” measure - suggests the ECB may have to take a big step next or none at all.

TAKING THE SHINE OFF

Deutsche Bank, for example, now expects rates to remain at a record low of 0.25 percent throughout this year.

“The ECB seems to be ‘hoping for the best’, and we have probably underestimated the limitations to the Governing Council’s room for manoeuvre on its policy instruments in the last few months,” said Gilles Moec, economist at Deutsche.

Draghi said the benefits of a so-called sterilisation of bond purchases under its Securities Markets Programme were “relatively limited” because of the short maturity of the bonds still in the SMP portfolio, currently worth 175 billion euros ($242.58 billion).

A programme to revive the market for securitised loans, especially for small and medium sized companies, remains on the agenda, but may require legal and regulatory changes and third party guarantees in order to work, Draghi said.

The ECB could launch another long-term refinancing operation (LTRO), similar to the three-year loans they handed out in late 2011 and early 2012 to ease banks’ funding strains, but banks are increasingly paying back such loans early.

Which leaves the most powerful tool to fight deflation, quantitative easing, by which the central bank would buy securities from banks that have then more money to lend.

But while other major central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have long been relying on this stimulus, QE would be a highly political tool to agree on in the euro zone with its 18 member countries.

Inflation would have to undershoot the ECB’s target for price stability significantly to sway the Governing Council.

A further appreciation of the euro might do just that.

The euro hit a 2-1/2 year high on Friday at $1.3915.

ECB Governing Council member Christian Noyer said on Monday he was “not very happy” with the recent appreciation of the euro’s exchange rate, because it put downward pressure on the economy and on inflation.

The rub is they can't do much more than that.

Anyone unlucky enough to have a Bitcoin wallet at MtGox can now log in to see their account, if only to confirm what could be available to them should the company manage to sort its affairs out.

"Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgement by MtGox Co, Ltd of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users," MtGox says on its website.

"Rehabilitation claims under a civil rehabilitation procedure become confirmed from a filing which is followed by an investigation procedure. The method for filing claims will be published on this site as soon as we will be in situation to announce it."

The reference to rehabilitation claims comes from a Japanese court order it gained on February 28, which prevented it from paying out creditors.

The bankruptcy claim there and in the US came just weeks after the emergence of denial of service attacks on bitcoin wallets that exploited a "transaction malleability issue" to tamper with confirmation details that are used in an exchange between bitcoin wallets.

In early February both MtGox and its main rival, Bitstamp, temporarily suspended withdrawals due to attacks linked to the bug. The Bitcoin Foundation said that the problem affecting wallets could result in bitcoins being tied up in unconfirmed transactions, but not in stolen bitcoin.

Tuesday was the first time MtGox users have had any form of access to their wallets since its closure on 25 February , a day after it resigned from its position on the Bitcoin Foundation board.

MtGox users had already been prevented from initiating withdrawals for several weeks before the company revealed in its bankruptcy filing that some 850,000 bitcoins under its management had vanished due to a software bug "in the bitcoin system".

The Bitcoin Foundation has insisted the issues Mt Gox was experiencing were due to its implementation of the bitcoin wallet, as opposed a bug in bitcoin itself.

The company said it received a civil investigative demand from the FTC, adding that it will fully co-operate with the investigation.

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations," the company said in a statement.

"Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years."

Following the announcement, the company's shares fell about 13% on Wall Street.

The probe against the company comes after a year of intense scrutiny of the company, which sells nutritional shakes and supplements via multi-level marketing involving a network of millions of independent distributors in more than 80 countries worldwide.

A source familiar with the probe told CNBC that Herbalife was surprised by the investigation but thought it was the best way to combat allegations about the company's business model. The probe is expected to last a year or more.

Bill Ackman's Gamble

Activist investor Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square has been targeting the company in a short-sale campaign, gambling more than $1bn (£602m, €721m) on the prospect that Herbalife would fail because it is operating as an illegal pyramid scheme.

Since December 2012, Ackman has spent millions of dollars in a public campaign against Herbalife, accusing the company of making most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products. He has gathered lobbyists, community organisers and members of Congress to push regulators to probe the company.

Herbalife has refuted the claim, saying that Ackman's attack on the company is "unfounded, relentless and fraudulent".

"Ackman's unprecedented campaign to destroy Herbalife has now been exposed for what it is: a cynical, self-serving attempt to manipulate the market by buying his way into an investigation to cover his own reckless $1bn dollar bet," the company earlier said in a response to a New York Times report.

Los Angeles-based Herbalife uses multi-level marketing to sell its nutritional supplements and weight-loss products. Companies such as Amway, cosmetics companies Avon and Mary Kay and kitchen products maker Tupperware, use a similar strategy of marketing products through independent contractors.##2515|Empty##2516|Empty##2517|Google is getting ready for a stock split. The search giant has been expected to split their stock for quite some time, though nothing has come of it until now. In addition to the split, they will have three categories of stock for purchase. The lower-end pricing after the split is still expected to be well out of the reach of most of us, though.

The stock will now be split into three categories, with the third being the new listing. Here’s how it will shake out:

Class A stock: This is already traded on the market.

Class B stock: Employee stock, which has ten times the voting power of Class A stock.

Class C stock: New. Offered publicly, Class C has no voting power.

In splitting the stock, Google is effectively listing themselves twice on the stock exchange (Class A and C), which had some concerned the S&P 500 would drop one of them. In a surprise move, the S&P notes they’ll offer both Google stocks, which is a change to their policy of only having a company’s stock listed once on their index. Though there will still be 500 companies on the index, the S&P is choosing to list additional stock, potentially opening themselves up to other stock splits to those on their index.

Even with a split, the stock should still be right around $600 for both A and C. The split is designed to keep Larry and Sergey in control, which was the idea behind a different split years ago. By offering ten times the voting power, and holding a big portion of stock, the two can effectively run Google as they like. We think they’ve done a pretty amazing job so far.

On the NSE, the stock slipped 6.42 per cent to Rs 565.50.

According to the information available on USFDA website, the regulator has issued an import alert, which enables 'detention without physical examination of drugs from firms which have not met drug GMPs'.

Comments from the company could not be obtained immediately.

This is the first import alert for any of Sun Pharma's plants from the USFDA, which has been cracking down heavily on firms such as Ranbaxy and Wockhardt that have not complied with its manufacturing norms.

Under questioning by the Treasury select committee, the Bank's executive director for markets Paul Fisher defended the decision to destroy recordings as it could be "hard to follow" the "free-flowing" discussion between MPC members, who meet to discuss the future path of interest rates, and that the members may feel unable to speak frankly.

As Fisher issued his defence, one of the MPs on the Treasury select committee was heard to mutter "shades of Nixon", a reference to the former US President and his alleged attempts to destroy tapes of discussions between him and White House officials that came to light during the Watergate scandal.

Tory Treasury select committee member Andrea Leadsom told HuffPostUK: "More transparency is always a good thing."

When Paul Fisher admitted today that MPC recordings are routinely deleted, one of the MPs muttered “shades of Nixon”. Not sure which one… — Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) March 11, 2014

Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, pointed out that the US Federal Reserve released transcripts of its own meetings with a five year lag.

In a statement after the meeting, he added: “I have yet to hear a good argument against keeping verbatim records of MPC meetings, published with a long time lag - probably longer than the maximum term of an external member.

“There seem to me to be a good number of arguments for keeping such records, among them, to bolster public confidence that the minutes published after MPC hearings are an accurate reflection of what was said.”

A Bank spokesman said: "When the MPC was first set up, we experimented with producing transcripts. But we quickly realised the nature of the discussion - nine economists debating current economic issues - meant that the transcripts were very difficult to follow.

"Moreover, we were concerned that the knowledge that the transcripts would be subsequently published may affect the nature of the discussion, with more formal interventions rather than free-flowing debate and discussion. As such, the MPC publish detailed minutes, two weeks after their meeting. These have been carefully written to ensure they are accessible and accurately reflect the full range of the MPC's debate, including description of all dissenting views."##2532|Empty##2533|Empty##2534|SINGAPORE, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures slipped in early Asian trade on Monday, as data showing an unexpected fall in China’s exports added to fears of a slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy, stoking demand growth concerns.

But worries over supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and north African exporter Libya limited falls.

U.S. oil dropped 20 cents to $102.35 a barrel by 0048, after touching a high of $102.82. It rose to an intra-day high of $102.91 a barrel on Friday before settling up $1.02.

Brent crude fell 37 cents to $108.63 a barrel, after ending 90 cents higher.

FUNDAMENTALS

* China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

* Armed protesters in eastern Libya traded threats with the government on Sunday in a tense stand-off over the unauthorised sale of oil from a rebel-held port.

* Germany’s Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution.

* U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.

MARKETS NEWS

* Asian stocks slipped in early trade on Monday and the dollar stepped back from its recent highs as disappointing Chinese trade data and uncertainty over the crisis in Ukraine kept risk appetite in check.

For the most part, economic circles are greeting the move with a yawn, though the consensus is that this could slow (or just maybe even stop) the Chinese currency’s long, upward crawl in the near term.

First of all, there seems to be agreement that this isn’t a very big deal in the grand scheme of things. This, because the central bank will still set its desired “parity rate” (the level that determines the center of each day’s trading band, now widened to 2% above or below the parity rate).

Société Générale China economist Wei Yao says: “Widening the band is a relatively easy promise to deliver. The more difficult and more meaningful one is for the People’s Bank of China to really let go its control over the exchange rate.”

Likewise, Capital Economics chief Asia economist Mark Williams says: “If the PBOC was really confident that the renminbi [another name for the yuan] was now close to its market value, it would leave the reference rate to the market. But that still, apparently, remains a step too far.”

While the move may be small potatoes to some, many economists also say it’s not completely without consequence. Generally, they see the change to the trading band as more likely to weigh on China’s currency than to send it rising faster.

Although Standard Chartered said the wider band “does not have direct implications for medium-term yuan appreciation or depreciation dynamics,” it adds that the change makes their previous target for the yuan look “a little aggressive.”

As a result, StanChart now sees the dollar buying 6.02 yuan at the end of the third quarter, up from 5.98 yuan previously. On the other hand, the bank’s year-end projection remains at 5.92 yuan.

Over at Daiwa, they’re taking a stronger view that the yuan will now weaken — you can read the details of this argument in Craig Stephen’s “This Week in China” column.

J.P. Morgan also sees a weaker yuan, but just for the near term (they keep their year-end forecast at 5.95 yuan). They note that the last time the trading band was widened in 2012, the yuan fell in value for a short while. And certainly, we’ve seen some pullback for the yuan this month already.

Of course, any weakening in the Chinese currency helps Chinese exporters, and J.P. Morgan says a softer yuan would also stop those pesky hot-money inflows that has worried the PBOC recently. So maybe this is a good thing, for China at least.##2541|Interest rates will soar to 3% by 2017, as Britainís economic recovery begins to fully gather momentum, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney has identified.

Carney estimated that rates would soar up from their current historically low value of 0.5% in the next three years, forecasting that they could eventually reach as high as 3% at the end of 2017.

Mr Carneyís comments are thought to be a direct response to an announcement made by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, who this week identified the UK as the country with the quickest growing economy in the western world.

The OECD estimated that Britainís economy would grow by an astonishing 3.3% during the first 6 months this year, taking its growth rate past any G7 country at present.

The governor had previously refused to buckle under intense pressure to raise interest rates prematurely, citing that the countryís economic recovery thus far has been ëunsustainableí. He argued that other factors such as labour productivity and real wages had to pick up before he would begin to raise rates, and outlined that he would attach the speed in which he would implement hikes to the countryís overall economic performance in the future.

However, the OECDís forecasts have likely given him the assurance he has been looking for on the countryís economic recovery, though he has still maintained a cautious stance and identified that he will only adopt a reactionary approach when it comes to raising rates in the future.

ìWhen the time comes, a welcome time to raise rates, we expect it to be gradual, and the degree to be limited,î he said.

Savers boosted by borrowers set to struggle

The news that rates will begin to rise soon, and then creep up to a more normal 3% by 2017 will be welcome to the ears of Britainís embattled aspiring savers, who have been subjected to a series of torrid and low rate offerings from banks whilst rates have been kept low.

With ISA season approaching, it is likely that savers will take Carneyís remarks to imply that rates will rise sooner rather than later, and might opt to wait before fixing their money into a savings account.

However, whilst savers have been given a much needed boost, it is the countryís swarms of borrowers who are set to be subjected to a huge financial transformation in their monthly outgoings towards their loans, with rate rises inevitably leading to a rise in the costs of borrowing.

In particular, households who currently already squeeze their income to the limit in order to subsidise the costs of their mortgages are at the most risk, with Carney warning that ëa large number of households are in vulnerable positionsí with rate rises imminent.

The groups that will struggle the most are those who currently pay their mortgages on an interest only basis, as these people would have contributed nothing towards their mortgage and will see a huge rise in the amount they pay on interest alone in the next three years.

Brokers have estimated that mortgage repayments for someone who has a £300,000 mortgage could rise by almost £500, if rates creep up to 3%, and this is even higher for someone paying on an interest only basis, which would see their monthly contributions rise even further.

They also expect a host of people to opt to try and fix their mortgage this year, with rate rises bringing about far higher monthly mortgage contributions.

ëCurrent generation at financial riskí

Nationwide, one of the UKís largest mortgage distributors criticised the Bank of England for keeping rates at 0.5% for so long, arguing that they had left a generation of homeowners completely unprepared for dealing with the normal costs of borrowing, and warned that many could be at financial risk when they are subjected to regular costs for the first time.

Worryingly, their data indicates that 8% of people who currently have mortgages are contributing 35% of their income before tax on their mortgages, implying that their wages are already being squeezed in order to afford rapidly rising costs in the housing market.

And the Bank of England have forecasted that this percentage would double when rates rise beyond 2.5%, meaning that some people could be faced with the bleak situation that they are contributing 70% of their wage just to their mortgage costs.

Monetary Policy Committee member, David Miles, said that the affects of rate rises on people who currently have higher rate loans could be far more detrimental than on others.

He outlined that the disparity in borrowing costs for banks and other external lenders from sector had increased, and urged borrowers to be cautious when taking out loans from institutions that have higher rates than banks.

However, Mr Miles allayed fears that rises would go any further than 3% in the future, identifying that the global finance sector had evolved so that it would no longer be suitable to have rates as high as 5%.

ìThe equilibrium is a bit lower than the level we used to think of as normal ñ 5 per cent. We will not get back to the old normal,î Mr Miles said.

Miles suggested that the new norm for interest rates would be between 2.5% and 3%, which means that savers may never have as an accommodating climate as they did prior to the start of the economic downturn in 2008.##2542|Due to its greater reach along the U.S. East Coast arising from its recent merger with US Airways, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) said Monday that it has ended its inline agreements with JetBlue Airways Corp. (NASDAQ: JBLU), which covered ticketing, baggage handling and frequent-flyer programs.

Such agreements allow customers to buy connecting flights for participating carriers on one ticket, and they allow airlines to offer more destinations without having to make large investments. JetBlue has similar agreements with 30 other carriers, and CEO Dave Barger said Monday that the partnership with American Airlines was “not overly material when we think about the other partnerships that we have.”

Also, customers of American Airlines and JetBlue using their reciprocal frequent-flyer programs will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, as of April 1. Points already accrued through the partnership would be credited to customers’ accounts and will not be affected.

American also reported Monday that severe weather had an impact on performance in the first two months of the year. However, total revenue passenger miles for February were up 0.5% year-on-year to 15.1 billion, and total capacity was 0.8% higher to 19.2 billion available seat miles.

American Airlines shares were up fractionally to $39.10 in mid-day trading Monday. The 52-week range is $14.71 to $39.88.

March 11 (BusinessDesk) Stocks and commodities including copper and iron ore fell after a surprise drop in Chinas exports bolstered concern about the slowing growth in the worlds second-largest economy.



While you were sleeping: China hits stocks, copper

March 11 (BusinessDesk) – Stocks and commodities including copper and iron ore fell after a surprise drop in China’s exports bolstered concern about the slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy.

China’s exports sank 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, according to General Administration of Customs data on the weekend. As a result, copper futures for May delivery shed 1.5 percent to US$3.0355 a pound in afternoon trading on the Comex in New York, extending Friday’s slide of about 4 percent.

In afternoon trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.35 percent, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.14 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.13 percent lower.

“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” IPR Capital director Steven Mayne told Reuters.

Slides in shares of Boeing, last down 2.3 percent, and those of Verizon, last down 0.9 percent, led declines in the Dow.

Boeing was dragged lower after saying it would inspect wings for cracks on undelivered 787s, and after a 777 flown by Malaysian Airline System disappeared over the ocean three days ago.

“News of the wing and inspections likely lower first quarter deliveries, plus the 777 aircraft incident in Asia will likely weigh on the Boeing stock this week,” Peter Arment, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach, told Bloomberg News.

In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.5 percent drop from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 fell 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX gave up 0.9 percent. France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent.

Concern about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine keeps weighing on markets worldwide.

Meanwhile, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser reiterated his concern that the US economy might be stronger than policy makers anticipate and suggested the Fed should accelerate the tapering of its monthly bond-buying programme.

On Friday, a report showed American employers added a higher-than-expected 175,000 jobs, while January’s jobs gain was revised up. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, from 6.6 percent.

“I expect that the unemployment rate will reach about 6.2 percent by the end of 2014, and, if anything, that may prove too pessimistic,” Plosser said in a speech in Paris. “Given the recent trends, an unemployment rate below 6 percent is certainly plausible.”

“Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts,” Plosser said.

Original url##2546|Now anonymous hackers believe they have the answer – they're still in Mt Gox. "On Sunday," reports Forbes, "hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users."

The blog has since been taken down, but the hackers' message is available on Pastebin. "It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data."

The message provides a link to a zip file. "Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included."

The hackers also provide what they claim to be the balances of virtual currencies still existent – and it includes more than 950,000 bitcoins. This alone is proof of nothing. Forbes points out, "I couldn’t verify that Sunday’s database dump was real, or that it showed any of the 'lying' that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox’s accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins–that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves."

Nevertheless, the lack of movement for the stolen bitcoins has puzzled the community. On Friday, however, writing in Coindesk, Danny Bradbury noted that a wallet most likely owned by Mt Gox had started to be active. This wallet had been dormant until July 2012, when it started receiving small transactions. "However," writes Bradbury, "no coins left that wallet, until today, when its 50,000 bitcoins were sent to another address, as part of outputs from various bitcoin addresses totaling 180,000 bitcoins ($113 million)."

Since then, he continues, "these coins have been rapidly splitting, with coins being subdivided repeatedly. One branch was found to have been splitting every 30 minutes in what appeared to be an automated fashion. This suggests that there may be some code splitting the coins."

Why this is happening is not so clear. "One explanation is that it makes the coins easier to use for a high volume of transactions," suggests Bradbury. Another possibility, of course, is that it also makes them harder to trace.

It is not absolutely clear that the bitcoins concerned are still 'owned' by Mt Gox, but bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell suggests they are. "Maxwell also argued that the splitting behavior is consistent with a function in the leaked source code from Mt Gox," writes Bradbury. "This suggests that some of the coins have been dropped into the Mt Gox online wallet, and that the system is now automatically breaking them up, he said."

One thing is clear: the Mt Gox debacle is still posing more questions than it is providing answers.##2547|Empty##2548|The Affordable Care Act’s open enrollment period is quickly winding down and millions of uninsured continued to be bombarded with philosophical arguments about whether to enroll or forgo ACA-mandated coverage. But lost in a lot of the political rhetoric is a simple fact about being covered:

When you have health insurance, you save money every time you seek care – even if you never meet your deductible – because of an often-overlooked benefit of being insured. It’s called negotiated discount rates.

In its simplest terms, it means anyone who’s insured does not pay full price. I was reminded of this feature when I received my first Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the insurance plan I chose from my state exchange after my yearly oncologist visit in February.

Many of us might not consider something called the “allowed amount” or “negotiated discounts” when we purchase insurance. But what this benefit means is that a healthcare provider or facility may list what it “charges” for the services. However, because that provider or facility has agreed to be part of an insurance network, the provider and/or facility have agreed to accept a discounted amount for their services. Without insurance one would pay the “sticker price” from the provider or facility.

For example, let’s look at two of my EOBs. One was for $435 of laboratory tests ordered by my oncologist. One column on the EOB lists each test and their full cost. In the next column it lists “amount allowed”-that which the lab has agreed to accept as the payment for those tests because of the insurance plan I chose. The “allowed amount” on the full price of $435 was $137.72, meaning that by being part of an insurance network, I did not have to pay an additional $297.28 for those tests. Had I had no insurance, my “total amount owed” column would have been $435.

Charges for my bone scan totaled $1,101.00. Again, because I had insurance coverage, the total reimbursement the facility would see was calculated to be $477.21. Thus, I saved $623.79 because I was part of an insurance plan. Had I been uninsured, I would have been on point to pay the full price. The same principle applies to any prescription drug benefit. With an insurance plan that also has a prescription drug benefit – a standard could be a copay of $10 for generics and $75 for brand drugs – full out-of-pocket costs are reduced, sometimes dramatically.

This is not a column to debate the pros and cons of how we calculate charges for health care services. Rather it’s intended to be a reminder that when someone is insured they save money because they are part of an insurance system that has negotiated rates with health care providers and facilities.

It’s a simple fact that often is overlooked, underreported, or not clearly understood. But it is something that can have a real impact on pocketbooks across the nation as individuals decide whether to purchase insurance as part of the ACA.

Many factors go into an individual’s decision on whether to purchase health insurance or not. As the days dwindle for those currently uninsured to be able to sign up for coverage, the best advice still remains: talk to someone who understands the health care system.

With the enrollment deadline approaching, a discussion with a licensed, ACA-certified insurance agent – or even a knowledgeable navigator – would be a wise move. Make sure you know what all your options are, where your savings come from when you purchase insurance, and how you can position yourself to take the best care of your health and the charges associated with it.##2549|Many businesses are still dealing with the woes of the U.S. economy and Quiznos is no exception.

-Erika Benton-Martin (@leftcoast_rika)##2550|Rightly or wrongly, markets continue the Fed fixation. Many expect (or demand?) a change in Fed policy. This week marks the first FOMC meeting with Janet Yellen as the Chair. Since there will also be an update to forecasts, the announcement will include a press conference. With some fresh data and plenty of news since the last meeting, my theme for this week:

Fed Chair Yellen will take center stage.

Last Week's Theme Recap

I expected last week's theme (in the absence of much real data) to be focused on a parade of pontificating pundits. That was very accurate. As predicted, there were many articles of the laundry list type. That is where the pundit or journalist starts with a scary theme that can be expected to be popular and then looks back to find some similarities with the past. What a joke! Suppose you had a group of summer interns. Ask them to take any year in history and read newspapers, listing anything that is similar to current times. They will deliver.

Most people have a low bar for research findings, particularly when it suits their own conclusions.

This is a perfect illustration of the reason for my weekly post – planning for the week ahead. Readers are invited to play along with the "theme forecast." I spend a lot of time on it each week. It helps to prepare your game plan for the week ahead, and it is not as easy as you might think.

This Week's Theme

How should we get ready for this week's Fed announcement? There are three basic positions:

Rate hikes might come faster than expected. This is for one of two main reasons: Lower labor force participation (Matthew Boesler at BI). Lower growth potential (Morgan Stanley's Vince Reinhart via Joe Weisenthal). There is plenty of labor slack from cyclical forces, suggesting the need for patience. Fed expert par excellence Tim Duy explains in a thoughtful article with many charts. It defies summary, so those who want to understand need to read it. Status quo. See Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. (Via Reuters).

We will probably start the week with breaking news from Ukraine, but by Wednesday our focus will, once again, be on the Fed.

I have some thoughts that I will share in the conclusion. First, let us do our regular update of the last week's news and data. Readers, especially those new to this series, will benefit from reading the background information.



Last Week's Data

Each week I break down events into good and bad. Often there is "ugly" and on rare occasion something really good. My working definition of "good" has two components:

The news is market-friendly. Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test. And especially -- no politics. It is better than expectations.

The Good

In a light week for data, there was some good news.

Earnings growth remains solid – both reported and forecast. The last quarter of 2013 approached the 10% growth predicted by Brian Gilmartin and few others. In Brian's most recent update he highlights the three time frames you should use when thinking about earnings growth:

The quarter being reported, i.e. q4 '13, is very robust. Hard to argue with +9.8% y/y earnings growth; The quarter within which we currently reside, which starts getting reported early April '14. Current consensus estimate of +2%, will likely decline over the next 3 weeks, and then by mid-May, once the majority of companies report, we will likely end up between 4% – 5%, maybe better; Full-year '14, which like q1 '14 has been impacted by weather. I think the 2nd half of '14 will be stronger than the first half of '14. Retail sales beat expectations with a gain of 0.3% and 1.5% YoY. The monthly result was less impressive when considering revisions to the prior months. Calculated Risk notes that the YoY gain is 2.2% if you exclude gasoline sales. Doug Short has a great chart package. This one shows why the most recent update is (perhaps) not so exciting:

Monthl Core Retail Sales and Services YoY

The number of US millionaires is at a new high – 9.63 million versus 9.2 million in 2007. (LA Times).

Initial jobless claims hit a new low – 315,000. It is a noisy series, but this is encouraging.

Job turnover data remains positive. It was in line with expectations, but as Calculated Risk notes, it confirms a positive trend. The two things to watch are job openings and the quit rate (higher quits are very positive). You can see both from this chart:

Hires and Separations Monthly

The Bad

There was also some bad news.

High frequency indicators continue to be weaker. I always read carefully the fine weekly summary from New Deal Democrat. He collects many concurrent indicators that each might seem minor, but collectively are quite significant. He documents a continuing overall soft patch.

Copper prices are in a dramatic decline. The market seems to be reacting to this news. Some even infer a global recession from the recent message from "Dr. Copper." The current pricing is heavily influenced by China – important, but not necessarily the only global factor. Dr. Ed prefers the CRB to copper, and discusses other factors as well. Here is the Yardeni chart:

Copper Price and Industrial Spot Price Index

More Americans see Russia as a threat – 69% according to a CNN poll. 40% also fear a nuclear war with Russia. (If you share this fear, how should you invest? Answer in the conclusion.)

Michigan sentiment disappointed. I regard this as an important indicator for both employment and consumption. It is time for a fresh look at my favorite chart of this data series, one that combines the history, GDP, recessions, and the average level. Naturally, it is from Doug Short.

Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index

Ukraine developments. Regardless of one's interpretation of events, the market will definitely interpret added tensions as negative. Stories about troop movements to the Crimean border will definitely rile the markets. As has been the case for the last two weeks, anything I write can be obsolete by the time you read it. Separate your interest as a citizen from your decisions as an investor. I have heard several stories about people who sold all of their stocks because of these events. In addition to the excellent sources I have provided over the last two weeks, I recommend this article by William A. Watts of MarketWatch. It emphasizes the investment perspective. I love the comment from my friend and colleague Scott Rothbort, who writes a daily "Gut Feeling" column on the markets: This is a game of chess, not battleship.

Recent Expert Commentary on Recession Odds and Market Trends

Georg Vrba: Updates his newest recession indicator, maintaining an increase in the "weeks to recession" from 26 to 27. This does not mean that there will be a recession in 27 weeks. Instead, it shows that the chance is "statistically remote" that a recession would start during that time. Georg's BCI index also shows no recession in sight. For those interested in gold, Georg also sees a possible buy signal next month. Stay tuned!

Bob Dieli does a monthly update (subscription required) after the employment report and also a monthly overview analysis. He follows many concurrent indicators to supplement our featured "C Score." One of his conclusions is whether a month is "recession eligible." None so far – and Bob has been far more accurate than the high-profile punditry.

David Rosenberg's indicators suggest no recession and probably two more years of growth. His analysis will sound familiar to our regular readers, since it has been our message for almost three years:

For Rosenberg, the central question is whether the U.S. economy will relapse into a recession. Once you answer that question, he said, you can debate the direction of the equity and fixed-income markets.

The U.S. economy is incredibly resilient, he said, and he agreed with the adage that a recovery never "dies of old age." It takes a "negative shock" to start a recession, he said - "and those always have the Fed's thumbprint on them."

A severe foreign-based shock is unlikely to derail U.S. growth, he said. Rosenberg noted that our economy and markets had good performance following the Asian crisis in 1997.

The Week Ahead

After a week of light data, this week is more normal.

The "A List" includes the following:

Initial jobless claims (Th). Best concurrent read on the most important subject. Confirmation for new lows?

Housing starts and building permits (T). Housing could be an economic driver. These are leading indicators.

Industrial production (M). February data for a key GDP component.

The "B List" includes:

Existing home sales (Th). Less important than new construction, but still a good measure.

Leading indicators (Th). Still widely followed.

CPI (T). With no signs of inflation, this remains a secondary indicator.

Fed stress test results (Th – after the close). Some background here.

The FOMC announcement on Wednesday followed by Yellen's first press conference will be the big event for the week. I am less interested in the regional Fed results.

How to Use the Weekly Data Updates

In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week. I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients. Each client is different, so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs. It is not a "one size fits all" approach.

To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self-assessment of your objectives. Are you most interested in preserving wealth? Or like most of us, do you still need to create wealth? How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances?

My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames. They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage.

Insight for Traders

Three weeks ago Felix made a dramatic switch from neutral to bullish adding trading positions throughout the week. That has worked pretty well. We remain fully invested. Many sectors have returned to the penalty box, reflecting reduced overall confidence in the three-week forecast.

It has been tougher than ever for traders, and that is saying a lot. This Taiwan Stock Exchange study says that "Less than 1% of the day trader population is able to predictably and reliably earn positive abnormal returns net of fees."

Insight for Investors

I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed. For investors, as we would expect, the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders. The current "actionable investment advice" is summarized here.

This is still an important time for long-term investors. We all know that market corrections of 15% or so occur regularly without any special provocation. Recent years have been the exception. Over the last several weeks I have emphasized the need to maintain perspective, using market declines to add to positions.

It helps if you have been actively rebalancing your portfolio and trimming winners. Then you have some cash. Some readers have asked me to write more on this topic, so I have placed it on the agenda. For now, let me do a quick summary.

Review your holdings regularly. (For me, that means at least weekly, but it is my job. Quarterly is probably enough for most people, perhaps with some price alerts). Make sure that your original reasons for the investment are still valid. Revise your fair value and price target estimates. Do not fall in love with a position. If hanging on to a disappointing holding, make sure your reasons are sound. Sell if your price target is hit. Rebalance by trimming if a stock appreciates massively, but remains below the price target.

Each week I highlight some of the best advice I see. Here are some highlights.

Eddy Elfenbein has a typically level-headed analysis about what long-term investors can expect from stocks: 5% in real terms, half from capital appreciation and half from dividends. If you expect some inflation, you need to add that. Stocks are a good inflation-fighter. Read the full post for comparisons with some recent bearish arguments. If you are a good picker of stocks, you might add a little to that.

Value Line's famous strategist, Sam Eisentadt, sees another 12% in stocks before September. No guarantees of course, but he asks if anyone has a method with a better track record for six-month changes. (Via Mark Hulbert).

Barry Ritholtz addresses the issue: How Market Tops Get Made

This is a good analysis of key factors developed over decades of research, so read about each. Here is a key quote:

What does all this mean for the current run? According to Lowry's, "the weight of evidence continues to suggest a healthy primary uptrend with no end in sight." For those concerned with a market top, that is rather bullish.

A few caveats about Desmond's studies: Although he is rigorous and empirically driven, these data points all come from past market behavior. There are no guarantees that in the future, markets -- that means you, Humans -- will continue to operate the same way. Perhaps the changing structure of markets might impact market internals. Maybe the rise of ETFs will have an impact. Regardless, there are no guarantees the bull will continue.

However, based on the data Desmond follows, he makes a fairly convincing case that this bull market still has a ways to go before it tops out.

Steven Russolillo of the WSJ takes on the same topic with a checklist from Strategas Research Partners:

Bull Market Top Checklist

Why choose these sources to highlight? Integrity. Using indicators that have worked for years. This is in sharp contrast to those who start with a viewpoint and switch whenever the indicator no longer works. In a continuing exercise in futility, I wrote about this topic last week here and here. Most people would prefer to be scared witless (TM OldProf). Which leads to…

And finally, most Americans have missed the rally – so far—according to Bloomberg. If that describes you, you have company. This is one of the problems where we can help. It is possible to get reasonable returns while controlling risk. Check out our recent recommendations in our new investor resource page -- a starting point for the long-term investor. (Comments and suggestions welcome. I am trying to be helpful and I love and use feedback).

Final Thought

I am well aware of the difference between perceptions and reality. The former is of greater interest to traders. Many of them have been caught off base (switching metaphors for the new season) and blame the Fed for their own mistakes. (See Fed as a Fig Leaf).

The reality is that the current QE rendition is having only a small economic effect and it will matter little when it goes. (See my QE summary.)

One of my regular themes is the over-emphasis on the Fed rather than economic fundamentals --- earnings, recession risk, and potential financial stress. That focus will pay off for long-term investors.

Quiz Answer: Too easy, perhaps, but the answer comes from Art Cashin. He was a trainee during the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962). I remember reading the story nearly thirty years ago – and it was old then!! (See Paul Vigna). You might as well buy, since if they don't find a solution, it won't matter!##2551|The largest U.S. mortgage lender has updated its mortgage rates for Tuesday, March 11.

The coffee chain says the mobile-tipping option will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19.

The app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of 10 purchases at Starbucks now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1, or $2 within two hours of the transaction at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks in the United States that are company-owned.

But tipping can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers, and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing baristas don’t earn that much. Others say they already fork over enough money.

Zee Lemke, 30, a Starbucks barista in Wisconsin for more than three years, said mobile tipping has the potential to boost the amount she earns. Still, she doesn’t like the idea of employers relying on tips to compensate workers. ‘‘It’s a way of claiming workers make more than you’re paying them,’’ she said.

Starbucks, meanwhile, has been pushing to get people to sign up for its mobile app and rewards program, which could help boost the number of times people visit its stores. The Seattle-based company says the mobile-tipping option is a response to demand from customers, many of whom no longer carry around much cash.

‘‘We asked our customers what they thought would be easiest and best,’’ said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer. There are no plans to bring the mobile-tipping option to stores licensed to other operators, however.

How Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss-Riordan, a Boston lawyer who represented workers in lawsuits saying shift supervisors should not share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.

‘‘They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees . . . based on the number of hours worked,’’ she said.

As for the tips earned through mobile payments, Starbucks said they will be paid to workers in cash, in line with however they receive their regular tips.##2553|THE Deputy Governor of the Bank of England addressed North-East business leaders today, outlining the challenges still faced by the recovering UK economy.

Charlie Bean was speaking to bosses of around 170 of the region’s largest businesses at the North East Chamber of Commerce’s President’s Club, held at Rockliffe Hall, Darlington.

Mr Bean, a Professor of Economics who has lectured at the London School of Economics and has been a visiting Professor at Stanford University, spoke about what needs to happen if the economic recovery is to be sustained and how the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee is supporting it.



Summarising the key issues facing the UK economy, Mr Bean said: “Much of the recovery has been on the back of higher consumer spending and housing investment.



“For the recovery to be both sustained and sustainable, however, we really want to see three things happen…..business investment needs to pick up…..a revival in productivity growth….and an expansion in net exports”.



He concluded by saying that, “It is now five years since we cut Bank Rate to its historic low of 0.5 per cent and launched our asset purchase programme (QE). Those five years have been tough for both businesses and households. But they surely would have been even tougher had we not taken that action.

"The MPC will be doing its utmost to ensure that recovery is not nipped in the bud. But when the time does come for us to start raising Bank Rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.”



Mr Bean has served in a variety of public policy roles, including: as consultant to HM Treasury; as special adviser to both the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons and to the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament; and as special adviser to the House of Lords enquiry into the European Central Bank.

He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.



NECC President, Dave Laws, said: “I was delighted to welcome Charlie Bean to the region. We have seen via NECC’s Quarterly Economic Survey and the Government’s GVA statistics that the recovery is well underway in the North- East, and the positivity of the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England’s speech seemed to rubber stamp that.



“Charlie’s speech also delivered an important message to businesses and that is that while things are getting better, but we must continue to work hard if we are to secure sustained economic recovery.”



NECC President’s Club represents companies and organisations from a wide-range of sectors including services, manufacturing, education, and professional, to local authorities, housing groups and the public sector.



Established in late 2010 its members employ around 25 per cent of the region’s workforce. Three President’s Clubs are held each year with over 150 attendees for each event.



Rockliffe Hall managing director, Nick Holmes, said: “It’s very encouraging to see more organisations opting to host major events outside of London. The demand for outstanding facilities and good transport links in a region that has a lot to offer are crucial- all of which the North-East has.

"Business tourism is vital for the region and it was with great pleasure that we welcomed the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England and the NECC to Rockliffe Hall. Our aim is to constantly break into new markets to ensure that the North-East region is well and truly on the business- and leisure- tourism map and it’s a privilege to be able to host events like this.”##2554|Empty##2555|Malaysia said Monday the search for a missing passenger jet is under way along both the northern and southern corridors where it is believed to have been deliberately diverted.



Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein says 26 countries are involved in the search, including in water and on land in 11 countries. The search spans tens of millions of square kilometers.







"Today I can confirm that the search-and-rescue operations in the northern and southern corridors have already begun. Countries including Malaysia, Australia, China, Indonesia, and Kazakhstan have already initiated search-and-rescue operations. The (Malaysian) Royal Air Force and the Royal National Navy have deployed assets to the southern corridor."







Investigators believe the Boeing 777 flew either north toward Central Asia or south, deeper into the vast Indian Ocean in the hours after it mysteriously vanished on March 8.



Australia on Monday agreed to take charge of the southern section of the search, at the request of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.







"He asked that Australia take responsibility for the search in the southern vector, which the Malaysian authorities now think was one possible flight path for this ill-fated aircraft. I agreed that we would do so. I offered the Malaysian prime minister additional maritime surveillance resources which he gratefully accepted."







Earlier, Mr. Abbott said he had not seen any signs the Malaysia Airlines flight carrying 239 people had come close to Australian airspace.







Family members of those missing and countries involved in the search have criticized Malaysia for repeatedly releasing seemingly contradictory or incomplete information.



China's Foreign Ministry Monday urged Malaysia to "immediately" expand and clarify the scope of the search, saying it should provide "more thorough, accurate information to countries participating."



Defense Minister Hishammuddin Monday denied holding back crucial information. He said he would not withhold any details that could help, but that any information released "must be verified by international investigation teams."



Meanwhile, Malaysian investigators are more closely examining the final moments before the plane disappeared from civilian radar.



Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya says the last known message from the cockpit - a calm, "All right, goodnight" - is believed to have come from the plane's co-pilot.



But investigators now say it is not clear whether the radio transmission came before or after a signaling system was partially disabled or switched off, allowing the plane to further avoid detection.



The voice in the cockpit did not mention any trouble on board, suggesting he may have been misleading ground control or acting under coercion by someone familiar with aviation technology.



Authorities are also investigating the pilots and engineers who may have had contact with the plane before it left Kuala Lumpur.



The missing passenger plane was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it disappeared. About two-thirds of the people on board were Chinese. Other passengers included Europeans and Americans.##2556|You are using an older browser version.

The commodity traded at $108.01 at 6:00 GMT on Monday morning, as investors evaluated geopolitical tension in both Ukraine and Libya.

Bloomberg reported that China released data on Monday showing that the nation's exports unexpectedly fell 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier. The figure was far below economists' expectations of a 7.5 percent increase, though some are blaming the country's Lunar New Year holiday for the disparity. The data compounded the already growing worry that the Chinese economy is slowing down as it followed poor PMI data released last week.

However, the ongoing tension in Ukraine kept a floor under Brent prices as Russian forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula over the weekend. Russian forces seized another border post as well as a military airfield over the weekend as pro-Russian leaders moved forward with the country's planned referendum.

Related: Euro Holds On To Strength

Western leaders have said they will not recognize Crimea's independence from Ukraine if the vote does take place on March 16, as it is a direct violation of Ukraine's treaty and international law.

However, the Ukrainian government has more pressing problems as its unpaid bills could leave the country without gas. Gazprom has said it may stop sending gas to Ukraine unless the government is able to pay its debts.

Tension in Libya also supported Brent prices as armed protesters clashed with the nation's government on Sunday over the sale of oil from a rebel held port. Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan warned protesters that the military would bomb a North Korean tanker, which was loaded with $36 million of crude oil if it leaves the county's Es Sider port.##2560|GOP crafts health care alternative

House Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation’s health care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.



The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.



The tenets of the plan –which could expand to include the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations – are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.



But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision.



This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with members outlining the plan, called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,” with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents.



“We’ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, said in an interview. “We’ve got all of these bills out there, so we’re going to take this core of policies and grow from there.”



Democrats dismissed the Republican approach as a purely political gesture ahead of this year’s midterm elections.

A Minnesota-based brewing company has come up with a new delivery system to make its winter lager more accessible during the cold months, delivering beer by drone.

Minnesota residents apparently really love their beer, and one of their local breweries has decided that the cold winter months should not be an impediment in getting a good lager, even if you don't want to go to the store.

After watching a 60 Minutes bit on Amazon's same-day delivery system, which employs drones to get the job done, Minnesota-based brewery Lakemaid has decided that it could use such a delivery system as well. Consequently, the Lakemaid Brewing Company has developed its very own beer-delivery drone.

Lakemaid has posted a video of its successful and interesting project, showing how it delivered a 12-pack of its popular frosty Winter Lager to an ice fishing location near Lake Millie Lacs.

The drone had the 12-pack strapped to it and took off to the delivery spot, successfully carrying its package to the desired destination. The video sparked mixed reactions, however. While some found it very cool and would love to have their beer delivered by a drone, others have expressed concerns regarding privacy, as droned are often used for military surveillance purposes.

Aside from concerned citizens, the FAA is among the most prominent forces against this whole drone delivery project. The FAA has very strict rules when it comes to unmanned flying vehicles, and Lakemaid's effort was deemed illegal, according to a report.

More specifically, the use of delivery drones per se is not illegal, but the FAA's restrictions are quite strict. Drones should not fly over 400 feet high, and should not fly over populated areas, for instance. The devices must weigh less than 55 pounds and can be used for delivery, but not for commercial purposes.

While we're sure it was quite recreational to see a drone deliver a 12-pack of beer, there is a strong commercial factor in this equation. This puts Lakemaid's effort in violation of the FAA's restrictions. Consequently, the brewery has received a cease and desist order from the FAA, citing the violations in question.

As it turns out, beer delivery by drone may not be an option available in the very near future, but you can't say Lakemaid hasn't tried. Moreover, despite all criticism and FAA warnings, Lakemaid surely got some good publicity. Check out the video below to see the brewery's drone in action:

When it comes to retirement, a lot of investors have a specific number in mind that they would need to retire in complete comfort. What many people don't know is how to actually come up with an accurate estimate of how much money you'll actually need. Here's a quick guide to help you get started on your planning.

Estimate your annual expenses

You have probably heard of various estimates on how much of your previous income is needed to maintain a similar lifestyle in retirement, and around 75-85% seems to be the consensus. In other words, if your pre-retirement income is $100,000 per year, expect to draw around $75,000-$85,000 from your investments and other income sources.

However, this is not a one-size-fits-all formula. If you were a big saver in your working life, for instance, you are already used to living on a lower percentage of your salary. If you were paying a mortgage and your home is now paid off, that is an expense that no longer needs to be considered. So, it is very possible that the annual income you'll need in retirement is much lower than you think.

In your pre-retirement planning, it helps to try and eliminate as many expenses as possible before you retire (like a mortgage). Sit down and list all of your monthly expenses and consider how they might change once you retire. For example, if you have a long commute to work, you'll certainly be spending a lot less on gas! Smaller expenses like that can really add up fast.

There have been studies that suggest that post-retirement expenses are not as much as experts think and that overall costs actually decline consistently after retiring. A recent study by the University of Michigan found that post-retirement spending is less than 60% of pre-retirement income, on average, so that is probably a more realistic goal to shoot for.

Don't count on help!

While your expenses may be less than you may think, one thing that you should not count on (especially if you are under 40) is Social Security. The SS program may indeed still be around, but likely at either a lower rate or higher retirement age. If Social Security does in fact still exist when you are ready to retire, it should be a bonus, not a core part of your plan.

The same can be said for employer-sponsored pensions. Pensions are an endangered species, especially in the private sector, and just like Social Security, benefit cuts and/or increased retirement ages are becoming the norm.

How you want to invest

The idea of equating the word "stocks" with "risk" in retirement is a flawed one. Not all stocks are risky and volatile any more than all corporate bonds are perfectly safe. Now, I would stay away from volatile tech companies, but dividend-paying blue chip stocks should always make up a substantial portion of any retirement portfolio.

Bonds can be great for income, but for retirement investors truly in it for the long haul, the concept of "total return" is what will keep your portfolio growing in perpetuity. The S&P 500, for example, has averages a total return (dividends and share price appreciation) of just under 10% since 1926. Depending on the time period, an average of around 3-4% has come from dividend yields (income), with the rest coming from growth.

Is the "4% rule" right for everyone?

The short answer is "no", but it can be a good starting point. The "4% rule" of retirement essentially says that if you withdraw 4% of your retirement portfolio per year and increase your withdrawals with inflation, your account will last for as long as you do.

The 4% rule should work if you have a healthy mix of investments, specifically, at least half of your money in dividend-stocks that will allow your portfolio to appreciate over time. If you decide that you need $60,000 per year in retirement, your "number" would be $1,500,000.

This amount could drop tremendously if you end up getting the same Social Security benefits that are around today or if you actually collect a pension in perpetuity, but as I said before, these situations should be thought of as a bonus, not as a core aspect of your retirement planning.##2564|Colorado Springs, CO (80903)

Copyright: Thomson Reuters 2014##2566|Tropical fruit supplier Fyffes is to merge with US-based rival Chiquita in a deal creating the world’s largest banana company, which will be based in Ireland.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of $4.6bn from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of $3bn and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the North Carolina-based company will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at $526m.

The existing brands will be retained but customers will have access to a more diverse product mix and choice, the two companies said.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the merged business, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

“We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in Ireland and the UK.##2567|Empty##2568|King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of hit mobile phone game "Candy Crush Saga", expects to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.

"Candy Crush," which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King's revenue.

Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at $21-$24 per share, valuing it at up to $7.6 billion - slightly higher than Hasbro Inc, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

"I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.

Twitter's successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc's shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.

However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.

"I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a scepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace," said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

"The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark."

Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.

ANOTHER ZYNGA?

"Candy Crush" launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.

The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra "lives".

Such stellar popularity has helped King's revenue grow to $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.

But most of that growth was fueled by "Candy Crush" rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.

King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $17 billion this year from just $6 billion in 2010.

Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of "Farmville" waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of "Angry Birds".

Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.

To be sure, King's revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined 3 percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in "Candy Crush" gross bookings.

However, bookings rose for its other games such as "Pet Rescue Saga" and "Farm Heroes Saga". About 73 percent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.

King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

"The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent."

NYSE DEBUT

King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26.

Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.

Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company's games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.

JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.

Reuters##2569|Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world's first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn't begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado's pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That's a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado's roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. Statewide liquor receipts for January 2014 were not yet available Monday.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations, though they repeatedly said before the figures were reported that they couldn't guess what tax receipts would be.

Monday's tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.

Gov. John Hickenlooper already has sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.

State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.

"The whole world wants to belly up to this trough," said Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado's budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.

Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world's first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay's marijuana program is still under development.

"Colorado's going to help the nation learn what works and what doesn't," said Pat Oglesby, a former congressional tax staffer who now studies marijuana's tax potential at the Chapel Hill, N.C., Center for New Revenue.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Only 24 recreational pot shops opened Jan. 1.

Oglesby said Colorado's pot sales could grow dramatically in future months as new stores open and marijuana sellers pay more wholesale taxes. Marijuana sellers were allowed a one-time tax-free transfer of medical pot inventory to the recreational market, a caveat that depressed January wholesale tax results.

Colorado's pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state's unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the figure posed to voters. Last year's pot vote guessed that the taxes would produce $70 million a year, and it's unclear what lawmakers can do with tax money that exceeds that figure.

Colorado's Joint Budget Committee plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.

"There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don't think it's going to be that simple," said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and another committee member.

Colorado's 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.

Almost the entire haul from recreational pot came from Denver County, where the industry is concentrated. The second- and third-largest counties for medical marijuana, Boulder and El Paso, had no recreational pot shops operating in January.##2570|Japan has ruled that bitcoin is not legal tender but could still be the subject of taxation and anti money-laundering rules.

Li acknowledged frictions between the world's two biggest economies, but said they shared interests and called for mutual respect of core concerns.

It is only natural that these two countries have some differences and frictions

LI KEQIANG

"Wise people will seek a common interest, while unwise ones will focus on the differences," Li said at the end of the National People's Congress in Beijing.

"As long as the two sides respect each other's core interests and major concerns, properly manage their differences and engage in equal consultations, in particular continuing to expand their converging interests, these two countries will be able to further raise the level of their relationship."

Sino-US ties have been strained in recent years due to territorial disputes between China and its neighbours.

Washington is concerned regional security is threatened by China's increasingly assertive tone over its sovereignty claims in the East China and South China seas. Beijing fears its dominance in the Asia Pacific region will be contained by the US "pivot" towards Asia.

"China and the US are different in history, culture and stage of development," Li said. "So it is only natural that these two countries have some differences and frictions in the course of their co-operation."

Li said President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Barack Obama, had agreed to build a new model for Sino-US ties, and had vowed to avoid confrontation.

"There is much more that we can do to further unleash the potential of Sino-US co-operation," he said.

Li struck a similar tone in assessing China's relationship with Southeast Asian nations. He said Beijing had "an unshakable view in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity" but also stressed it had an "abiding commitment to pursuing peaceful development".

He recalled a local shopowner he met on his visit to Hanoi last year telling him there should be peace between the two nations.

Although Li's portfolio is domestic, his characterisation of foreign relations at the public conference following the wrap of the National People's Congress is closely watched. Last year, he hit out at Washington for making "groundless accusations" against China concerning cybersecurity.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Saturday there was no room for China to compromise on historical and territorial issues.

Sun Zhe, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University, said the premier was attempting to allay fears concerning China's growing assertiveness by stressing peaceful development and co-operation.

Su Hao, a professor with the China Foreign Affairs University, said Li was seeking to strike a balance between acting tough and maintaining a friendly posture. "Too much tough rhetoric may backfire," Su said.##2573|Empty##2574|The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising U.S. interest rates in the third quarter of next year as the unemployment rate falls and the economy charts a new path of stronger growth, a Reuters survey of economists showed.

The U.S. central bank slashed short-term interest rates to a record low close to zero in December 2008 and committed to keep them there while it nursed the economy back to health.

Thirty-two of 63 economists surveyed forecast the Fed hiking overnight rates in either the second or third quarters of 2015, while 14 saw a rate hike coming earlier and six saw it coming later.



Editor’s Note: Get These 4 Stocks Before 399% Stock Market Rally!

Two simply said sometime in 2015. The median forecast pointed to the third quarter.

"You are looking at an unemployment rate that probably gets below 6 percent by the second half of 2015 and that's within a hair's breadth of full employment," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. "It will start to push up wage growth by that period."

The poll forecast the jobless rate averaging 6.4 percent this year. This suggests that as early as the second quarter of this year, the unemployment rate could breach the 6.5 percent level that Fed officials have said would trigger discussions over when to raise interest rates from near zero.

Policymakers, however, have made it clear that interest rates will remain low for a while even if the threshold for the unemployment rate is met and they are considering ways to revamp their forward guidance.

"I think their commitment will be tested. They may start to raise interest rates sooner than the markets expect," said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

The jobless rate was forecast falling to an average of 5.9 percent in 2015. Back in February, it had been estimated averaging 6.6 percent this year and 6.0 percent in 2015. The unemployment rate was at 6.7 percent last month.

In a vote of confidence in the economy, the Fed in December announced plans to scale back the amount of bonds it buys each month to help keep interest rates low, with the expectation it would wind down by the program by year end.

At that meeting, it dropped its purchases to $75 billion from $85 billion. It announced a further $10 billion reduction in January and is expected to announce another similar cut at its March 18-19 policy meeting.

LABOR MARKET SLACK EASING

With slack in the labor market easing, wage growth is expected to accelerate later this year after being largely sluggish since the recovery started almost five years ago. A shortage of skilled workers in some industries is one reason.

The survey forecast nonfarm payrolls averaging 200,000 jobs per month in the second quarter after being held back by an unusually cold winter early in the year. First quarter job growth was forecast averaging 162,000 jobs per month.

However, rising wages probably will not translate into a build-up in inflation as slowing growth in emerging markets puts downward pressure on commodity prices. Anticipated dollar strength is also expected to help curb inflation pressures.

The survey forecast consumer prices, excluding food and energy, staying below the Fed's 2 percent target through 2014.

The core Consumer Price Index was seen averaging 2 percent in the first quarter of 2015 and holding that level for the next two quarters.

Despite a slow start as unusually cold weather took its toll, growth is expected to average 2.7 percent this year, which would be one of the strongest years since 2005 and a noticeable step up from last year's 1.9 percent.

Gross domestic product was forecast expanding at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the second quarter and sustaining that brisk pace for the rest of the year. First-quarter growth was estimated at a 1.9 percent pace. The economy grew at a 2.4 percent rate in the final three months of 2013.

In February's poll, GDP growth had been forecast at a 2.2 percent pace for the first three months of the year and at a 2.8 percent rate for April-June quarter.

Consumers are expected to be the main drivers of growth, emboldened by higher wages, and rising house and stock market prices. The drag from fiscal policy is expected to be lighter this year.

"There is a lot pent-up demand for autos and housing. The financial health of the consumer is in a better position than it has been since the expansion started," said Anderson.

##2578|Empty##2579|In a Goldman Sachs report entitled “All About Bitcoin,” one of the world’s largest financial institutions said that it doesn’t necessarily see bitcoin as a viable, legitimate currency. Instead, it noted that bitcoin will likely become an innovative payments technology.

One particular claim has generated buzz: bitcoin could save consumers, retail merchants and users of money transfer services approximately $200 billion in the global economy. The figure was hypothetically calculated by the institution. This is an immense sum of money and one that could damage conventional payment service providers, such as PayPal, Visa and MasterCard.

The biggest hurdles that bitcoin face are remaining alive and maintaining its innovative status, according to Goldman Sachs. The company says more government, greater regulation, increased operating costs and heightened competition are quite inevitable.

“While it is too early to tell how banks and payment processors will react to the threat of Bitcoin, we believe that it is only a matter of time before major incumbents develop a digital currency strategy,” wrote Roman Leal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs covering information-technology services, in the report.

Although the bitcoin leaders have initiated lobbying efforts in Washington over the past few months, it is still pittance compared to what the credit card and technology industries spend to encourage lawmakers to veer their way on certain pieces of legislation.

Could the $200 billion in savings spell doom for bitcoin? It’s certainly difficult to conclude if the digital currency can defeat efforts to eliminate bitcoin from the economic sphere. Companies like Visa and PayPal have a lot of pull and influence and though it’s unlikely that there will be an outright ban at first, these private enterprises could establish small blockades one step at a time.

“Today the future of the bitcoin is unclear due to the pressure coming from various governments,” said Vladimir Ulyanov, the head of the analytical center of the Zecurion Company. “If in the past the interest towards the bitcoin was growing by the day, today when governments take steps against this system, the prospects of its development and proliferation are a lot weaker.”

Opponents who have been wary of the virtual currency since the beginning have often warned about these very concerns, especially over the past year. Since bitcoin threatens the establishment then the arms of government could very well protect their contributors.

It has become apparent that financial institutions are afraid of bitcoin or any other alternative currency. We reported last month that the Bank of Montreal began shutting down business accounts that were associated with bitcoins. Of course, central banks and other financial entities have issued reports highlighting the risks, volatility and security vulnerabilities of bitcoins as well as spelling out its demise.

Warren Buffett, a friend of big government and the status quo, recently came out (a few times) against bitcoin. He urged investors to “stay away” because it’s a “mirage.”##2580|Empty##2581|(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.

Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.

The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.

“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.

“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.

Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.

Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.

Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.

Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.

Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.

Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.

The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.

Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.

It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.

Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.

When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.

He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.

Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.

The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.##2582|Empty##2583|King, the British computer games maker behind Candy Crush Saga, is seeking to raise up to $530m (£319m) in an initial public offering that would value the company at up to $7.6bn.

The company said in filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it will offer 15.5m shares for between $21 and $24 a piece when it floats on the New York Stock Exchange. Its investors, who include private equity firms Index Ventures and Apax, will sell an additional 6.7m shares.

Those figures put King’s valuation even higher than the $5bn previously forecast , and are likely to stoke fears that it is stretching its ambitions too far.

The company, which was founded in 2003, has enjoyed a surged in growth over the last few years. Its revenues have grown from $64m in 2011 to $1.9bn last year – equivalent to $2.7m per employee - whilst it has turned a pre-tax loss of $698,000 into a $714.3m profit.

The mere fact it is profitable gives it a huge advantage over many other technology companies such as Twitter, which went public despite the fact it is loss-making.

However, King’s IPO documents also reveal a heavy dependence on Candy Crush Saga, which is likely to unsettle investors.

The game, in which players look for patterns in coloured digital jewels, drove 78pc of all of King’s revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013, as some 93m people logged in to play each day.

Its phenomenal success has echoes of Farmville, the Facebook game made by King’s rival, Zynga, and which generated a frenzy of excitement around the company ahead of its flotation in 2011. However, Zynga’s value quickly fell to around a third of its IPO price, as the company struggled to produce another hit of the same scale.

Analysts have said that IPO investors were still “haunted” by the ghost of Zynga, and that they now regarded the whole mobile gaming sector as “untouchable”.

“King simply must create multi-decade franchises around characters that last for generations - not for fortnights - before they can have a successful IPO at the valuation they want,” Sam Hamadeh, founder of the research firm, PrivCo, said just before King made its documents public last month.

King has admitted that it is vulnerable to some of the same problems as Zynga, noting in its pre-IPO documents that it makes 95pc of its revenues from just three titles – Candy Crush, Pret Rescue Saga and farm Heroes Saga.

However, co-founder and chief executive Riccardo Zacconi also argued that it has a “low-cost, low-risk process” for developing new games, which mean King is well-equipped for “the long haul”.

He and other members of King’s executive team own around a third of the company. Apax is King’s largest shareholder with a 48.2pc stake, whilst Index owns 8.3pc.

However, he is not the biggest individual shareholder on the King team. The company’s longstanding chairman, Melvyn Morris, a 58 year-old British entrepreneur who has built and sold a string of companies, owns 12.2pc of the business. King's co-founder John Sebastian Knuttson is also a major stakeholder, with 5.9pc of the company, while Stephane Kurgan, its chief operating officer, holds 2.5pc.##2584|Empty##2585|New York, NY Further to a recent massive Further to a recent massive General Motors recall involving certain model year 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, and 2007 Pontiac G5 vehicles, at least one family who lost a child as a result of the defect is suing GM.

The recall involves over 748,024 model year 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR and Pontiac Solstice vehicles and 2003-2007 Saturn Ion vehicles and 2007 Saturn Sky vehicles. But GM’s actions are eight years too late for Doug Weigel who lost his teenage daughter as a result of a related car accident. In 2006, 18-year old Natasha Weigel and her friend, Amy Rademaker,15, were riding in a 2005 Chevy Cobalt, one of GM’s recently recalled vehicles, when the car suddenly lost power and crashed into trees on a rural Wisconsin road. Amy died nearly five hours after the accident, but Natasha lay in a coma for 11 days before dying."I'd go to work every day, smile and then I'd get in my car to go home and start bawling," Weigel told. At the time of his daughter's death he was in the Army and months away from deployment. "I have been at terms with it for a long time. I've been OK, but now this comes."The defect that’s prompted the recall involves allegedly faulty ignition switches that can suddenly turn the engine off and disable the airbags. According tothis defect has so far killed 13 people and caused 31 crashes. Adding insult to injury, GM has reportedly known of the defect since 2004, but failed to initiate a recall until February 2014, a full decade later.With the Weigel accident, a crash-investigation team was commissioned by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), who wanted specifics. They found that at 7:55 p.m., the Cobalt veered off the road doing 71 mph, vaulted a driveway and flew 59 feet before clipping a utility box on the ground and slamming into a grove of trees at about 55 mph,reports.Then, in 2007, the investigators reported that, according to the car's data recorder, the ignition switch was in the "accessory" position instead of "run," and the front airbags didn't deploy. It also noted that there were several complaints in NHTSA's database about ignition switch problems.Prior to GM issuing the February recall, the automaker had maintained that the cars involved were safe because they could be steered and stopped. But for some families this remains to be proven and for anyone whose lost a loved one, like the Weigels, the recall comes too late.##2586|Empty##2587|LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — City Attorney Mike Feuer Friday announced a $10 million lawsuit against Time Warner Cable, alleging the media company refused to pay fees.

Starting March 17, Chinese banks can exchange the yuan in the foreign exchange spot market at 2 percent above or below the central parity against the U.S. dollar announced by the China Foreign Exchange Trading System each trading day, according to the statement from the People's Bank of China (PBoC).

The move will enhance the floating flexibility of the renminbi exchange rate and improve the efficiency of capital allocation, facilitating economic restructuring and beefing up the decisive role of the market in allocating resources, the PBOC said in a statement on its website.

China takes a gradual and steady pace in raising its currency's daily trading limit, from 0.3 percent in 1994 to 0.5 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2012 to the latest 2 percent.

"The widening is within rational range and is a tentative step towards the liberalization of the yuan's exchange rate," said Yi Xianrong, a senior financial researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

The widening of the band came after the Chinese yuan's continued weakening against U.S.dollar from mid February to early march, which caused widespread concerns over its domestic and international impacts to trade and the financial sector.

The change will not lead to steep depreciation of the Chinese yuan, the statement said, citing improving balance of payments and rich foreign exchange deposit.

"The recent fluctuation of the yuan's exchange rate prompted the expansion of its trading band," said Tan Yaling, president of the China Forex Investment Research Institute.

"It will further drive away speculators betting on a one-way appreciation of the Chinese yuan thanks to the possible bigger and more frequent exchange rate fluctuations due to the widening," Tan said.

The central bank respects the market rule and their reactions and maily focuses on mid-term changes of the yuan's exchange rate, Zhou Xiaochuan,governor of PBoC said last week during a press conference of China's annual parliamentary meetings.

The change is expected to prompt enterprises and residents to pay more attention to the exhange rate's role in allocating market resources,according to the statement.

"Enterprises may have a difficult time dealing with the change at the beginning as the fluctuation risk is left to the market instead of being taken care by the central bank," said Cao Honghui, a senior researcher with China Development Bank.

They should learn to leave the comfort zone and grow more resilient to market risks, Cao said.

Meanwhile, the change also calls for more diversified foreign exchange products to hedge against possible risks brought by more volatility in the yuan's exhange rate, Cao added.

PBoC will further push the liberalization of yuan's exhange rate and diversify foreign exchange products to build a market-guided and properly regulated floating exchange rate system, the statement added.

China reported a large trade deficit in February mainly due to distortion by the Chinese New Year holidays, marking the first deficit since April 2013, customs data showed last week.

The next move should send a clear message to enterprises that there is no one-way appreciation and prompt them to adjust and reform themselves to deal with a market-based exchange rate, Yi said.

Enterprises and financial institutions may go through some short-term pain dealing with more market risks, but they will gain in the long term with the gradual exchange rate liberalization due to enhanced global competitiveness, Yi added.##2596|Empty##2597|Bloomberg

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (阿里巴巴), China’s biggest e-commerce company, will begin the process of filing for an initial public offering in the US that may be the biggest since Facebook Inc.

The announcement comes after Alibaba struggled to persuade Hong Kong regulators to approve a proposed governance structure that would allow its partners to nominate a majority of its board of directors. The company is open to listing in China “should circumstances permit in the future,” the company said.

Investment banks have valued Alibaba, founded by former English teacher Jack Ma (馬雲), at as much as US$200 billion, which would make it the second-biggest Internet company behind Google Inc based on market capitalization. A US share sale by Alibaba would be a blow to Hong Kong, which has not hosted an IPO of more than US$4 billion since October 2010.

“Alibaba from day one has been based around making money, and it’s a real Chinese Internet success story,” said Mark Tanner, the founder of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based research and marketing agency. “Alibaba is huge now, but will just continue to get a lot bigger.”

The IPO is codenamed “Avatar,” two people familiar with the matter have said.

An Alibaba IPO could raise about HK$100 billion (US$12.9 billion), Ernst & Young LLP said on June 28 last year. That would make it the world’s biggest first-time share offering since Facebook raised US$16 billion in May last year, and Hong Kong’s largest since AIA Group Ltd’s US$20 billion sale in October 2010, Bloomberg data showed.

Alibaba’s expansion since Ma started the company in his Hangzhou apartment in 1999 with two dozen items for sale, mirrors China’s emergence as an economic superpower.

The company had about 25,000 employees at the end of last month and generated about 70 percent of package deliveries in China in 2012. Customers bought 35 billion yuan (US$5.7 billion) of goods on one sales promotion day via Alibaba’s two main platforms last year.

The success has made Ma, 49, one of China’s richest people, with an estimated net worth of US$11.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

There is still room for growth. China has 618 million Internet users, greater than the population of any other country except India, and McKinsey & Co estimates China’s Internet retail market will triple to US$395 billion from 2011 to next year.

Analyst valuations of Alibaba rose 28 percent after the earnings, with the company worth US$153 billion, according to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg News last month.

Macquarie Group Ltd estimated Alibaba could be worth US$200 billion, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc in a Jan. 29 report put the company’s value at about US$150 billion.

Google has a market capitalization of US$400 billion, Amazon US$171 billion and Facebook, US$175 billion, according to Bloomberg data.##2598|PTI By

In yet another blow to the Indian pharmaceutical sector, the US Food and Drug Administration has banned import of drugs from Sun Pharma's Karkhadi facility in Gujarat for violation of manufacturing norms.

"This import alert was issued by the USFDA as a follow up to the last inspection of the facility, during which some non-compliance of current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations were identified," Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said in a statement.

The company remains fully committed to compliance and has already initiated several corrective steps to address the observations made by the USFDA, it added.

Sun Pharma, which is lndia's biggest drugmaker by value, said the import ban would have negligible affect on the company's revenues.

"The contribution of this facility to Sun Pharma's consolidated revenues is negligible. Sun Pharma maintains its FY 2013-14 consolidated sales growth guidance," it said.

The company's Karkhadi facility manufactures antibiotics and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The company has 10 manufacturing sites in India.

According to the information available on USFDA website, an import alert enables 'detention without physical examination of drugs from firms which have not met drug manufacturing norms'.

Earlier this week, Sun Pharma had voluntarily recalled 2,528 bottles of its generic version of diabetes drug Glumetza in the US market on the basis of a customer complaint.

USFDA has been cracking down heavily for non-compliance of manufacturing norms and various facilities of companies like Ranbaxy and Wockhardt have already been banned from importing drugs into the US market.

While all plants of Daiichi Sankyo controlled Ranbaxy Laboratories in India have been banned from exporting drugs to the US, Wockhardt has also faced similar actions on its two plants in the country.

Reacting to the development, the Sun Pharma scrip had tanked as much as 6.5 per cent. In the afternoon trade, however, it was down 3.91 per cent at Rs 580.40 on the BSE.##2599|Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN) reported net income for the fourth quarter of $88.68 million or $0.59 per share, up from $82.55 million or $0.56 per share in the year-ago quarter.

Total net sales for the fourth quarter rose 6 percent to $905.86 million from $856.83 million in the same quarter last year.

On average, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn $0.55 per share for the quarter on revenue of $927.86 million.

Looking ahead, Richard Hayne, Chief Executive Officer of Urban Outfitters said, "Looking forward, customer reaction to the new spring fashion offerings at our Anthropologie and Free People brands have been strong, but given the continued challenges facing the Urban Outfitters brand, we remain very cautious about URBN's first quarter performance."

Business News##2600|Empty##2601|The alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets is "as serious as" the Libor rate rigging scandal that rocked the financial sector, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said.

"This is extremely serious... this is as serious as Libor, if not more so, because this goes to the heart of the integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets," Carney told British lawmakers.

Global regulators are investigating a number of firms linked to the suspected rigging of foreign exchange trading.

The probe comes on the heels of the Libor interbank interest rate-rigging scandal of 2012 that triggered heavy fines for major international banks and a boardroom shake-up at British banking giant Barclays.

Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland have all confirmed that they are part of the ongoing forex market investigations.

Deutsche Bank, Swiss lender UBS and US pair Citi and JPMorgan Chase have also revealed that they are co-operating with regulators over the affair.

Some lenders have meanwhile suspended and fired traders while investigations continue.

"We are taking this very seriously... what we have to do is re-establish the principles of fair markets so that people in these markets know how to behave and do so," Carney added.

The Bank of England was working with other major central banks to establish what happened and help fix the market infrastructure. The findings would then be presented to the leaders of G20, he added.

In a major overhaul, Carney revealed that the BoE will appoint a new deputy governor to focus on financial markets and banking. It will also press ahead with plans to beef up internal regulations.

"This is important to the FX (foreign exchange) market and to the integrity of the Bank of England," Canadian national Carney added.

"We owe it to the people of this country, to parliament, and to our employees, who have acted with integrity and a spirit of public service.

"We can't come out of this with a shadow of doubt about the integrity of the Bank of England. The institution has to be beyond reproach."

The Bank of England chief made the comments in a regular appearance before parliament's influential Treasury Select Committee to explain the central bank's most recent quarterly economic forecasts, but was also grilled over the growing forex rigging scandal.

The BoE had revealed last week that it had suspended a worker following a review of its processes triggered by a probe into suspected forex rigging.

The central bank has found no evidence that staff colluded in the alleged manipulation of the forex trades, 40 percent of which are conducted in London.

"We have no information that suggests that anyone at the Bank of England condoned manipulation of the market, facilitated (or) participated in market manipulation," Carney repeated today.

Meanwhile, Mr Carney also signalled he was not concerned that Britain's economy was close to overheating, despite a strong recovery since last year, putting himself in the dovish camp among policymakers.

He said the amount of spare capacity in the economy was probably slightly more than 1.5% of GDP.

This suggests that the BoE can hold off on raising interest rates for longer.

Mr Carney also said Britain's natural rate of unemployment could be less than the Bank has estimated, meaning the labour market can strengthen further without pushing up inflation.##2602|Empty##2603|This will appear next to all of your comments

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 entered its 11th day Monday, saddled with the growing weight of disparate and sometimes conflicting theories as to what might have happened and where the plane might be.

Search crews from 26 nations scoured vast swaths of ocean and land for any trace of the airliner, which vanished March 8 on a flight between Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Beijing.

They've turned up nothing.

Meanwhile, families struggle with the unknown.

"Surely, they must find the plane. That's all I hope for," said Gurusamy Subramaniam, whose son, Puspanathan, is among the missing. "The whole world is out looking for it."

And suggestions about what might have happened to the Boeing 777-200ER continue to multiply, drawing pleas from Malaysian officials to put an end to the theorizing.

"This is why we press on everybody not to speculate," said Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's civil aviation chief. "Because when we have to look into speculative reports, it will distract us from our immediate concern, which is to find the aircraft."

Here are the latest developments in the search and investigation:

Flight evaded radar?

On Monday, the Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times reported that the plane may have flown low to the ground -- 5,000 feet or less -- and used mountainous terrain as cover to evade radar detection. The newspaper cited unnamed sources for its reporting, which CNN could not immediately confirm.

However, Malaysian officials said Monday that they were not aware of the report.

"It does not come from us," said Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya.

Analysts interviewed by CNN said that it would be extremely difficult to fly such a large aircraft so close to the ground over a long period of time and that it's not even clear that doing so would keep the plane off radar scopes.

"Five thousand isn't really low enough to evade the radar, and that's kind of where general aviation flies all the time anyway, and we're visible to radar," said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Timeline clarification

Ahmad Jauhari said Monday that it wasn't clear whether the final words from the cockpit came before or after the plane's data-reporting system was shut down. Earlier, Malaysian authorities had said the message "All right, good night" came after the system had been disabled.

The voice message came at 1:19 a.m. Saturday, March 8, Ahmad Jauhari said. The data system sent its last transmission at 1:07 a.m. and was shut down sometime between then and 1:37 a.m. that day, Ahmad Jauhari said.

Indian radar

A senior Indian military official told CNN on Monday that military radar near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands isn't as closely watched as other radar systems. That leaves open the possibility that Indian radar systems may not have picked up the airplane at the time of its last known Malaysian radar contact, near the tiny island of Palau Perak in the Straits of Malacca.

Earlier speculation had centered on the idea the plane may have flown over, or perhaps even landed in, the islands, but no trace of it has been found in the region despite intensive searches by Indian military officials.

Chinese response

China said Monday that it had deployed 10 ships, 21 satellites and multiple aircraft to aid in the search. Premier Li Keqiang spoke with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to ask for more information to help speed the search along, according to a statement posted on the Chinese government website.

U.S. Navy pulls out destroyer

The USS Kidd and its helicopters have stopped combing the Andaman Sea and are no longer part of search efforts for the missing plane, the Navy said. No debris or wreckage from a plane was found.

The move is partially because Australians are taking over the majority of the searching in that area, U.S. officials said. A U.S. P-8 aircraft will move to Perth, Australia, to be based there for searching.

Fewer U.S. assets will be involved in the search for the missing plane, but U.S. officials said the P-8 will be able to cover a wider range of ocean more quickly than the ship could.

"This is actually much more effective for the overall search," Cmdr. William Marks of the U.S. 7th Fleet told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Monday.

"The real challenge is this huge expanse of water. I keep saying, if you superimposed a map of the U.S. on here, it'd be like trying to find someone anywhere between New York and California. so that's the challenge here," he said. "We have amazing, dedicated air crews. it's just a matter of how much area we can search."

Why am I seeing this 'Under Construction' page?##2607|ADVERTISEMENT

Time Warner Cable Inc. has stirred anger over its hike in subscription rates for customers and its efforts to extract hefty fees from rivals to air the L.A. Dodgers channel.

Now it has incurred the wrath of city officials.

On Friday, the city of Los Angeles sued the cable giant, alleging it stiffed the city on franchise fees over four years through 2011. The city seeks nearly $10 million in fees, money it said could have helped ease its budget problems during the financial crisis.

“Time Warner owes L.A.’s taxpayers millions of dollars for the privilege of having its franchise,” City Attorney Michael Feuer said during a City Hall news conference announcing the lawsuit. “This is a day where we are standing up and saying enough is enough.”

The 24-page lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, contends that Time Warner Cable “blatantly refused to live up to its obligations to the city” to pay franchise fees to operate its cable network over city-owned rights of way while collecting more than $500 million a year from customers in the city.

Feuer said the city has been negotiating with Time Warner Cable for several years.

“The negotiations haven’t been fruitful and we have to do something about that,” Feuer said. “Time Warner pocketed the money from its subscribers and then did not turn it over to the city of Los Angeles.”

The city contends that Time Warner Cable owes $9.7 million in fees, money that Feuer said could have been used to hire 100 police officers and make sidewalk repairs.

Time Warner Cable, in a statement, denied the allegation that it had cheated the city.

“As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen,” the company said in a statement. “We are disappointed the city has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit.”

The lawsuit contends that Time Warner Cable owed $2.5 million in franchise fees and public, education and governmental channel fees in 2008 and 2009 and an additional $7.2 million in fees in 2010 and 2011.

The city contends that once in 2008 and again in 2011, Time Warner Cable withheld more than $5 million in fees the city said it was owed. The company finally paid a portion of the disputed fees, Feuer said, but then subtracted the same amount from its franchise fee payment, resulting in another underpayment.

The lawsuit comes just a few weeks after Time Warner Cable alerted its Southern California customers that it planned to hike rates by an average of about 6% a month for homes that are not covered by a promotional package.

The higher bills, which are expected to affect about 30% of its estimated 1.5 million customers in the region, kick in this month. The company said higher fees are needed to pay for rising programming costs and technical upgrades to the company’s system.

Meantime, Time Warner Cable has been playing hardball with DirecTV, Dish Network, Charter Communications, AT&T Inc.’s U-Verse, Cox Communications and Verizon Communications Inc.’s FiOS over terms to carry the new Los Angeles Dodgers channel.

The new channel launched on Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems late last month. However, most other pay TV distributors have been balking at the terms for providing the channel, contending that Time Warner Cable is demanding fees that are too high.

Until this season, Dodgers games were available in Los Angeles on local television station KCAL-TV Channel 9 and Fox’s Prime Ticket regional sports cable network.

But for the first time in the team’s history, none of the team’s games will be available on free, over-the-air television. Fans must subscribe to a pay-TV service if they want to watch the Dodgers. So far, only Time Warner Cable and Bright House have the channel.

Time Warner Cable agreed to an $8.35 billion, 25-year deal with the Dodgers’ organization for the rights to distribute the channel, called SportsNet LA.

The carrier has been asking other distributors for more than $4 a month per subscriber, meaning the channel would cost their customers at least $50 a year — regardless of whether those viewers watched the Dodgers.

Last summer, a contract dispute between Time Warner Cable and CBS Corp. resulted in a month-long blackout of KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KCAL-TV Channel 9 for customers of the cable company.

The city’s lawsuit stems from its authority to charge cable companies franchise fees of 5% of a cable operators’ gross revenues, in lieu of rent for the public right-of-way to install and maintain the company’s wires and cable boxes.

The city also assesses fees to help pay for public, educational and governmental channels. Cable operators were required to pay fees to help support government and public access TV channels, including the construction and operation of TV studios. Cable subscribers receive those channels as part of their packages.##2608|We attempted to send a notification to your email address but we were unable to verify that you provided a valid email address.

His comments came as the bank announced two new deputy governors, Monetary Policy Commitee (MPC) member Ben Broadbent and International Monetary Fund official Nemat Shafik, shaking up the top rank of the bank.

Broadbent will succeed Charlie Bean as deputy governor responsible for monetary policy in July, while Shafik will take on the newly created role of deputy governor for markets and banking from the beginning of August.

Both deputy governors will sit on the BoE's rate-setting MPC, with Shafik taking the seat currently held by the BoE's executive director for markets, Paul Fisher. The new position, will take the number of deputy governors to four.

(Read more: Carney: Strategic shake-up at Bank of England )

Shafik, who has been the IMF's deputy managing director since April 2011,will be the first female MPC member since 2010.

The BoE also announced Andy Haldane, currently the BoE's executive director for financial stability, as its chief economist from June. He will replace Spencer Dale who will take on a similar role to Haldane's current position and will leave the Monetary Policy Committee, the BoE said.

Posen, currently the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said the shake up of the Bank of England is only helpful if it also "embodies" a change in mindset.

"Its really not an organizational problem. To me it's a problem of they just have the wrong values," Posen told CNBC.

(Read more: Forex manipulation: How it worked )

"There was too much faith by self-regulation by the market. There was too much faith in these cosy relations. Carney can change the institutional structure, but I am hoping what is behind it is that is to embody the new mindset. If he just changes the institutions and remains this sort of laissez faire, then we got a problem," he said.

Until recently Fisher - who is executive director, markets - would have been an obvious candidate for the new position which covers much of his current job, albeit with expanded responsibilities and at one level higher in the BoE hierarchy.

(Read more: Bank of England employee suspended over forex probe )

But following the BoE's suspension of an employee this month in an internal investigation into whether staff turned a blind eye to signs of manipulation of London's $2.1 trillion-a-day currency market, the appointment of Fisher to the new role was thrown into question.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Fisher, who was previously the suspended employee's manager, but he came under fire last week from a parliamentary committee over his role in supervising currency markets.

Posen said in his opinion four deputy governors was too many, but he defended Fisher, instead blaming the supervision culture at the bank.

"Paul Fisher, I can say 100 percent is not corrupt in anyway, I worked with him for three years, he is a great person. But that question of the general supervisory culture at the bank, that we let those fixes go on, that we don't do things in open markets - that we have all these side conversations - that is what has to change, have a different mindset," he said.

Fisher's term on the Monetary Policy Committee - where he was one of the stronger supporters of more stimulus for Britain's economy after the financial crisis - ends in May.

Fisher has said he first heard of the currency accusations only last October, and that the alleged collusion by market-makers under investigation now was different from less serious discussions about hedge funds' activity as far back as 2006.

(Read more: Bank of England holds rates as pressure mounts )

Carney said the creation of the new role was not a response to the inquiry, but whoever fills it will conduct "a root and branch review of how we conduct market intelligence".

Former Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance said he feared the new deputy governor might be given no real authority. "In my experience, all important decisions in the Bank are taken by and announced by the governor," he said.

Reuters contributed to this report##2610|Demand for inflation linked bond securities and various types of inflation protection are on the increase, as investor expectations of US inflation hit all-time highs.



Since the beginning of the year, a steady stream of economic news has sharpened investor concerns about the threat of inflation. This data includes increased wage growth, a rebound in the labor market and higher energy prices. These economic metrics indicate growth; they also mean that as the economy improves companies will more easily pass on increased costs.



In fact, investor expectations for inflation over the next five years, as measured by comparing yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasury bonds, known as the break-even, have hit a new high in their long-term average, at 1.97, and a daily market high on March 13 of 1.86 (See Chart A), levels not seen in a year.

Chart A: US Inflation Expectations are on the Rise





Created with Y Charts



Furthermore, the intraday price on five-year inflation expectations rose briefly above 2 percent in early March for the first time in seven months, after a report showed the economy added more jobs than forecast in February, according to Bloomberg data.



Break-even inflation is the difference between the nominal yield on a fixed-rate investment and the real yield (fixed spread) on an inflation-linked investment of similar maturity and credit quality. If inflation averages more than the break-even, the inflation-linked investment will outperform the fixed-rate. Conversely, if inflation averages below the break-even, the fixed-rate will outperform the inflation-linked.



Meanwhile, the high demand for TIPS indicates investors believe the market is underpricing future inflation. In early March, funds that invest in TIPS took in a net of $359 million, the largest weekly inflow since May 2012, according to EPFR Global. This is the first gain since last April, when Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke’s stimulus tapering caused an initial sell-off as investors repositioned their portfolios out of a fear that the economy was weak.



The Data Driving Expectations



Since the beginning of the year, several positive economic reports have bolstered the Federal Reserve’s contention that the economy has been improving and no longer needs stimulus. However, the improvement in economic growth also suggests the central bank’s efforts have been successful in spurring inflation to achieve its stated goal of reduced unemployment.



Below, we take a look at the numbers behind energy prices, unemployment, wage gains, and consumer confidence to more closely discern the underlying fundamentals that are driving investors’ new inflation expectations.



Energy Prices on the Rise



The single biggest new development that has prompted investors to seek inflation protection this year has been the steady increase in energy prices.



This is a state of affairs that will likely continue, according to Robert Rapier, chief investment strategist at Investing Daily’s The Energy Strategist, our sister publication. Rapier argues that natural gas prices will remain at elevated levels after demand increased for natural gas as a result of the arctic weather that blasted the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states.



Rapier makes the case for why oil has been stubbornly high and will continue:



“In a nutshell, it’s the demand side of the equation keeping pace with the growing supply. Over the past decade, demand in the US and the EU fell, but this was more than compensated for by growing demand in developing countries. This kept the price of oil high, despite supply/demand fundamentals that in isolated countries would have encouraged lower prices.”



But the world’s oil markets aren’t local. And now demand in the US is starting to regain strength, recently rising to the highest level since 2008, he argues.



The International Energy Agency has estimated that global demand for oil will increase this year by 1.2 million barrels a day. For perspective, over the past five years the world has increased oil production by nearly 3.9 million barrels (2 million of which was from the US) — an average increase each year of 770,000 barrels per year. “I believe the long-term direction for both commodities [natural gas and oil] is inevitably higher prices,” Rapier concludes.



Unemployment and Wage Gains



As my Inflation Survival Letter colleague Benjamin Shepherd identified last week in his analysis entitled, “The Mixed Picture on Jobs,” the economy added 175,000 new jobs last month and a more-than-expected 129,000 in December, but the unemployment rate actually ticked up from 6.6 percent in January to 6.7 percent in February.



To explain this ostensible discrepancy, Shepherd points to analysis by HSBC as to how inflation becomes increasingly unpredictable after the official unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, with inflation about as likely to go up as to go down.



We have long contended (and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has acknowledged) that one of the challenges of the central bank is identifying the number of unemployed to gauge its monetary policy. The headline number, many have argued, does not seem to be representative of what is going on in the real economy, given the high numbers of long-term unemployed that are failing to be counted. This oversight increases the chances that the Federal Reserve will fail to time its stimulus and contain inflation.



Responding to the higher rate of unemployment that was reported, Vice Chair Stanley Fischer, the nominee to be Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s top lieutenant, asserted on March 13 that the US economy still needs unprecedented accommodation amid high joblessness.



“At 6.7 percent, the unemployment rate remains too high,” Fischer said in remarks prepared for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.



The number of people who applied for US unemployment benefits fell by 9,000 to 315,000 in the week ended March 8, marking the lowest level since the end of November, the US Labor Department reported. Economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal’s MarketWatch expected claims to total 330,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. The average of new claims over the past month, a more reliable gauge than the volatile weekly number, declined by 6,250 to 330,500. That’s the lowest level since early December and a reminder that, though sluggish, the economy is improving.



Meanwhile, between discussions of raising the minimum wage and new indications of wage growth, many investors are watching these developments closely and forming new inflation expectations.



The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported average weekly earnings rose 0.3 percent in March from a year ago, using the data from the consumer prices report to adjust for inflation. That’s a static growth rate but wages overall are up since the recession’s start. They’re down from the end of 2008, broadly flat over the past decade, and on an inflation-adjusted basis, wages peaked in 1973, fully 40 years ago. Regardless of these fluctuations, the wage trend points to continued economic recovery.



Consumer Spending on the Rise



Consumer confidence rose last week to the second-highest level since August, as Americans grew more upbeat about the economy. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index climbed to minus 27.6 in the period that ended March 9 from minus 28.5 the prior week. The advance was the fifth straight and the reading was second only to the minus 27.4 in the week ended Dec. 22, which was the strongest since mid-August.



Consumers surveyed were more optimistic about the economy than at any time in the last seven months, reflecting stocks near record highs and a labor market that’s showing signs of improving, according to Bloomberg. At the same time, “discussions about raising the minimum wage are probably helping lift spirits at the bottom of the income scale,” the Bloomberg report surmised. This improvement in consumer confidence was also confirmed by the widely watched University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey.



The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of sentiment rose to 81.6 last month from 81.2 in January. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for the measure to hold at its preliminary reading of 81.2. Sustained sentiment indicates spending may pick up after bad winter weather across much of the US caused some Americans to stay close to home rather than shop at the mall.



Furthermore, the Michigan sentiment survey’s index of expectations six months from now increased to a six-month high of 72.7 from 71.2 last month. The preliminary reading was 73. The gauge of current conditions, which measures Americans’ view of their personal finances, dropped to 95.4 in February from 96.8 a month earlier. The initial reading for February was 94.



Another report from the US Commerce Department in late February showed the economy expanded in the fourth quarter at a 2.4 percent annual rate, slower than initially estimated.



The upshot: The seeds have been planted for higher inflation and you should get ready now.

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — Comcast Corp. has long been a big player in Washington, DC, working to expand its influence among lawmakers as it increases its industry footprint across the country.

Comcast says that for its business and its customers, it’s critical for the company to be part of the political process.

But public interest groups say the company’s donations to politicians buys Comcast inside access to help it survive government scrutiny over its bid for Time Warner Cable.

Comcast certainly is allowed to make donations, acknowledges Politico technology reporter Tony Romm, “and it gives this money to plenty of members, both parties, both houses of Congress, even up to the White House.”

Romm says Comcast’s political action committee gave cash to all but three of the 18 US senators on the Judiciary Committee (including Sen. Chris Coons,D-Del). That’s the panel holding a hearing into the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal later this month.

“Members of Congress say that those campaign checks don’t affect their judgement one way or the other. Open government experts, however, think that when you have that much money in politics and it’s coming so often from one company, it’s hard for lawmakers to look at things objectively,” notes Romm.

Meanwhile, opponents of the big cable merger say they have nowhere near the resources to fight a lobbying campaign on Comcast’s level — one seen just a few years ago as the company locked up its purchase of NBC Universal.

What you need to know to start your day with all the latest industry developments##2616|The maker of Candy Crush Saga, the hugely popular puzzle game, said yesterday that it hopes to raise as much as $532.8 million in its initial public offering, valuing the company at nearly $7.6 billion.

The maker of Candy Crush Saga, the hugely popular puzzle game, said yesterday that it hopes to raise as much as $532.8 million in its initial public offering, valuing the company at nearly $7.6 billion.

In a revised prospectus, the company, King Digital Entertainment, said it planned to price its shares at $21 to $24 apiece. At the midpoint of that range, the company would raise $499.5 million and be valued at roughly $7.1 billion.

Should demand prove higher than expected, the game developer�s underwriters can sell additional shares in what is known as a greenshoe option, pushing the maximum size of the offering up to $612 million.

If King sells its shares at the top of its expected range, then investors would value King roughly 54 percent more than they do Zynga, the last mobile-game giant to go public. And its market value would be only $2 billion less than that of Electronic Arts, the longtime veteran of the video-game industry.

That would be a testament to the meteoric success of Candy Crush Saga, which draws an average of 97 million users every day trying to line up three pieces of matching virtual sugar.

But King�s disclosures have led many analysts to question whether the game-maker can continue to thrive as a public company once its biggest hit begins to fade in popularity. Its second most popular hit, Farm Heroes Saga, counts an average of 20 million active users a day.

The company plans to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol KING.##2617|Empty##2618|All ArticlesMORE BY THIS AUTHOR

A whole range of top ECB officials – from President Mario Draghi to chief economist Peter Praet and the newest executive board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger – have felt compelled to defend the decision not to ease monetary conditions any further, despite an alarmingly low level of inflation.



Draghi also insisted that the ECB had been preparing "additional nonstandard monetary policy measures" and would take "decisive action" if needed.

...##2625|Empty##2626|U.S. stocks erased losses, after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index had its biggest decline in a week Tuesday, as investors watched developments in Ukraine and weighed prospects for global economic growth.

Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold climbed more than 2.6 percent as gold jumped. EPL Oil & Gas surged 29 percent after Energy XXI (Bermuda) agreed to buy it for $1.5 billion. Herbalife lost 7.4 percent as it disclosed the Federal Trade Commission has started a civil probe into its practices. PulteGroup and Toll Brothers slipped after Credit Suisse Group downgraded the shares.

The S&P 500 rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,868.20 at 4 p.m. in New York, after declining as much as 0.7 percent earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 11.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,340.08. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 3 percent less than the three-month average.

“We saw a pretty healthy sell-off based on China slowdown fears and potential Russian expansion,” Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said by phone. “The concerns of what’s going on are still on the minds of investors and they’re putting money into safe haven assets like U.S. Treasuries and gold. On the other hand, we’re seeing stocks aren’t completely out of the picture.”

The S&P 500 declined 0.5 percent Tuesday as commodity shares slumped with copper and oil prices amid concern over China’s economy. China announced an economic growth target of 7.5 percent last week, the weakest since 1990, and had its first onshore bond default after a solar-panel maker failed to make an interest payment.

China Data

The nation, the biggest consumer of everything from copper to soybeans, is scheduled to release industrial output data Thursday after reports over the weekend showed the steepest drop in exports since 2009.

In a meeting with the Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk today, Barack Obama called Russia’s incursion into Crimea a violation of international law and said the U.S. stands with Ukraine to protect its sovereignty and territory.

Ukraine warned Russia is amassing troops near its border as Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk visited Washington to step up the search for financial aid. Yatsenyuk met President Barack Obama today, and addresses the United Nations Security Council in New York tomorrow. Obama called Russia’s incursion into Crimea a violation of international law and said the U.S. stands with Ukraine to protect its sovereignty and territory.

Ukraine Crisis

Russia’s takeover of Crimea, home to its Black Sea Fleet, has sparked the worst crisis with the West since the Cold War as the European Union and the U.S. try to use sanctions to force President Vladimir Putin to retreat.

“Investors are keeping an eye on what’s happening with Ukraine and Russia,” said Christian Zogg, who manages about $540 million as head of equity and fixed income at LLB Asset Management in Vaduz, Liechtenstein. “After the good fourth-quarter earnings season, the positive sentiment is slowly but surely priced in.”

About 70 percent of S&P 500 companies that reported earnings for the latest quarter beat analysts’ profit estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

The S&P 500 has gained 1.1 percent this year, reaching a record close on March 7, after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the U.S. economy was strong enough to withstand measured reductions to the central bank’s monthly bond purchases. Three rounds of Fed stimulus have helped push the S&P 500 up 176 percent from a 12-year low, as U.S. equities begin the sixth year of a bull market that started March 9, 2009.

Fed Stimulus

The Federal Open Market Committee, which meets March 18-19, has cut monthly bond buying to $65 billion from $85 billion in December. Policy makers have indicated they plan to taper by $10 billion at each meeting absent a weakening in the economy.

The Fed is trying to determine how much of recent economic cooling has been due to weather. The government’s monthly jobs report last week showed U.S. employers added more workers than estimated in February.

More than three-quarters of Americans say the bull market has had little or no effect on their financial well-being, according to a Bloomberg National Poll. Seventy-seven percent of respondents dismissed the S&P 500’s gains since the financial crisis, according to the poll, taken March 7-10. Barely one in five — 21 percent — said the market’s gains have made them “feel more financially” secure.

ETF Investments

Investors have added $12.8 billion to U.S. equity exchange-traded funds in the past five days and withdrawn $2.4 billion from bond ETFs, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Real-estate stocks absorbed the most money among industry ETFs, taking in $156 million during the past week.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a gauge for U.S. stock volatility, fell 2.2 percent to 14.47 today. The measure has advanced 5.5 percent this year.

Six of 10 main industries in the S&P 500 declined today. Industrial shares and phone companies lost 0.2 percent. Utilities rose 1.3 percent.

Newmont Mining increased 2.7 percent to $25.01 and Barrick Gold rose 2.6 percent to $20.34. Gold rallied 1.8 percent, advancing to the highest level in almost six months as tension in Ukraine spurred demand for a haven.

EPL Deal

EPL Oil & Gas climbed 29 percent, its biggest gain on record, to $37.50. Energy XXI agreed to buy the company to become the largest public independent producer on the Gulf of Mexico shelf.

Energy XXI fell 7.8 percent to $21.54. The company has sought to grow through acquisitions and the use of horizontal drilling to help boost oil recovery. The combined entity, termed independent because it won’t have refineries, will pump 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, of which 70 percent will be crude.

Oxigene Inc. jumped 77 percent to $4.29 for its biggest gain since 2003. The pharmaceutical company said a second-phase trial showed its Zybrestat drug helped fight ovarian cancer.

PulteGroup dropped 1.3 percent to $19.67 and Toll Brothers fell 0.6 percent to $37.77. Credit Suisse analyst Dan Oppenheim cut both stocks’ ratings to neutral from outperform, citing continued weakness in demand and lower buyer traffic.

FTC Investigation

Herbalife tumbled 7.4 percent to $60.57. The nutrition company that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has accused of being a pyramid scheme said it is confident it is in compliance with all laws and will cooperate with the FTC investigation.

Urban Outfitters Inc. fell for a third day, declining 1.7 percent to $35.29, as Barclays downgraded the company to equal-weight from overweight. The Philadelphia-based teen- clothing retailer said yesterday it expects poor weather to contribute to lower sales and profit margins in the first quarter for its Urban Outfitters-branded shops.

Express Inc. slumped 12 percent to $16.05. The retailer forecast earnings will be between 12 cents a share and 18 cents in the first quarter, missing the average analyst projection for 41 cents. The company reported fourth-quarter profit of 57 cents a share, trailing the 59-cent estimate.

Progressive Corp. dropped 3.8 percent to $23.58 for the biggest loss in the S&P 500. The insurer’s operating earnings of 7 cents a share for February was less than an estimate of 13 cents from Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. analyst Meyer Shields.

Shields cited weak underwriting results in personal lines for Progressive’s earnings miss in a note today and lowered his full-year earnings forecast.

Posted: 17-Mar-2014 [Source: Vodafone]

[Vodafone has agreed to acquire Ono for €7.2 billion. Ono is currently serving 1.9 million customers in Spain.]

Vodafone Holdings Europe S.L.U. (“Vodafone”) announces today that it has agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Grupo Corporativo Ono, S.A. (“Ono” or the “Company”) for a total consideration equivalent to €7.2 billion on a debt and cash free basis (the “Transaction”). Ono has the largest next-generation network (“NGN”) in Spain, with approximately 7.2 million homes released to marketing in 13 of Spain’s 17 regions*, reaching more than 300 municipalities, including the nine largest cities. Ono offers fixed and mobile communications and television services to approximately 1.9 million customers. Principal benefits Highly attractive standalone business Ono is the leading NGN operator in Spain with 7.2 million homes released to marketing (equivalent to 41% of total homes in Spain), providing its customers with broadband speeds in excess of 200 Mbps and the country’s most innovative pay-TV service through TiVo. Ono has invested approximately €7 billion in its network since 1998. This has been built to a high standard with a consistent design across the entire footprint to deliver high speed broadband and telephony services. The network has a future-proof fibre architecture with 500 homes per node and abundant spare capacity within its 862 MHz spectrum. It has been fully upgraded to DOCSIS 3.0, and further upgrades to network speeds and capacities can be achieved at relatively limited cost as Ono owns circa 96% of ducts in its access network. Significant acceleration of Vodafone’s unified communications strategy in a key European market The Transaction enables Vodafone to take advantage of the rapid increase in the adoption of unified communications products and services in the Spanish market and provides Vodafone with immediate access to 7.2 million homes at a significant time-to-market advantage. Ono’s network is complementary to Vodafone’s fibre-to- the-home (“FTTH”) build programme** which will be refocused towards areas where Ono has limited or no network presence. Vodafone intends to complete its FTTH rollout to 1.5 million homes passed, providing it with access to a NGN network covering up to 10 million homes released to marketing, equivalent to 57% of total Spanish homes. In-market consolidation with substantial cost and capex savings The Transaction is expected to generate significant cost and capex savings with an annual run-rate of approximately €240 million (£200 million), before integration costs, in the fourth full year post completion, equivalent to a net present value of €2.0 billion (£1.7 billion) after integration costs. The savings will be primarily derived from utilising Ono’s network for mobile backhaul, limiting Vodafone’s FTTH build plan to the initial 1.5 million homes passed, the rationalisation of overlapping activities and the migration of Ono’s mobile traffic to Vodafone’s network. Significant potential to accelerate growth in Spain Vodafone will be able to leverage its extensive distribution network to increase the penetration of Ono’s homes released to marketing, which is currently lower than any other major European cable operator. There is also a significant opportunity to cross-sell Ono’s high quality broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV offerings to Vodafone’s existing customers. Vodafone also expects to be able to cross-sell its mobile services to Ono’s customers and offer new services, using both companies’ product sets and networks. Vodafone estimates revenue synergies with a total net present value of approximately €1.0 billion (£0.8 billion) after integration costs. Significantly value-accretive transaction The Transaction values Ono at a multiple of 7.5x 2013 EBITDA and 10.4x 2013 OpFCF adjusted for cost and capex synergies***. The Transaction comfortably meets Vodafone's M&A criteria and is expected to be accretive to Vodafone’s adjusted EPS**** and FCF per share after cost and capex and before integration costs from the first full year post completion. Ono management and employees Vodafone values the expertise of Ono’s management team and employees and will work closely with them to support the integration with Vodafone. As in similar recent transactions, Vodafone would expect Ono's management to become an integral part of the local management team, focused on the broadband, fixed telephony and pay-TV segments of the combined business. Ono’s employees will also benefit from a broader range of international career opportunities available across the Vodafone Group.

##2630|BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman, who is betting $1.16 billion that Herbalife is a fraud, spent $264,000 last year on lobbyists to press his case against the company, according to government documents filed in recent weeks.

That amount is dwarfed by the nearly $2 million Herbalife spent in 2013 on federal lobbying as the nutrition and weight loss company fought the billionaire investor's claims it runs a pyramid scheme. In an illegal pyramid scheme members earn more for recruiting new members into the scheme than for selling the products outside the network.

Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hired three lobbyists in 2013, marking the first time ever that the New York-based hedge fund has spent money on Washington lobbyists, data from the United States Senate Disclosure Act Database show.

In October Ibarra Strategy Group began working for Pershing Square and earned $30,000 for the year, the filingshows.

The group, founded by Mickey Ibarra, a former Director of Intergovernmental Affairs under President Bill Clinton, specializes in Latino outreach.

Ackman has accused Herbalife of unfairly targeting minorities. Civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens, which has asked California's Attorney General to probe Herbalife, echoed the fund manager's accusations. Herbalife said last month that it does not target members of minorities or low income communities.

The battle for the future of Herbalife is heating up this year with each side trying to press its case with Washington lawmakers as well as regulators, who may ultimately control the company's fate.

In the last days, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission refused to tell U.S. Senator Edward Markey, who asked them to probe the company, what they were doing on Herbalife. But each offered plenty of examples of having shut down illegal businesses before.

SEC chair Mary Jo White, who last year touted the benefits of shareholder activism, said the SEC's Enforcement Division has previously probed whether statements made about a business are "materially false or misleading, including statements regarding the compensation levels."

Ackman has said that 88 percent of Herbalife distributors earn nothing. That stands in stark contrast to some Herbalife distributors' testimonials where they tout lavish lifestyles as an incentive for others to sign up. Herbalife has said distributors results' depend on time, energy and dedication.

Ackman has forecast that Herbalife's share price will plummet to zero amid regulators' scrutiny but so far the fund manager is in the red on the bet, as Herbalife shares have climbed 61 percent in the last year. Since January, the shares have lost ground however, falling 17 percent.

Pershing Square also paid $84,000 to Moffett Group, run by former U.S. Representative Toby Moffett, who promises to bring clients' messages to the highest levels in Washington.

The bulk of its lobbying budget, $150,000, went to Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates, which describes itself as a full service government affairs firm.

During the same year, Herbalife spent at total $1.89 million on lobbying, according to public data from the Center for Responsive Politics.

Herbalife paid $250,000 to government relations firm Downey McGrath, which counted Boeing, Microsoft and Time Warner among its past clients.

IBC earned $30,000 from Herbalife last year while $140,000 went to Ogilvy, $160,000 was paid to Podesta Group and $40,000 went to Glover Park Group.

Herbalife also spent $1.27 million on lobbying on its own behalf.

Separately the company made a $10,000 donation last year to Democratic Attorneys General Association, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Pershing Square did not donate to this group. California's Attorney General, Kamala Harris, the person the Latin civil rights group LULAC last year asked to probe Herbalife is a Democrat.

The Associated Press





LONDON -- The Bank of England has appointed an International Monetary Fund official to a new job overseeing markets and banking -- a position created amid allegations that bank officials condoned fixing in currency markets.

Nemat "Minouche" Shafik, the IMF's deputy managing director, will be one of two deputy governors and join the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. Her appointment Tuesday helps correct a gender gap at the bank. When she takes up her post at the start of August, she will be the only woman on the nine-member MPC.

While at the IMF, Shafik oversaw much of its work in Europe during the past few crisis-fueled years.

Bank Gov. Mark Carney has pledged a "root and branch" review into how the bank monitors markets following the fixing allegations.##2633|Empty##2634|NEW YORK � Sbarro has filed for Chapter 11 reorganization for the second time in three years.

The bankruptcy filing by the struggling pizza chain Monday comes after the company shuttered 155 of its U.S. locations last month. Sbarro had cited declining traffic in the mall food courts where it does much of its business for the closings.

The company did not immediately provide details on whether any marketing or in-store changes were planned to help update its image and boost sales.

It says it still has more than 800 locations worldwide.

Sbarro also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain's image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn't take hold.

Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., says its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent. It said its filing is designed to ''allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy'' as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.##2635|Empty##2636|Fashion jobs, the latest fashion news and apparel business network for the UK fashion industry including Fashion jobs Career Centre##2637|Empty##2638|Empty##2639|Chinese company Alibaba confirms preparations for US listing

Updated

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has confirmed it plans to list in the United States after ruling out Hong Kong and London.

"Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States," the company said in a statement.

"This will make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals."

Analysts say the listing is expected to raise about $US10 billion, which would make it the technology industry's largest initial public offering (IPO) since Facebook's in 2012.

Alibaba is the world's largest online retailer and had been in negotiations with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

But talks broke down last year, in part because the city's listing rules prevented Alibaba founder Jack Ma and senior management retaining some control over the board of directors.

Alibaba wanted an alternative class share structure to give selected minority shareholders extra control over the board, but the Hong Kong bourse refused to change its rules.

"We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to, and support the process of innovation and development of, Hong Kong," Alibaba's statement said.

"Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China."

Reports say Alibaba could launch its IPO as soon as April, which could allow trading to begin by the third quarter.

Alibaba operates China's most popular e-shopping platform, Taobao, which has more than 90 per cent of the online market for consumer-to-consumer transactions.

Taobao has more than 800 million product listings and over 500 million users.

But data shows Alibaba's dominance of online retail in China is facing its biggest-ever challenge.

Market researcher Euromonitor says Alibaba lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew.

China's biggest social media company, Tencent, is leading the revolt.

It's linked the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.

Euromonitor says an array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead.

The research firm estimates China's internet retail market will triple its 2012 value by 2018 to more than $300 billion.

First posted##2640|##2641|Empty##2642|The Obama administration announced Monday that 5 million people had signed up for health plans through federal and stage exchanges, just two weeks before the deadline for consumers to obtain insurance or pay a fine.

In a blog post, Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, pointed to a “weekend wave of consumers signing up for new coverage and bringing enrollment nationwide to more than 5 million."

However, the administration originally projected that 7 million people would sign up for Obamacare by the end of March, a goal that is now very much in doubt. And the administration's revised target of 6 million enrollees, adjusted in the wake of the botched rollout of healthcare.gov, is no guarantee either.

“With only two weeks to go, we’re continuing to work hard to ensure that every American who wants to enroll in affordable coverage by the deadline of March 31st is able to do so,” Tavenner said. “So don’t delay; tell your friends and family to sign up today.”

The White House has ramped up its outreach to younger Americans in particular. For Obamacare to succeed, younger, healthier people need to sign up to help keep premiums down for older, sicker patients.

Just a quarter of those who have signed up so far are from the youngest demographic. Originally, the White House aimed for 38 percent of all sign-ups to be between the ages of 18 and 35.

President Obama has made direct appeals to younger people of late, including appearances on comedy shows and programs aimed at sports fans.

The administration still has not announced what percentage of sign-ups have actually paid their first month’s premium and the ratio of those who were previously uninsured.

Republicans argue that many of those signing up for Obamacare are merely replacing their old coverage plans, often at the behest of the federal government.##2643|Has coffee giant Starbucks just invented the future?

What happens when a reverse mortgage borrower passes away? Kiplinger tackles the question in an article this week, underscoring the fact that the borrower’s heirs will never owe more than the home is worth.

The loan will have to repaid shortly after the borrower moves from the home or passes away, Kiplinger writes, but there are options for those heirs.

“If one spouse has died but the surviving spouse is listed as a borrower on the reverse mortgage, he or she can continue to live in the home, and the terms of the loan do not change,” the article writes. “At the death of the last borrower, though, adult children and other nonspouse heirs must pay off the loan. They can keep the property, sell the property or turn the keys over to the lender—and their decision is ‘usually driven by whether there’s equity left in the property,’” Joseph DeMarkey, a principal member of Reverse Mortgage Funding told the publication.

Kiplinger details the “non-recourse” feature of reverse mortgages, explaining that the lender cannot go after the heirs’ estate or assets if the loan balance exceeds the value of the home with the reverse mortgage.

It’s in the heir’s best interest to act quickly, Kiplinger writes, in explaining the time line for notifications from the loan servicer and repayment.

This website has previously criticized the excessively high marijuana taxes levied in Colorado and Washington State – the first two states to legalize pot.

“If individuals want to grow marijuana on their own private property – and smoke it in a manner that doesn’t infringe on others people’s liberties – then they should be able to do so free from any government taxation,” we wrote. “Meanwhile if they want to sell their pot to others, they shouldn’t be forced to pay anything beyond the regular state sales tax.”

“Decriminalizing pot is not enough … it needs to be taxed fairly, not taxed to death,” we concluded.

Of course that’s not happening in left-leaning Colorado – where an assortment of levies raked in $2 million in tax revenue from recreational marijuana sales in January, the first month pot was legal (for purchases up to an ounce).

Bizarrely, Colorado will spend much of its pot revenue on government programs aimed at … you guessed it … keeping young people away from pot.

Sheesh …

Are these elected officials high? Wait … don’t answer that.

Excessive tax rates – as well as government-mandated limitations on purchase size – do not represent the free market at work. And on top of that Colorado is plowing its resources into demand reduction? This system is rigged for pot legalization to fail … forcing consumers back into the black market economy (where government makes nothing).

We have never believed the prospect of government revenue was a good reason to legalize anything (drugs, gambling, prostitution … you name it). Government has more than enough money to perform its core functions.

These things should be legal because America is – or at least is supposed to be – a free market, where individuals are permitted to buy and sell what they wish (including themselves) up to the point such transactions compromise another’s liberty.##2647|Activist investor Bill Ackman continues to try to convince investors and regulators that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) is a pyramid scheme. In a few minutes, he will begin a new presentation which he claims proves that the company is operating outside the law in China. He reviewed documents which he said he received from a former employee of the company, and he will be going through those documents in a the live presentation.

We will be live blogging the entire thing right here, so check back for more updates. The presentation starts at 2 p.m. Eastern, so updates will be flowing quickly after that time.

As of right now, shares of Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) are down 2% ahead of the beginning of Ackman’s presentation.

All times given are in Eastern.

2:03 p.m. – Bill Ackman is addressing this week’s article about Herbalife Ltd (NYSE:HLF) in The New York Times. He’s providing a history lesson about the controversy regarding Herbalife so far. The news article had accused Ackman of trying to be manipulative on this topic.

2:06 p.m.

The Times focused on Sen. Markey’s letter, which included questions which are similar to the allegations made by Ackman’s firm. Ackman provided some details regarding his support of political campaigns. He has not contributed directly to Sen. Markey’s campaign. Although he has given to politicians on both sides of the aisle who he “believes are good for America.” He learned from The Times article that his sister gave $500 to Sen. Markey last year but he didn’t know that she gave to his campaigns.

2:09 p.m – Ackman is now addressing recent articles regarding the amount of money he and Herbalife Ltd (NYSE:HLF) have spent on lobbying. The Times article said his statements are “provably false,” but he said none of his firm’s statements about Herbalife have been proven false.

Now he is running through the claims he has made about the company over the last year. He mentions Herbalife and the Latino community and says distributors make claims about making a lot of money.

2:12 p.m. – Herbalife Ltd (NYSE:HLF) still hasn’t responded to any of the questions posed by Bill Ackman some time ago. He is now turning to their focus on Herbalife’s China operations.

2:14 p.m. – Ackman is now turning to some statistics about Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in China. Net sales there were 10% of worldwide, net sales grew 69%. Management said China is “the most regulated market in which they operate” and that they have a “different model there from the rest of the world.”

Management also said they wouldn’t disclose their compensation program “other than to say that we are abiding by all local regulations.” Ackman wants to know why this compensation plan is a secret and notes that the company has said that it is transparent, but it is secretive about its China operations.

2:16 p.m. – Ackman is running through Chinese laws regarding direct selling and pyramid schemes. They hired OTG Research to meet with Herbalife distributors in China and reviewed the company’s SEC filings and internal financial documents. He said this shows the compensation plan is essential the same as in other places of the world.

Their research tells them that Herbalife violates China’s dlaws. Pays multi-level royalties on unlimited downline levels, pays royalties and commissions over 30% of sales volume. Herbalife incentivizes distributors to recruit potentially infinite downline.

He says SEC filings misleading regarding China sales.

2:19 p.m. – Pershing Square handed it over to OTG Research Group, who explained what they did. They spoke with staff and distributors at stores and attended Herbalife seminars and met with distributors offsite outside of stores.

OTG found three categories in Herbalife’s marketing plan: preferred customer, representative, distributor. Preferred customer buy 100 RMB Herbalife data set, fill out paperwork. They can product from retail stores but stil must pay full retail prices when buying products. Must have Herbalife ID to buy from retail store. Only reason to enroll is to begin process of enrolling.

Business Representative must accumulate 100 volume points by ordering enough products or building downline of other participants who buy $200 worth of product. Selling to someone outside company doesn’t earn points. Business reps make money through retroactive credits, one for product personally buy. Other for product bought by someone you have recruited.

2:24 p.m. – Distributors consider the retroactive credits as revenue, credits are taxable and Herbalife withholds tax. Distributors receive credits from selling to people they have

Business representative entitled to 15 to 25%.

Up to distributor, must accumulate 5,000 volume points by buying product or recruiting others. Spending $3,200 a month to do this and you don’t make direct profit on what you buy.

2:27 p.m. – they showed a diagram drawn by an Herbalife distributor in China. There are five tiers of distributors. Lowest level comes out to $3,200 of product must be bought per month. Middle level, $20,000 a month must be bought three months in a row, by top level, $200,000 three months in a row.

Distributors earn 30% retroactive credits and also hourly consulting pay, made up of commission, management bonus and Mark Hughes dividend. Herbalife wants people to think distributors paid hourly because of this firm. It’s not based on hours. It’s 100% based on commissions from downlines and hitting sales targest.

Distributor status assigned an hourly consulting rate. It based the amount of royalties and recruiting awards and divides the amount by consulting rate to arrive at “fictional number of hours” they have worked.

2:30 p.m. – Distributors hourly consulting pay. Junior see 250 RMB per hour. Herbalife divides total hourly consulting pay by Distributors consulting rate. They found Chinese distributors say hourly consulting fees are “far more lucrative than selling products to retail customers.” Some say it’s not possible to make as much money selling products as through consulting fees.

One distributor told them importance of recruiting people by founding Herbalife clubs. Some might think they are doing pyramid sales, He told a story that when he was introduced to Herbalife he heard similar data, he also thought it was pyramid sales and decided not to do it. On the way home, he said he saw a huge Herbalife billboard, he knew then that it wasn’t pyramid sales because no company would advertise itself so widely if it was a pyramid.

2:35 p.m. – Distributors said Hourly Consulting Pay is passive income and depends on recruiting and unrelated to “any supposed consulting. Several distributors drew sketches to explain how they recruit. Many sketches look like pyramids. It’s hard to explain the compensation plan without drawing a pyramid.

2:37 p.m. – Meeting with one on one distributors only way to learn about compensation plan. They don’t want to talk about it. People aren’t limited to how many downlines they have. So some distributors drew suns with lines emanating 360 degrees from the center.

Now they’re turning to Chinese law.

2:39 p.m. – Legal experts say paying 100 RMB to buy preferred customer seems to violate direct sales and pyramid sales regulations. Participants ordering products to accumulate points also seems to violate these regulations. Recruiting others to order products and advance seem to violate regulation that only company and branches can recruit sales promoters. Herbalife distributors in China are doing recruiting for own benefit. Earning commissions on those recruits and their purchases seems to violate pyramid regulations and criminal law. This defines a puramid scheme as a scheme in which the calculation of remunierations or kickbacks to participantes directly or indirectly dependent on the number of personas recreuidted and the participantes are induced to continue or coerced into continuing recruiting others to participate.

2:42 p.m. – Now they are looking at Herbalife’s SEC filings. Company sets China apart. In China, “sales employees and service fees” included in SG&A expenses. China’s contribution margin looks more than double the rest of the world. But when adjusting for the expense called compensation to China sales employees, pro forma contribution margin mirrors those of rest of the world. So instead Herbalife says China model is different than rest of the world, but it doesn’t look like it is in the SEC filings.

2:46 p.m. – They looked at internal Herbalife documents which show how it calculates hourly consulting pay. This document from 2010 shows 25% rebate, R/O for royalty overrides of 15%, P/B for production bonuses of 7%, MH Bonus of 1% and 1% China bonus.

They found more detailed buildup of China numbers, found a “hidden row” which shows China Royalties in 2009, shows same $79.1 million number, referred to it as China Royalties instead.

2:51 p.m. – Calculating hourly consulting pay, they use same percentages as they do in rest of the world, plus a 1% China bonus, which experts think emphasizes greater emphasis on China recruiting. Pershing’s experts believe these documents show it doesn’t base royalty compensation on hourly consulting fees but on retail sales percentages just like on royalty overrides in rest of the world.

Ackman thinks Herbalife hiding the fact that China royalty expense is same as in rest of the world and that investors would have more accurate picture of what it’s doing in China, but he thinks if did it right, then it would be showing that it is in violation of China law.

2:57 p.m. – They’re summing up everything they already said. Basically, they’re saying that Herbalife is doing same model in China as in rest of world and the model violates China laws about pyramid schemes and even a criminal law. And they say the company’s SEC filings mislead investors regarding its China operations.

Ackman’s experts believe Herbalife is indeed violating Chinese law.##2648|Although there still remains room for improvement, the trends for housing and the economy – and Americans' outlook – have remained positive overall, according to the results of both Fannie Mae's National Housing Survey and the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard for February.

Notably, Fannie Mae reports that respondents' home price expectations climbed significantly in February – with 50% saying home prices will go up in the next year – following a measurable downturn in January, while the share of those who believe it is a good time to buy a home ticked up by three percentage points.

At the same time, Fannie says those who believe that it would be easy to get a mortgage dropped seven percentage points from January's all-time survey high of 52%. The share of respondents who say the economy is on the wrong track increased three percentage points to 57% in February, following a four-month decline. Despite a decrease in optimism across some of the indicators the month before, consumer attitudes remain in generally positive ranges, Fannie notes.

‘Similar to the noisy economic and housing data published over the past few months, we've seen a corresponding increase in volatility in our survey results, particularly for home price expectations and perceptions about the ease of getting a mortgage,’ comments Doug Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist at Fannie Mae.

Duncan believes that the recent unusual weather patterns might have played a role in the 6% jump in the number of consumers who said their household expenses have increased significantly from a year ago (e.g., heating costs). "Despite the volatile month-to-month changes, we believe that the housing recovery is continuing but is not yet robust," he says.

Additionally, Fannie Mae's share of respondents who say the economy is on the right track decreased four percentage points from the month before to 35%.

To offer another view into the housing market for February, the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard shows progress among key indicators, including rising purchases of new homes, decreasing foreclosures and stabilizing house prices.

Kurt Usowski, deputy assistant secretary for economic affairs for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, says while there is "encouraging news" for housing, it "does not detract from the need to build on this progress, as too many homeowners remain underwater and mortgage delinquency rates remain elevated."

Part of the "encouraging news" is that homeowners' equity continues to rise. According to the Federal Reserve, homeowners' equity was up nearly $412 billion, or 4.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2013, reaching $10.026 trillion – the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2007. Homeowners' equity has risen sharply since the beginning of 2012, with equity up 60%, or more than $3.7 trillion, during this period.

New home purchases have also increased. After declining for the last two months, purchases of new homes rose 9.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000 in January – the highest unit-pace since mid-2008.

Tim Bowler, Treasury's acting assistant secretary, remarks, "While the housing market as a whole has made significant progress, servicers still have room for improvement, and Treasury will continue to press the industry to improve servicer performance."

While there are positive trends in the housing market, the scorecard notes that officials caution the economy is still healing from the Great Recession.

“Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke,” Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a news briefing.

The last message from the cockpit – “All right, good night” – came around the time that two of the missing plane’s crucial signalling systems were switched off.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid have become a primary focus of the investigation into the fate of Flight 370, with one of the key questions being who was controlling the aircraft when the communications systems were disabled.

The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot’s seemingly nonchalant final words.

ACARS transmits key information on a plane’s condition to the ground.

The plane’s transponder – which relays radar information on the plane’s location – was switched off just two minutes after the voice message.

The revelation came as Malaysian authorities announced that 26 countries were now involved in the search for MH370, which disappeared 10 days ago.

Malaysia’s transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein had earlier confirmed that the apparently relaxed final voice communication from the jet came after the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was deliberately shut down. ACARS transmits to the ground key information on a plane’s condition.

He said every crew member on board and all ground crew working with the plane were being investigated.

In addition both pilots' families had been interviewed.

Watch: MH370 Captain and co-pilot last time on camera

Fourteen minutes later, the plane's transponder, which relays radar information on the plane's location, was also switched off.

Shortly afterwards the plane disappeared from civilian radar, but Malaysia has since confirmed that the air force tracked it for hours on military radar -- without taking action.

The plane went missing early in the morning of March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard, spawning a massive international search across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean that has turned up no trace of wreckage.

On Monday, Australia said it had shifted its focus to the central eastern Indian Ocean upon request by Malaysian authorities.

“We will do what we can in the future to assist Malaysia to locate the aircraft in whatever state it is in,” Australian Defence Minister David Johnston told China's Xinhua News Agency.

Two Australian P-3C Orion aircraft have participated in the search since March 9, said Johnston. One aircraft is searching in the Indian Ocean to the north and west of the Cocos Islands, and the other one will continue its operation west of Malaysia, he said.

The vast search area was focusing on two corridors: one stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and the other from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.

USS Kidd, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, is stepping up search efforts in the Indian Ocean, said a statement issued by the US 7th Fleet. Extra lookouts have been posted, and the two MH-60R helicopters on board the warship are flying additional sorties each day.

Countries assisting in the search range from the former Soviet central Asian republics in the north to Australia in the south, along with France, which administers a scattering of islands.

Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Malaysia had requested further satellite data from the United States, China, France and other countries.

"We are asking countries that have satellite assets ... to provide further satellite data. And we are contacting additional countries who may be able to contribute specific assets relevant to the search and rescue operation," he said.

After suspending its search operations in the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal on Sunday, India said that it may provide further assistance. A statement from India’s Defense Ministry said “a strategy for further searches is being formulated”.

The revelation of the last message suggests that the person who delivered the message was aware that Acars had been manually shut down.

Experts said it would have taken specialist knowledge to disable the communications system, intensifying scrutiny of captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid.

Watch: Hunting MH370: A needle in a growing haystack

Police searched the homes of the pilots on Saturday and dismantled and reassembled a flight simulator belonging to the captain, the country's police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said.

Khalid stressed the probe was covering "all" the 239 passengers and crew, as well as engineers who may have had contact with the aircraft before take-off.

With no clear motive established as to why someone diverted the plane, all possibilities - hijack, sabotage or personal or psychological problems of someone on board - were being investigated.

Hishammuddin said authorities had not received any ransom or other demand.

Background checks of passengers on the flight have not found anything suspicious, but not every country whose nationals were on board has responded to requests for information, Khalid said.

Additional reporting by Agence France-Presse##2650|WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Consumer prices in the U.S. rose slightly in February because of higher food and housing costs, but overall inflation remained quiet, according to the latest government figures.

The consumer price index increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, the Labor Department said. That matched forecast of economists polled by MarketWatch.

“Inflation was conspicuous by its near absence again in February,’ said economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC World Markets.

Bloomberg Vegetables are displayed for sale in the produce aisle at a Publix Super Markets Inc. grocery store in Knoxville, Tennessee.

The price of food jumped 0.4% — the largest gain since September 2011 — because of higher costs of meat, poultry, fish, dairy and vegetables.

Yet while food prices have only risen 1.4% over the past year, they are likely to increase in the coming months because of drought in California and unusually cold weather in other parts of the country. By some estimates, food prices at grocery stores could rise 3% or more in 2014 and give a sharp pinch to consumers.

Higher food prices, however, were largely offset by a 0.5% reduction in the cost of energy. Lower gasoline costs more than negated increases in fuel oil and natural gas. High demand for home heating fuels boosted prices during a very cold month.

Excluding food and energy, so-called core consumer prices also rose 0.1% in February. Housing costs, the biggest expense for most consumers, advanced 0.2%. Prices also rose for medical care and airline tickets.

The core rate is viewed by the Federal Reserve as a more useful gauge of underlying inflationary trends. Over the past 12 months, the core rate of inflation has risen 1.6%, well below the Fed’s limit for inflation.

Overall consumer prices have climbed a much smaller 1.1% in the past 12 months.

The average hourly pay of U.S. workers, meanwhile, jumped 0.3% in February to mark the biggest increase since last April, adjusted for inflation.

Real wages have risen 1.1% over the past 12 months, up sharply from 0.4% in January.

U.S. housing starts fall slightly in February##2651|Empty##2652|Speaking at an investor conference, the Time Warner CEO said "the quality and diversity of programming" on TV is the best it's ever been.

Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes says his priorities for the media conglomerate are increasing its commitment to high-quality content, improving technology and strengthening its international business.

Speaking at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet and Telecom Conference in Palm Beach, Fla., Bewkes noted that "Time Warner is a very different company than it was five years ago. At that time it was pretty widely diversified. Now we're a fairly concentrated video content company."

He added, "We’re basically feeling very alive very excited and very focused on what we think is the television revolution."

Leading the way for Time Warner, said Bewkes, is HBO. When asked what television would look like in five years, he commented that "you're about to see the full fruition of what got started at HBO 15 years ago." By that he meant the proliferation of video on demand.

He was bullish on the state of the television industry as a whole, adding that "the quality and diversity of programming is greater than it’s ever been. So what that means for us is it means consumers are going to be evermore engaged with their favorite television program."

Bewkes took time to praise several of the Turner networks. He noted that TBS was the No. 1 network in the 18-34 and 18-54 demographics in primetime. Adult Swim, meanwhile, ranks No. 2 in the 18-34 demo.

"That's a very strong creative platform for us to attract talent and incubate new ideas," he said of the network, which shares a channel with Cartoon Network.

Bewkes also addressed the proposed Time Warner Cable and Comcast deal. He said there's some concern about competition but noted that it will likely work itself out. He also joked, "It would be good if the Time Warner Cable trucks didn't say Time Warner because people are calling me."

When asked about the importance of Turner's NBA deal, which is set to expire in two years, Bewkes allayed concerns that the company would lose the partnership.

"This is very important and good programming we think our performance with NBA has been terrific," he said. "We think it’s important and we feel we have the resources to continue with that and we think we’ll have it. We still have it for a couple more years... We’re very interested in it."

Twitter: @NatJarv##2653|A stealth mission by operatives supported by the guided-missile destroyer USS Roosevelt saw the North Korea-flagged vessel Morning Glory captured off Cyprus late on Sunday.

A team from another US destroyer, USS Stout, is to escort the tanker – said to be laden with 200,000 barrels of oil - back to Libya.

In a statement from the US Department of State, Pentagon press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said nobody was hurt in the mission that was requested by both the governments of Libya and Cyprus.

"The boarding operation, approved by President Obama and conducted just after 10pm EDT on 16 March 16 in international waters south-east of Cypress [sic], was executed by a team of US Navy Seals attached to Special Operations Command Europe,” Kirby said.

"USS Roosevelt provided helicopter support and served as a command and control and support platform for the other members of the force assigned to conduct the mission.

"The Morning Glory will be under way soon to a port in Libya with a team of sailors from the USS Stout (DDG-55) embarked. The sailors will be supervising the transit.”

The Morning Glory is thought to be owned by Egyptian interests, but North Korean officials have denied any involvement in the tanker’s operations, saying they are only the flag state of the vessel.

Kirby referred to the ship as “a stateless vessel” and said it had been taken by just “three armed Libyans”. North Korea revoked the tanker's registration once the vessel evaded Libyan forces.

The Morning Glory docked at the port of Es Sider east of Tripoli more than a week ago. This prompted then prime minister Ali Zeidan to call for the crew’s arrest and lead some Libyan authorities to demand that it be bombed.

The General National Congress then issued a decree ordering the rapid assembly of a military taskforce to seize back control of all rebel-held ports.

Last Tuesday Zeidan said that the Morning Glory had been intercepted outside of Es Sider port and was under governmental control.

However, rebels also told the BBC that this claim was “government lies” and that the vessel remained docked at Es Sider, from where it later sailed.

Reports indicate that bad weather forced naval vessels to sail close to shore, leaving the route to international waters relatively free for the tanker, which escaped.

The fiasco cost Zeidan his job as he lost a vote of confidence in Parliament. Despite having a travel ban imposed on him, he swiftly fled to Malta from where he is said to have flown on to somewhere else in Europe.

The Morning Glory does not appear on numerous shipping databases, but one shows that it was named Gulf Glory and flew the Liberian flag up until at least October last year. It was then sold to unidentified interests, another database shows.##2654|Empty##2655|Empty##2656|Empty##2657|Sometimes when one company raises prices, we consumers benefit. Today's case example is Amazon's $20 increase for Amazon Prime membership (which you can still get around if you really want to). Shoprunner, noticing Prime members' distress at this price hike, is offering us unlimited 2-day shipping for free for a year.

The free 2-day shipping works at major online retailers such as Newegg, Radio Shack, Toys R Us, Timberland, and Tiger Direct--and even the delivery fee from Dominos. Like Prime for Amazon, there's no minimum order size. Even better, return shipping is free (unlike with Amazon Prime).

To get the free year, however, you'll have to provide proof of your current Prime membership (not yet renewed), and that involves jumping through a few hoops. In your Amazon account, take a screenshot of the printable receipt for your Prime membership andthen email it to DoneWithPrime@ShopRunner.com.

Even if you decide to stick with Prime, you can still get the free year of ShopRunner, which is normally worth $79. (After your free one year trial, your membership will expire and your credit card won't be charged unless you authorize it.)

(Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time since the suburbs began booming.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise — the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

“People are making a fundamental shift to having options” aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the public transportation association. “This is a long-term trend. This isn’t just a blip.”

Expanding bus and train networks help spur the growth.

Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased 6 percent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines. Overall, LA Metro gained 9 million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transportation association said. Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.

Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large ridership gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area’s behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation’s urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.

“People want to work and live along transit lines,” Melaniphy said. “Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.”

In a complaint filed Friday with the United States District Court for the Central District of California, city attorney Mike Feuer charged Time Warner Cable with bilking the municipality to the tune of $9.7 million, a sum that includes $7.19 million in unpaid 2010 and 2011 franchise fees and another $2.51 million in delinquent payments from the previous two years.

“Time Warner Cable has derived billions of dollars from its cable television franchise in the city of Los Angeles, yet stubbornly continues to flout its statutory obligations to compensate the city … fully for this privilege,” the complaint reads, before going on to note that the cable operator generates “more than $1 billion in revenue every two years from the residents of Los Angeles, a sum dwarfing the fees it is required to pay the city in return.”

The city’s attorneys said that the unpaid franchise fees and Public, Educational, Government use fees represent millions that could be put to use to pay firefighter and police officer salaries and maintain parks and libraries.

While the charges in the suit are characteristically byzantine, the city’s central argument would appear to boil down to the “precipitous and wrongful withholding” of contractually owed monies. Feuer’s office seems particularly enraged by the fact that the operator underpaid by as much as $5.22 million at the end of the city’s 2010-11 financial year, which only served to “exacerbate the City’s well-publicized fiscal crisis.”

The defendants cited in the 24-page complaint are Time Warner Cable, Inc., Time Warner Cable Pacific West, Time Warner Cable Enterprises and the Time Warner Entertainment Advance/Newhouse Partnership.

The operator responded to the lawsuit with the following statement: “As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider…Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen. We are disappointed the city has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit. It will now be resolved through the legal process.”

Per details of the complaint, Time Warner Cable pays a premium to operate within the confines of Los Angeles. The operator forked over $46.1 million in 2010 and 2011 franchise fees, or a little more than $23 million per annum.

The lawsuit arrives at a particularly inopportune moment for Time Warner Cable, which is preparing to be bought out by Comcast in a $45.2 billion deal. What was already certain to be a regulatory boondoggle may have become that much more of a target for crusading lawmakers.##2661|##2662|Empty##2663|Why did this happen?

It took nearly a decade for GM to issue a recall to fix it. In the meantime, at least 13 people died in 31 crashes that may have been related to the faulty switches. GM and federal safety regulators have known about many of those crashes for years.

Why it took so long to act on an urgent safety matter is now a key question GM must answer. On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Justice Dept. investigators are considering pressing criminal charges against the automaker. Meanwhile, Congress is planing public hearings and personal-injury lawyers are circling. GM began the recall in early February, then expanded it a couple of weeks later. The recall tally now includes about 1.4 million Chevy Cobalts and Pontiac G5s, plus a few lower-volume models. (Full details are here.) As the controversy has grown, GM's stock has gone the other direction, falling by about 4% so far in March and 15% for the year.

The basic problem is that a key in the ignition could inadvertently slip or get bumped into the accessory or off position — even while the car is moving — which can disable power brakes, steering and airbags. GM is advising owners of the vehicles to use the key alone, without a key chain or anything else that could add weight to the ignition switch, until replacement parts are shipped to dealers and owners are notified a fix is ready.

The potential death toll makes the GM recall the most significant since Toyota recalled more than 6 million vehicles in 2009 and 2010, in a safety controversy linked to more than 80 deaths. That fiasco could ultimately cost Toyota more than $2 billion in fines, lost sales and litigation. But GM seems to have learned from Toyota’s troubles, and may not face nearly the damage to its sales or brand image that Toyota did. Here are 4 reasons why:

The problem happened at the “old GM.” All recalled models were manufactured before GM declared bankruptcy and received a federal bailout in 2009. GM no longer makes any of the vehicles. And since the recalled vehicles were built, GM has undergone a vast transformation under four CEOs, including the current chief, Mary Barra. “I don’t think this is going to get as big as the Toyota issue,” says Karl Brauer of car-research site KBB.com. “These are old models that GM never hung its hat on. It was a long time ago.”

So far, consumers seem to agree. GM’s “buzz score,” as measured by research firm YouGov Brand Index, has ticked down a little bit recently, but so have the scores for Ford (F) and Chrysler, as this chart shows:

That buzz could weaken further, however, since a drumbeat of negative news is like as Congress holds hearings, victims' stories make the news and a criminal probe deepens. Congressional investigators will also probe why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which enforces safety rules, never forced a recall even though it was aware of the problem.

GM is conducting the recall voluntarily. Toyota erred grievously in 2009 by aggressively resisting a recall and dismissing the complaints of customers, insisting there was nothing wrong with its vehicles until basically forced by Washington to conduct a massive recall. GM, by contrast, is admitting there’s a problem and seemingly cooperating with investigators. What’s still unclear, however, is whether GM stiff-armed the NHTSA and managed to prevent a recall in the years leading up to its bankruptcy, when the company was bleeding money.

Story Continues##2665|Libya's interim national assembly has approved a vote of no-confidence in Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, naming the current defense minister to replace him on an interim basis.



The move by the assembly to name Abdallah al-Thani came after 124 votes to dismiss the prime minister, four more than the majority needed for the motion to carry.



Libyan TV reported earlier that protesters demonstrating in front of the assembly's temporary headquarters at the Radisson Hotel tried to storm the meeting, but failed. The political drama followed news a North Korean-flagged oil tanker may have escaped a government naval blockade.



A Libyan militia controling the eastern port of Sidra defied government authority to load the tanker with oil. Various sources in Libya said the vessel had evaded government naval vessels and sailed to sea.



Libyan Coast Guard Colonel Reda Issa said the tanker had been “targeted” by Libyan vessels “55 miles off the coastal port of Sidra” and that it had been “disabled.”



Sky News Arabia reported that Libyan coast guard vessels had shelled the tanker, creating a small fire on board and forcing it to halt.



Zeidan complained earlier that Islamist militiamen in an eastern region were creating instability across large swathes of the country, fighting other militias, killing civilians and issuing edicts against members of the government.



Several Libyan analysts said Islamist members of the national assembly were behind the move to dismiss Zeidan, who had clashed with the Islamists on a number of occasions.



The Islamist militia commander behind the recent tug-of-war with the government over the export of oil by the so-called “regional government of Barqa,” issued a statement calling for the United States to “allow regions to export oil independently, but oversee the financial transactions.”

The U.S. has condemned the sale of oil by any organization other than Libya's central government, calling attempted sales by the Barqa region “piracy.”##2666|Empty##2667|This editorial appeared first in the New York Times:

China is causing new anxieties in Asia with a defence budget for 2014 that totals $132 billion US, up 12.2 per cent over the previous year.

These numbers should not be used as an excuse to ratchet up U.S. military spending. But they do raise legitimate concerns about China's motives that Beijing should seek to dispel, especially at a time when regional tensions are rising.

Although China's overall economic growth rate has declined, the new defence budget reflects the biggest increase in three years and continues a several-decades-long trend of double-digit increases.

Many experts assume that the real total is higher. Even so, the budget is far below that of the United States, which was $526.8 billion for fiscal 2014 and finances the world's largest, most expensive and advanced military program. It is reasonable to expect that as the world's second-largest economy, China, over time, would invest more on defence to protect its security and economic interests.

But the budget increases are not taking place in a vacuum. With its aggressive new approach to the region, China has sowed suspicion among its neighbours, who fear not only economic but military dominance.

China is engaged in a dangerous dispute with Japan over the sovereignty of islands administered by Japan in the East China Sea, raising fears that frequent movements around the islands by Chinese military patrols and Japanese fishing vessels could spark a conflict. Last November, China stunned Japan, South Korea and the United States by declaring a new air defence zone over parts of that sea.

China has also been intimidating Southeast Asian nations that oppose its territorial claims in the South China Sea, with its fisheries and reputed oil and gas reserves.

While some experts predict that it could be decades before the Chinese military catches up with the United States, China is investing in new systems, including submarines, surface ships and anti-ship ballistic missiles, that could be used to further intimidate neighbours or deny the United States access to Asian waters to defend its allies.

China says the world has nothing to fear, but it could mitigate concerns by explaining why it needs such hefty increases and where the money will be spent, as the United States does. More consultation between the Chinese and U.S. militaries would also be useful. So would a serious effort to resolve the territorial disputes, or at least agree on a code of conduct for managing them.##2668|Empty##2669|McDonald’s performance disappointed in February as the fast food giant weathered harsh competition and cold winter temperatures for lower-than-expected sales, particularly in the United States.

People have been wigging out in the media and on Facebook about the upcoming increase for Amazon Prime from $79 to $99 per year. Personally, I think the revised price is still a great deal.

I joined Amazon Prime back on September 04, 2007. At the time, the price was $79 a year and the benefit was free two-day shipping on many products.

The shipping was worth it to me, since I regularly gift a lot of books to people, and not having to pay shipping makes a substantial difference.

And then they added on the perks of free movies and TV episodes, as well as borrowing books.

Currently, you can stream of 40,000 movies & TV episodes, and there are ovver 500,000 Kindle titles to borrow for free. Just today, I watched one of my favorites, Glengarry Glen Ross, on there, and I’m checking out the 30,000+ business titles that are freely available.

Realistically, I would have paid 2x or 3x the price for what I get, so a $20 increase kicking in later this year (the first increase in the 7 years I’ve been using it) isn’t so bad.

If you are not currently subscribed to Amazon Prime, you can still pay the $79 rate for the first year, and they have a 30 day free trial.

Libyan gunboats later chased the tanker along Libya’s eastern Mediterranean coast and opened fire, damaging it, a military spokesman said. Italian naval ships were helping move the tanker to a Libyan government-controlled port, he said. But Italy denied any of its vessels were in the area at the time and the reported firing incident could not be confirmed.

Western powers fear the vast North African state could even break apart with the government struggling to rein in armed militias and tribesmen who helped oust dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but want to grab power and oil revenues.

Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, will be temporarily replaced by Defence Minister Abdallah al-Thinni, who was sworn in by parliament on Tuesday evening.

Zeidan, who came to power in 2012 after Libya’s first free parliamentary vote following four decades of quirky one-man rule by Gaddafi, had been facing opposition from Islamists and the public blaming him for Libya’s anarchic transition since 2011.

Deputies said they had decided to mount a no-confidence vote after the tanker managed to sail away from Es Sider port, one of three major export terminals the government has lost to rebels.

“The government has been weakened for a time and we need a new personality,” said al-Sharif al-Wafi, an independent lawmaker. A new prime minister will be elected by deputies within two weeks, he said.

State prosecutor Abdel-Qader Radwan said later he had banned Zeidan from travelling abroad because he faced an investigation over alleged financial irregularities.

Zeidan told Reuters late on Monday in an interview that navy forces had halted the tanker and were escorting it to a government-controlled port in western Libya.

But rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran mocked Zeidan by going on television hours later while standing on a ship, insisting his forces still controlled the 37,000-tonne tanker.

When Libyans woke up the next morning officials had to admit the North Korea-flagged tanker had escaped at dawn, making it the first sale of crude bypassing the Tripoli government.

Walid al-Tarhouni, spokesman for the national oil protection forces, said navy boats chased the tanker hours later east of Benghazi, further east, and opened fire.

“The ship was damaged and it is not moving,” he said. Italian ships were helping to shift the tanker to a government-run port, he said. But the Italian defense ministry denied any of its vessels had been in the area at the time.

It was not possible to verify the firing incident at sea. Government and rebels have given conflicting accounts of the tanker saga.

It was unclear where the tanker had planned to sail. Government officials say the ship was flagged in North Korea, a flag of convenience to keep the ownership secret.

TRANSITION GETS MORE COMPLICATED

Zeidan’s exit gave joy to his many opponents but it complicates Libya’s transition as there is no obvious successor who can unite the feuding parties in a country with no tradition of political institutions.

Parliament spokesman Omar Hmeidan speaks during a news conference in Tripoli March 11, 2014. REUTERS/Ismail Zitouny

Analysts said Zeidan was not to blame for many problems such as lack of development since the ousting of Gaddafi as the government was simply running out of money due to a wave of protests at oilfields and ports. Oil is Libya’s lifeline.

Zeidan had accused the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists of blocking budget payments for infrastructure projects and improved army and police forces to make him fail.

Parliament will support acting prime minister Thinni and not obstruct his work, its head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain told the assembly after the defense minister gave his oath.

But while he spoke, clashes erupted in the central city of Sirte west of Es Sider port where rebels were fighting pro-government forces assembled to end the blockages of oil ports.

Rebel gunmen had blocked the gate to an air base in Sirte, the only main air force base in the region. Residents said fighters on both sides had been wounded though no details were immediately available.

In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said.

Western diplomats worry the conflict over oil might dismember Libya as rebels demand autonomy for the east, which was neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte.

The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.

They want to restore political autonomy with the historic eastern Cyrenaica region which shared power and wealth with Tripolitania in the west under King Idris, who preceded Gaddafi.

Libya has been trying to rebuild its armed forces since Gaddafi’s overthrow, but analysts say they are not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising against the veteran strongman.##2673|Empty##2674|The jacket finally fits: Men's Wearhouse is buying rival Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

The agreement ends a months-long back and forth. The combined company will have more than 1,700 U.S. stores. And the Jos. A. Bank outlets will keep their name and possibly keep their "buy one suit and get three free" deals.

Men's Wearhouse Inc. announced Tuesday that it will pay $65 per share, a 5 percent premium to Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc.'s most recent closing price.

Jos. A. Bank got the ball rolling in October when it offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billion. Men's Wearhouse scoffed at that offer, and turned the tables, offering to buy its rival for $1.54 billion.

By early March, Men's Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 per share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 per share if some conditions were met.

Jos. A. Bank also said Tuesday that it was terminating its deal to acquire the parent company of Eddie Bauer, which sells rugged outerwear. That deal was announced on Feb. 14, but Jos. A. Bank left the door open. It said that if it received a superior acquisition offer, it would pay a termination fee to end the Eddie Bauer deal.

"Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos. A. Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach," Doug Ewert, president and CEO of Men's Wearhouse, said in a statement.

Both companies said that the deal would complement each other's business models, and better serve an expanded customer base in more locations and improve its sourcing and merchandising capabilities.

They expect a smooth integration with no rebranding or remodeling required. Jos. A. Bank's store banner will remain in place.

Jos. A. Bank, based in Hampstead, Md., sells men's tailored and casual clothing, sportswear and operates 623 stores in 44 states and the District of Columbia. While it gears to a more established male professional, it's known for generous promotions like buying one suit or sport coat and getting three for free.

Men's Wearhouse sells men's sportswear and suits through its namesake chain of stores, as well as the Moores and K&G retail chains. It runs more than 1,200 stores and is also in the tuxedo-rental business. Recently, it's been going after younger shoppers with suits with slimmer silhouettes. It's also trying to raise the average ticket price and announced in July that it's buying upscale Joseph Abboud brand for about $97.5 million in cash.

The transaction is expected to close by the third quarter.##2675|Nutrition supplements company Herbalife Ltd. (HLF), which has been accused of operating as a pyramid scheme, said Wednesday that it received a civil investigation demand from the Federal Trade Commission or FTC. Shares of Herbalife tumbled more than 7 percent in the regular trading session.

Herbalife said it welcomed the FTC probe due to the "tremendous amount of misinformation" in the marketplace and added that it will cooperate fully with the FTC. The company also said it does not plan to make any additional comments regarding the matter unless there are material developments.

A multilevel marketing firm, Herbalife sells nutritional supplements, energy, sports and fitness products. While its stock price has gained strength, the company has been dubiously portrayed by some critics as a pyramid scheme enterprise that will fail.

Its most acerbic critic has been William Ackman, the activist manager of hedge fund Pershing Square, who gas made a $1 billion bet that the company's stock price will fall. Meanwhile, key investor Carl Icahn believes that Herbalife has a legitimate model. On January 24, Herbalife stock tumbled after Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, called for a probe into the allegations.

Herbalife said Tuesday that it remained confident in its business in China and will continue to invest in the key market as well as collaborate with the Chinese government to deliver its nutrition supplements through lawful direct selling practices. The statement was in response to a presentation by Pershing Square, which said Herbal Life is operating in violation of Chinese law.

On Monday, Herbalife commented on a report dated March 10 in the New York Times with the headline "After Big Bet, Hedge Fund Pulls the Levers of Power" by Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson. The article detailed how Ackman employed a sophisticated and unprecedented campaign to exert pressure on lawmakers and regulators to investigate and destroy Herbalife, to protect the $1 billion bet he has made against the company.

In mid-February, Herbalife reported a profit for the fourth quarter that beat analysts' estimates, driven by robust growth in China, Americas and EMEA regions. The company's net income for the fourth quarter was $123.5 million or $1.15 per share, up from $112 million or $1.00 per share in the same period last year. Sales for the quarter jumped 20 percent to $1.27 billion from $1.06 billion in the prior year.

HLF closed Wednesday's regular trading session at $60.57, down $4.82 or 7.37 percent on a volume of 16.00 million shares. In after-hours, the stock further declined $0.45 or 0.74 percent to $60.12.

KEY DATA: JOLTS: Openings: +60,000; Year-over-Year: +281,000; Hires: -43,000; Year-over-Year: +146,000; Quits: -42,000; Year-over-Year: +74,000

IN A NUTSHELL: "Despite a sluggish month of economic numbers, job openings grew and that is another indication that the labor market is in decent shape."

WHAT IT MEANS: The Federal Reserve is meeting next week and the Job Openings and Separations report is supposed to be one of Chair Janet Yellen's favorite indicators. It provides a look not only at what firms are doing but also at the behavior of workers. On the business side, while hiring did slow a bit in January, the deceleration was hardly due to an unwillingness to add workers. Indeed, job openings soared and are up sharply over the year. While available positions jumped by 7.6% between January 2013 and January 2014, the pace of hiring increased by only 3.3%. That points to a backlog in hiring that should start showing up. Similarly, in the March National Federation of Independent Businesses survey, it was reported that "40 percent of the respondents indicated that there were few or no qualified candidates for open positions" and "Twenty-two (22) percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in the current period". Demand for workers is building and it is just a matter of time when the openings get filled. As for worker perceptions of conditions, a look at the quit rates points to growing confidence that jobs are becoming more readily available. While the number of quits was off in January, it was up solidly over the year. People haven't been leaving their jobs for a long time for fear of not finding another one. Now they are doing that, especially in professional and business services, where the number rose by 33% and in retail, where it was up by 16%.

MARKETS AND FED POLICY IMPLICATIONS: We will not know for months how the weather affected the economy but we can look for underlying trends and they seem to be up. The JOLTS report was hardly a great one but when you compare a reasonably decent January 2013 with an ugly January 2014 and you still get really good numbers, it does point to an improving situation. I am watching the turnover numbers, in particular, the quit rates. If they continue to rise, it will be a clear indication of growing worker confidence that the labor market is strengthening. Since it bottomed in mid-2008, the rate has increased nearly fifty percent. It is still, though, about twenty percent below the rates posted during the mid-2000s, so we still have a long way to go. I don't expect the quit rate to be near the previous peak before year's end but as it approaches it, you can expect wage gains to accelerate as businesses attempt to retain their workforce. This is something I also believe will be a factor in Janet Yellen's thinking when it comes to tapering and ultimately when to raise rates, so watch these numbers carefully. As for the markets, this report is not usually a major market mover and is not likely to be one today, especially since it is lagged and traders and investors worry about the latest number, not a delayed one. They should.##2679|Empty##2680|Prices at the wholesale level fell in February, according to a U.S. Labor Department report released Friday, leaving little worry that inflation is a problem.

The Producer Price Index declined 0.1% from the month before, the first drop since November. It has increased just under 1% from the same time a year ago.

Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the core PPI fell 0.2% in February from January. On an annual basis the core PPI is up 1.1%.

Goods prices rose 0.4% in February, for the third consecutive month. Service prices, on the other hand, fell 0.3%, the third monthly decline in the past six.

“Amid tepid and uneven demand both domestically and internationally, price pressures remain subdued,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with the investment firm Sterne Agee. “From the Federal Reserve’s standpoint, with inflation well below the 2% target and even further below the 2.5% threshold, [it] can continue to focus on a moderate pace of monthly bond purchase reductions with an option to taper the taper if labor market conditions deteriorate precipitously.”

She noted at this point there remains ample slack in the labor market with no impetus for wage pressure.

Meantime, a separate report shows consumer sentiment about the economy has weakened.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment fell to 79.9 from 81.6 the month before, its lowest reading since November. Earlier readings show it was at 81.2 in January, 82.5 in December and 75.1 in November.

Also, consumer expectations fell to 69.4 in March from 72.7 in February, also the lowest reading since November when it measured 66.8.

Surprisingly, measure of how consumers view current conditions increased to 96.1 from 95.4 in February and 96.8 in January. The index came in at 98.6 in December, and 88 in November's report.

Many analysts feel harsh winter weather and concerns about geopolitical situations and their effect on the U.S. economy may have pulled down the readings.##2681|Bitcoin is coming soon to a town near you. Or, more likely, it's already there.

The five-year-old digital currency is increasingly being adopted by brick-and mortar businesses, including dentists, pet boutiques -- even a small honey business in Utah.

In 2012, about 1,000 businesses used BitPay, the largest processor of Bitcoin payments. Today, more than 26,000 businesses worldwide use BitPay, said Tony Gallippi, its cofounder and CEO.

The majority of those firms are small businesses -- about half are in the U.S. and the rest are international. And while a majority are online sellers, Gallippi said 20% are merchants with storefronts.

Most prominent in tech hubs like San Francisco, New York and Atlanta, the shops range from bakeries and wine stores to car dealers and mattress sellers.

BitPay estimates that there are currently about 5 million active digital wallets, or Bitcoin accounts, worldwide. But the currency has had its fair share of negative headlines lately for the volatile price, underground drug market busts, high-profile hacks and calls for regulation.

"There's no government agency that's backing Bitcoin," said Jeffery Born, a finance professor at Northeastern University.

But these risks aren't deterring small businesses from embracing the virtual currency.

Craig Huntzinger started Bees Brothers in 2008 as a booth at a farmer's market in Cache Valley, Utah. Over the years, he added a line of honey-flavored caramels and launched an online store. In January 2012, Huntzinger started accepting Bitcoin for online purchases, which he promoted on a Bitcoin forum.

"Initially I was fascinated by this idea of decentralized money and wanted to support it," said Huntzinger. Then he started to appreciate some of its other benefits.

"It's fast and it makes it easy to sell to anybody in the world," he said.

It also cuts down on processing fees. Credit cards usually charge 2% to 3% in fees; BitPay and similar processors charge between 0% and 1%.

Today, about 50% of Bees Brothers transactions -- both wholesale and retail -- are done with Bitcoins. Initially, they came largely from Seattle, New York, L.A. and San Francisco. Now, he said the orders are all over the world.

Nashville's My Second Home, a high-end pet boarding and grooming business, began accepting Bitcoin in January. Chris Starko, its marketing director, said they felt it would give the business a competitive edge.

"We want to be seen as a progressive company versus our competitors," he said. "The [Bitcoin payment] process takes only a minute, allowing our customers to quickly pick up their pets and make their way home."

If it takes off, he said it could account for up to 20% of future payments. "We've had many customers tell us they appreciate it."

Bitcoin's marketing potential is a big reason small businesses are trying it out, said Born. "It's a way to attract new customers."

It's why Dr. Max Kerr, a dentist, started accepting Bitcoin three months ago at his practice outside Austin. Kerr believes it's a novel way to "put the business on the map," especially with Austin's young, tech-savvy population.

His uses BitPay to process Bitcoin transactions, which offers three options. Users can have Bitcoin payments converted into cash and deposited into their bank account, they can keep the funds as Bitcoins, or they can or opt for a combination of the two.

If merchants want to keep payments in Bitcoin, which Gallippi said less than 10% do, they need to open a digital wallet through a Bitcoin exchange.

More than half of BitPay's merchants convert the Bitcoins immediately into cash. That's what Kerr opts for, since it's a way for him to mitigate the risk.

"In 15 seconds, I'll get an email confirming the deposit," he said. "I just think of it as a cash transaction."##2682|Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.##2683|(Reuters) - Britain's Vodafone has agreed to buy Spanish cable operator Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10.03 billion) in a deal that is set to be announced on Monday, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

(Reporting by Kate Holton in London and Richa Naidu in Bangalore)##2684|The US has taken control of a stateless oil tanker seized earlier in the month by Libyan rebels, the Pentagon says.

Navy Seals boarded the tanker Morning Glory in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea near Cyprus.

Nobody was hurt in the operation, which was approved by US president Barack Obama.

The vessel, whose ownership remains a mystery, was carrying stolen Libyan crude oil from the port of Al-Sidra. Libyan officials had ordered the tanker to be confiscated, but it managed to escape.

The Pentagon said the Morning Glory will return to Libya under the control of sailors from the USS Stout. It was not clear which Libyan port the vessel was sailing for.

The Cyprus Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the tanker was in international waters off the east Mediterranean island’s southern coast since Saturday and that it was being monitored by Cypriot vessels.

The ministry said the tanker was at anchor some 18 nautical miles south of the coastal town of Limassol when US special forces took control and was now sailing “in a westward direction” under escort from US Navy ships.

The Morning Glory previously sailed under a North Korean flag, but North Korea says it has nothing to do with the ship.##2685|An important healthcare deadline is fast approaching, but many Americans appear to be either unconcerned or in the dark about how that deadline can and will affect them.

Open enrollment in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare, ends March 31. And people who haven't signed up for heath coverage by then might face a financial penalty. But according to a new survey by Bankrate (NYSE: RATE), about one-third of uninsured Americans say they'll remain uninsured.

The poll, a telephone survey of more than 3,000 Americans, found 34 percent of respondents plan to continue without health coverage. When asked why, 41 percent of those polled said health insurance was too expensive – while 17 percent said they opposed Obamacare and another 13 percent said they were healthy and didn't need such coverage.

56 percent of the uninsured people surveyed said the did plan to get health coverage under ACA. But 70 percent of those polled didn't know about subsidies available to them, to reduce the cost of health insurance.

“This is a staggeringly high percentage,” Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman said in a press statement. “The government has spent over half a billion dollars promoting the Affordable Care Act and more than two-thirds of uninsured Americans still don’t know about the subsidies. Plus, fewer than half (48%) know that the enrollment deadline is in two weeks.”

Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute, believes the Obama Administration's campaign has focused too much on the benefits of the ACA, rather than any punitive tax penalties.

"They found in Massachusetts, with 'RomneyCare' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance," she Corlette told Bankrate.com. "The Obama Administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant -- they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don't buy coverage."

China’s consumer prices rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, their slowest rate in 13 months as pork prices fell by their most in over a year, a sign that slowing growth rather than rising prices poses a risk.

Exports in February fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier, following a 10.6 percent rise in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Saturday.

No FPC research yet on possible impact of Scotland becoming independent



As far as Scottish independence is concerned, Carney suggests that the BoE would get involved only in case of it threatening the stability of the monetary framework. When asked if

the Financial Policy Committee had done any research on the possible risks connected with Scotland becoming independent, Carney answers negatively, stressing that there are other priorities.



He also says that there is a possiblity that the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move its headquarters to England is Scotland became independent and became a member of the European Union.



Getting to the bottom the FX price fixing issue of utmost importance for the BoE



The MP's then pass on to questions about the currency-manipulation scandal, which came into focus after the BoE suspended an employee following an internal investigation and released meeting minutes which revealed that policymakers were conscious of the possibility of currency traders colluding to manipulate key exchange rates.



The BoE governor assured that the central bank “acted swiftly” upon becoming aware of the case on October 16 and immediately hired a legal council. He adds that the BoE had “relentlessly followed up on allegations of FX price fixing”, suggesting however that an external person should be appointed to deal with the inquiry.



Still, Paul Fisher denies that the BoE had been aware since 2006 that exchange rates could have been manipulated, stressing that they had realized it only last year.



“It would be very odd for traders to have come to these meetings and said ‘we’ve been rigging the market, what do you think?’,” he says.



Carney assures that resolving the problem of exchange rate manipulation is of crucial importance, as BoE's credibility depends on it.##2689|Why did this happen?

The company, known for its toasted sandwiches, said it agreed to a restructuring plan that will reduce its debt by more than $400 million. It listed liabilities of between $500 million and $1 billion in its bankruptcy petition.

The Denver-based company also said in a statement that it has lined up $15 million in funding from investors to help keep the business running during bankruptcy.

The company only owns and operates seven of Quiznos' 2,100 restaurant locations in the United States and 30 other countries. Most locations are independently owned franchises and will remain open and remain unaffected by the filing, the company said.

Quiznos CEO Stuart Mathis said the company will take steps to help increase sales and profits for its franchise owners. It will look to reduce food costs, invest in local advertising and, under certain circumstances, offer loans for improvements to its restaurants.

Quiznos is the second nationwide food outlet to file for bankruptcy protection in a week. Sbarro pizza restaurants filed for its second bankruptcy in three years on Monday.

Hertz, the No. 2 U.S. car rental company behind privately owned Enterprise Rent-A-Car, has been under pressure from investors to shed the business and focus on car rentals.

The equipment business, which rents out equipment ranging from small tools to earth movers, generated revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2013, about 14 percent of Hertz’s total revenue.

The company said the spinoff would involve a one-time payment of $2.5 billion from the rental business along with a tax-free distribution to shareholders.

Hertz’s shares, which have risen 28 percent in the past year, were down 0.26 percent at $27.15 in late-afternoon trading on Tuesday.

Hertz’s remaining businesses would include the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly car rental brands and the Donlen fleet leasing and management business.

The company put in place a poison pill in December to ward off any takeover attempts at a time when activist investors such as Daniel Loeb’s Third Point Capital were buying up shares.

Hertz operates in a consolidated market, along with Avis Budget Group Inc (CAR.O) and Enterprise, which together control about 90 percent of the U.S. car rental market.

Hertz, which gets about 50 percent of its revenue from airport rentals, is expected to get a boost in 2014 as spending on business and leisure travel picks up in a recovering U.S. economy.

The new company, Hertz Equipment Rental Corp (HERC), is expected to benefit from a recovery in non-residential construction. Its biggest competitor is market leader United Rentals Inc (URI.N).

“One of the challenges or opportunities for the HERC management team post the spinoff would be to improve operational deliveries - both pricing and time utilization,” Jefferies analyst Justin Jordan said. Time utilization is a measure of the time equipment is rented out during a year.

Hertz said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter adjusted net profit fell 13 percent to $121.1 million due to lower-than-expected rental prices and higher expenses. Revenue rose 10.2 percent to $2.56 billion.

BofA Merrill Lynch and Barclays were financial advisers to Hertz for the spinoff. Jenner & Block LLP and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP provided legal counsel, while KPMG was tax adviser.

The spinoff will close by early 2015, Hertz said.##2693|Chinese Premier Li Keqiang speaks at a press conference after the closing meeting of the second annual session of China's 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, March 13, 2014.

China will not give up its efforts in searching for a missing Malaysia Airlines flight with 154 Chinese aboard "as long as there is a glimmer of hope," Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday. [Special coverage]

Li made the remarks at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session. [Special coverage]

"We will not give up any suspected clue that is being found," he said. "We are also looking very closely at all suspected clues showing on satellite images."

He said that the Chinese government has asked all relevant parties in the ongoing massive international search to enhance coordination to investigate the cause and to locate the missing plane as soon as possible.

Flight MH370 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members vanished on March 8 on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing after losing contact with air traffic control in waters between Malaysia and Vietnam.

The international search for the missing flight, which has so far involved at least 40 ships and nearly 40 aircraft from 12 countries, entered its sixth day Thursday, but the whereabouts of the Boeing 777-200 remains unknown.##2694|The recovery in developed economies is on track although slowing activity in big emerging markets means global growth will be only moderate at best in the near term, the OECD said on Tuesday.

Exceptionally bad winter weather in North America and a sales tax hike in Japan are also disrupting the pace of recovery, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.

Against that backdrop, the OECD urged the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to keep up their monetary stimulus, if not increase it, while it said the US Federal Reserve was right to begin winding down its bond-buying programme.

“The gradual recovery in the advanced economies is encouraging, even if temporary factors have pushed down growth rates in the early months of this year, while the slowdown in emerging economies is likely to be a drag on global growth,” OECD acting chief economist Rintaro Tamaki said in a statement.

Growth for major advanced economies in the first half of 2014 will be slower than in the second half of 2013, but much improved from the sluggish rates of late 2012 and early 2013, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in an update of its views on the global economy.

“Given that emerging economies now account for over half the world economy, continued sub-par economic performance for several of the major EMEs (emerging market economies) is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term,” the OECD said.

It estimated growth in the United States would slow to 1.7 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months on an annualised basis, down from 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter when exceptionally bad weather weighed on activity.

Japanese growth would surge 4.8 percent in the first quarter from the previous quarter as consumers brought forward purchases ahead of a sales tax increase on April 1.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development gave its updated forecasts as part of an interim health-check for the global economy before its much more detailed Economic Outlook due in May. It did not update its estimates for US and Japanese growth in the second quarter because one-off factors made it too problematic, it said.

Turning to Europe, the OECD saw Germany’s quarter-on-quarter annualised growth rate reaching 3.7 percent in the first quarter before slowing to 2.5 percent.

France, the euro zone’s second biggest economy after Germany, was seen growing only 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year, rising to 1 percent in the second quarter.

Outside the euro zone, the British economy was seen growing 3.3 percent in both the first and second quarters.

Turning to emerging market economies, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said some were seeing a marked loss of momentum as capital outflows exposed vulnerabilities in some countries.

It noted that Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey among others have been forced to raise interest rates to keep capital outflows in check.

Meanwhile, weak balance sheets in China raised the risk of a sharp slowdown there, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.

She hasn't highlighted one labor indicator that economists say is sounding inflation alarms: short-term unemployment.

With total joblessness at 6.7% in February, still higher than the Fed wants, the rate for those who've been out of work less than 27 weeks was just 4.2%. That's near the lowest since April 2008 and 0.6 percentage point below the average since 1948, Labor Department data show.

(Is it happening already? Treasury yields rise as job market thaws)

The depressed level suggests the U.S. labor market is tightening, raising the odds that a pick-up in wages will eventually lead to faster inflation, according to economists including Michelle Girard of RBS Securities Inc. That's important because Fed policy makers have cited a slack job market and subdued inflation as reasons for keeping short-term interest rates near zero even as the economy picks up.

“If the Fed is wrong and the labor market is tighter, firms are going to have to start at some point paying more,” said Ms. Girard, chief U.S. economist for RBS in Stamford, Conn. “Some of the Fed's comfort level — 'We can just sit with these easy money policies without any worries about future inflation' — might be called into question.”

So far there is little sign of inflation taking hold. Producer prices unexpectedly dropped 0.1% in February, held back by the biggest decrease in the cost of services in almost a year, a Labor Department report showed today. Consumer prices rose in January at a 1.2% annual rate, below the Fed's 2% target.

FED MEETING

Fed Chair Yellen and her colleagues will review their monetary strategy when they meet on March 18-19. After their last gathering in January, they said they expected to hold rates near zero “well past the time” total unemployment falls below 6.5%.

Ms. Girard and fellow economists Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Peter Hooper of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., argue the short-term unemployment rate provides a more accurate picture of tightness in the labor market.

That measure leaves aside those who have been without a job for more than 26 weeks, a group that represented 37% of the unemployed in February, compared with 16% in the 20 years before the start of the last recession.

When people are out of work for so long, they tend to become less active in seeking a job, and employers consider them less suitable for hiring, according to studies by researchers at Princeton University, Columbia University and the Boston Fed.

The implication is that large numbers of long-term unemployed don't exert much downward pressure on wages. What counts, according to Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro Research, is how many people are looking for work after having been jobless for only a few weeks or months. When their numbers dwindle, employers may have to offer higher wages to fill vacancies.

Investors are starting to pay attention. More than $350 million flowed into inflation-protected bond funds in the week ended March 5, the most since May 2012, according to data from Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global. The increase followed eight straight weekly declines.

“The overall cultural attitude among investors” may be shifting from deflation worries to concerns “about the likelihood of emerging inflationary pressures,” James Paulsen, the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management Inc., wrote in a March 11 note to clients.

Ms. Yellen, 67, told the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 27 that the Fed is moving in the direction of providing investors with qualitative guidance on its interest-rate intentions now that unemployment is closing in on the central bank's 6.5% marker.

PART-TIME WORKERS

The Fed chair suggested that the jobless rate, if anything, may understate how loose the labor market is. She pointed to the large number of people working part-time who would prefer more hours. Some 7.2 million Americans faced that predicament in February, well above the 20-year average of 5.3 million, according to seasonally adjusted Labor Department data.

In a speech last year, Ms. Yellen pointed to a number of other indicators of labor market slack, including the share of the working-age population in the labor force and the hiring rate by employers.

While Ms. Yellen hasn't drawn attention to short-term joblessness as a key indicator, some of her Fed colleagues have. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said on Feb. 19 that the drop in short-term unemployment may cause inflation to pick up more quickly than the gradual increase he currently envisions.

INFLATION RISK

“It could be that slack in labor markets is much less than assumed,” he told a meeting in New York. “I currently see this as a risk to the inflation outlook.”

New York Fed economists M. Henry Linder, Richard Peach and Robert Rich also highlighted the importance of short-duration unemployment in a Feb. 12 note, concluding that it has done “a better job” tracking changes in worker compensation than the overall jobless rate. Their boss, New York Fed President William C. Dudley, though, played down their results, saying the research was “probably a little bit too black and white.”

“I still think there is a significant amount of slack,” he said on March 6 at an event in New York. “You can see it in the fact that the compensation trends are so subdued.”

That may be changing. Average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory employees rose 2.5% in February from a year earlier, the biggest increase since October 2010, according to the Labor Department.

“Companies are starting to realize that to get good people, to prevent turnover they have to pay a decent wage,” Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO federation of 56 unions, told a Bloomberg Government breakfast on March 11.

BOOSTING SALARIES

Jeff Joerres, chief executive officer of Milwaukee-based staffing firm ManpowerGroup, has been advising some clients for more than two years to raise salaries in order to attract better talent. Only in the last nine months has the suggestion turned into a conversation, he said.

“Some markets are starting to tighten up,” Mr. Joerres said.

In the Chicago area, the salaries of mid-level jobs are inching up, said Tom Gimbel, chief executive officer of staffing firm LaSalle Network Inc. He's telling companies to raise wages now so as not to lose workers as the economy improves.

“It's become a little bit more of an employee market,” Mr. Gimbel said. “You want to retain them in advance so they don't start to look when the phones start ringing.”

The increased wage pressure isn't surprising given the drop in short-term joblessness. Based on that measure, full employment — the rate at which inflation remains steady — is about 4.6%, the New York Fed economists found. If joblessness is below that level — as it is now — worker compensation should pick up as companies are forced to pay higher wages for the employees they want.

Research by Alan Krueger, a professor at Princeton University in New Jersey, and Andreas Mueller of the Columbia Business School in New York shows why the duration of joblessness is important. They found that the amount of time out-of-work Americans devoted to job hunting fell sharply the longer they were unemployed. The results were based on weekly interviews with 6,025 jobless workers in New Jersey in 2009 and 2010.

Companies also are less inclined to take on the long-term unemployed, according to research by Rand Ghayad, a visiting scholar at the Boston Fed. In 2012, he sent out 4,800 fictional résumés that were identical in all aspects except length of unemployment and industry experience. Those out of work for a long stretch received very few invitations for interviews from prospective employers.

Up to a point, Fed policy makers would probably welcome a rise in wages and inflation, which is below their target, said Hooper, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities.

“I don't think there is any reason” for the Fed to worry now, he said. “Later this year, it's going to be more of an issue” as the economy strengthens and unemployment falls more.

A day after Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM), subsidiary of Japanese auto major Toyota Motor Corporation, declared a lockout at its main production base at Bidadi, there appeared to be no end in sight to the simmering year-long dispute over a deal on wage revision.

Although the union, the Toyota Kirloskar Motor Employees Union, and the management told The Hindu that they were scheduled to meet the Karnataka Labour Minister P. T. Parameshwar Naik on Tuesday, they said a deal did not appear imminent.

Shekar Viswanathan, Vice-Chairman and Director, TKM, said at a media conference on Tuesday that while the workers wanted a wage hike of an average of Rs.4,000 a month, the same as what they got in 2011-12, the company’s “final offer” was only a hike of Rs.3,050 a month. Terming the union’s demand as “sky high,” Mr. Viswanathan said, the “steep depreciation” of the rupee, slackening demand for vehicles had resulted in “an overhang of excess supply.” Mr. Viswanathan confirmed the union’s claim that the company had agreed to an average hike of Rs.4,000 per worker at the last annual settlement.

Mr. Viswanathan pointed out that the company was at present operating with a capacity of only 110,000 vehicles per annum compared to the installed capacity of 310,000 vehicles a year. “As a result of all these factors, labour supply is not in line with the productive capacity at the plant,” he said. “We have even stopped increments for senior personnel,” he claimed.

Admitting that a series of 15 meetings over the last year had proved futile, Mr. Viswanathan said, the lockout was sparked off by the “line stops” at the plant and “some acts of sabotage” on the shop floors at the two plants in Bidadi in the last 25 days had resulted in the “loss of 2,000 units of planned output.”

He admitted that since TKM normally maintained a very low inventory level, the possible shortage of its vehicles in showrooms “is a matter of concern.” Asked if the company was adopting an intransigent position over wages, Mr. Viswanathan said the wages at TKM were linked to the “Toyota ecosystem” near Bangalore, which includes 15-16 suppliers.

Both company sources as well as those of the union told The Hindu that the “ecosystem” employs more than 15,000 workers.

“The wage level at TKM is also linked to the floor wage rate in plants operated by suppliers,” said Prasanna Kumar C., President, TKM Employee Union. The two plants employed about 5,000 workers, including about 500 on contract, a company source said.##2698|It’s refreshing to hear an executive operating in the brutal market for teen/young adult retail admit that its problems don’t stem from youth unemployment, the weather or the internet, but rather, bad fashion calls.”When the fashion did change, a number of people, including us, didn’t call the fashion as well as we could have,” Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne said on a conference call late yesterday.

Urban Outfitters reported record fourth quarter sales and earnings last night, but this was mainly driven by strong performance at its Anthropologie stores (where sales from stores open for at least a year were up 10%) and its Free People stores (up 20%.) The Urban Outfitters chain continues to struggle: same-store sales were down 9%. The company’s share price has fallen by about 5% this morning.

Here’s an even more detailed assessment from Hayne on the challenges facing the company’s main brand.

“There are no fundamental structural changes in the young adult market other than the disruption caused by the internet and mobile technologies, both of which, we have been discussing now for many years,. This market is highly competitive,but I believe the theories which correlate demographic shifts, poor employment numbers, online tipping points, or other similar factors to the difficult sales in the young adult market are off point. Sales correlate directly with fashion hits and misses, and I believe the Urban brand has had fewer hits than normal. It’s that simple.”

You will recall that there has been some concern among analysts that the Urban Outfitters chain is pushing the boundaries a little too far with some of its designs.

It turns out those concerns were warranted. The challenge for the company is to improve the ”accuracy of the fashion call ” which will help it elevate the brand from a “fashion and quality perspective,” Hayne said.

Fortunately, it could be well positioned to exploit the next seismic shift in fashion—the anticipated popularity of high-waisted jeans in mainstream America. Goldman analysts argue that Urban Outfitters eventually came to profit from skinny jeans and could benefit from the next shift.##2699|New York based high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial is slated to go public, having filed the required regulatory disclosures today. The firm, which was co-founded 12 years ago by chairman Vincent Viola—who recently bought the National Hockey League’s Florida Panthers—reported profits of $184 million in 2013, 108% higher than the prior year.

Virtu is just one of a number of so-called electronic market makers which have devoured the business of matching investor buy-and-sell orders and collecting a profit based on the discrepancy between the two. Humans—such as the New York Stock Exchange’s specialists—once had the job. But in recent years, high-frequency trading such as Virtu have gobbled up the business. These companies are known for using super-charged computers and sophisticated algorithms to quickly take advantage of small price changes.

While markets have been growing increasingly more electronic for decades, electronic-trading emerged as a potential risk to market stability following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash,” when a breakdown in computerized trading systems sent US stocks down 10% in moments. The episode—along with a number of other electronic trading glitches, such as Facebook’s botched 2012 IPO—have repeatedly been blamed for undermining investor confidence in US markets.

According to the Financial Times, a successful IPO would make Virtu, essentially, the first electronic trading firm to go public. (There are publicly traded firms such as Nasdaq OMX have large electronic trading operations.) And while The Wall Street Journal reported that Virtu could go public as early as next month, a scott-free offering is by no means guaranteed. (When a computerized stock exchange by the name of BATS tried to go public on its own exchange in 2012, hilarity ensued.)

At any rate, in its SEC filing Virtu took pains to stress the many levels of risk management that will enable it to avoid issues that have plagued electronic traders such as Knight Capital, whose haywire trading algorithm nearly sent the company into bankruptcy back in 2012. (Knight ultimately merged with another electronic outfit.) Virtu even pointed out that the company had recorded only a single day of trading losses in the 1,238 trading days that comprise the period between Jan. 1, 2009 and and Dec. 31, 2013, attributing that track record to its “real-time risk management strategy and technology.”##2700|Pentagon: U.S. Navy SEALs Board Tanker Hijacked in Libya

March 17 (Reuters) – U.S. Navy SEALs boarded and took control of an oil tanker late on Sunday that had was seized earlier this month at a Libyan port by three armed men, the U.S. Department of Defense said.

No one was hurt in the boarding operation, approved by U.S. President Barack Obama, requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments and conducted in international waters southeast of Cyprus, said Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby.

"The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra," his statement said.

Bloomin' 'eck there is a bewildering game of musical chairs going on at the Bank of England this morning. And pretty much every big job there, bar the very top one, is changing in some way.

I will summarise what I see as the main events.

For the second time in its history, the Bank of England has appointed a woman to a top policy job, as Minouche Shafik takes the newly created post of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking (Rachel Lomax was the first female deputy governor, a few years back).

What's most interesting about the Shafik appointment - other than its gender (the Bank has been such a boys' club) - is how the governor, Mark Carney, has raided the responsibilities of three other big jobs to carve out the role.

She'll take the seat on the Monetary Policy Committee currently occupied by Paul Fisher, the bank's executive director for markets (who looks likes the main loser from this reorganisation).

And she will also assume chunky duties from the other two deputy governors, those for monetary policy and financial stability - namely that she will be the main negotiator with the G7 group of leading economies and the IMF (currently a monetary policy responsibility), and with overseas central banks and the Bank for International Settlements (nicked from financial stability).

But what was most interesting about the description of her job was this: "Dr Shafik will be responsible for reshaping the Bank's operations and balance sheet, including robust risk management practices and helping to lead the design and execution of an eventual exit from quantitative easing by the Monetary Policy Committee".

In other words, as and when the Bank of England starts to offload that £375bn of government debt it bought, in its unprecedented exercise to create new money and keep interest rates at record lows after the crash, she'll be responsible for preventing a collapse in the price of that debt that could hobble both the Bank of England and commercial banks.

No stress there then.

And although she is a very high powered person, as deputy managing director of the IMF since April 2011 and prior to that permanent secretary at the Department for International Development, the cut and thrust of markets will be new to her.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ben Broadbent is replacing Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy

What else is happening in Threadneedle Street?

Well another Goldman Sachs alumnus rises to the top of the Bank to join Mr Carney - with the appointment of Ben Broadbent to replace Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy.

Broadbent was already on the Bank of England's interest-rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, but before that he was Goldman's senior European economist.

In practice Broadbent becomes the top economist at the Bank. But there is also a change in the holder of what the Bank calls its chief economist post, with Andy Haldane taking that job.

Haldane is in fact doing a job swap, with his exact Bank of England contemporary Spencer Dale (I think they joined on the same day as young graduates).

So Dale takes Haldane's job as executive director for financial stability.

It is certainly interesting that Haldane is staying at the Bank, because it was widely felt that his relations with Mr Carney are poor - since Haldane's ideas on how to cleanse and stabilise the banking system were rather more radical than Mr Carney's.

And Mr Haldane - regarded as one of the more creative and insightful economists of his generation - has been unwontedly quiet on the City reform agenda in recent months.

Finally one of the more distinguished of the UK's industrialists, Anthony Habgood, will replace Sir David Lees as chair of the Court of the Bank of England (the Bank's pompous historic name for its board).

He has the job of making sure Mr Carney - with all the many new responsibilities he's been given by the chancellor, for making sure the financial system and banks don't fall over again - doesn't go power mad.

Mr Carney himself will lay out his own cunning plan to knit together the newly huge and amorphous Bank of England in the Mais Lecture, later today.

And although you may feel a wave of torpor sweeping over you, at just the thought of a speech about governance and structure at the Bank, it may be sensible to stay awake.

Because how the Bank of England executes its complicated mandate, of keeping inflation low and financial stability high, affects the prosperity of us all.

UPDATE 15:40

Inside the Bank of England, the scale of the personnel changes is causing a tiny bit of internal handwringing, as one or two backs are perhaps put out.

So here is a little ouch from one of its people: "Minouche won't be the lead international person on everything. For example, on the international financial reform programme, Jon Cunliffe [the current deputy governor of financial stability] will take the lead in G20 and Financial Stability Board.

"Jon will also be on the board of the Bank for International Settlements. It's a detail, but an important one."

Of course.

And as for the apparent demotion to Paul Fisher, it may be that his job has been downgraded rather than the bloke himself - if you catch my drift. We shall see.##2704|Empty##2705|Empty##2706|DETROIT — General Motors’ executives and government regulators will soon have to explain to Congress why it took years to recall 1.6 million compact cars with a known defect linked to 13 deaths. And the Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response, according to a person briefed on the matter.

Members of two congressional committees will likely ask why a proposed fix to the problem was never implemented and why GM didn’t immediately tell car owners about the defect. Here’s a look at the developments so far in the recall and what’s ahead.

Q. Which cars is GM recalling?

A. GM is recalling a total of 1.6 million vehicles that were sold in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The recall includes the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 from the 2005-2007 model years; the Saturn Ion from the 2003-2007 model years; and the Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky from the 2006-2007 model years.

Q. What’s the defect?

A. GM says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power. That can knock out power-assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags.

Q. What is GM doing to fix the problem?

A. Dealers will replace the ignition switches for free. GM will notify owners when the parts are available and repairs can begin, likely in April. Until then, it is warning owners to remove all items from their key rings, including key fobs if applicable. Only the vehicle key should be left on the ring.

Q. Have any deaths or accidents been linked to this defect?

A. The problem has been linked to 31 crashes and 13 front-seat deaths. In each of the fatal crashes, the air bags did not inflate. The engines did not shut off in all cases.

Q. When did GM first know about this problem?

A. In 2004, around the time that the Chevrolet Cobalt first went on sale, GM learned of at least one engine losing power and started investigating the problem. By 2007, it had received more reports, including at least one involving a fatal accident. According to a company timeline that was given to NHTSA, the company approved a redesign of the key head in 2005 but later cancelled that plan. The company also alerted dealers that an insert on the key head could fix the problem, but warranty records show only 474 customers have gotten the insert.

Q. Why didn’t GM act more quickly?

A. GM opened at least two investigations after reports of engine stalling but closed them after taking no action. At the time, the company was juggling eight U.S. brands and losing billions each year, which led to its eventual bankruptcy in 2009. Now, GM has cut excess brands and bureaucracy and is solidly profitable. GM’s new CEO has promised “an unvarnished” investigation into what happened.

Q. Did GM report these incidents to the government?

A. Yes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also received dozens of complaints from owners about the issue, dating as far back as 2005. NHTSA conducted several investigations into the problem but never ordered a recall.

Q. Why is Congress investigating?

A. Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote a 2000 law that was intended to improve communication between automakers and NHTSA and help NHTSA identify potential threats to consumers’ safety. He wants to know if GM or NHTSA missed opportunities to fix the problem sooner, or if the legislation needs to be strengthened.

Q. What actions can the government take if it finds GM didn’t act quickly enough?

A. NHTSA can fine GM up to US$35 million. Automakers are required to report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them. Congress doubled the maximum fine to US$35 million last year and could increase it further.

Q. What’s at stake for GM?

A. It’s unclear how much the recall will cost. Toyota Motor Corp. paid US$48.8 million in total fines to the U.S. government for its handling of unintended acceleration recalls. It later paid more than US$1 billion to settle a lawsuit from owners claiming their cars lost value. It still faces other lawsuits.

The case will also hurt GM’s efforts to break from its pre-bankruptcy past. Older, less reliable products still on the road could still haunt GM.

Q. Where can I get more information?

Owners may contact Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020, Pontiac at 1-800-762-2737 or Saturn at 1-800-553-6000. They may also contact NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153) or go to www.safercar.gov.##2707|Empty##2708|"Fernando Valdez, 25, of El Paso, N.M., woke up early on Saturday, after his mother insisted that he walk to an enrollment center and enroll in marketplace coverage," Tavenner's blog said. "Now, he will pay $22 a month for his health insurance. Fernando said that he walked away knowing that if 'I get into an accident I will not be in trouble with trying to find health care.' "



Tavenner's agency did not disclose how many of the 5 million enrollees have paid for their insurance plans, which is required for enrollment to be official, and for benefits to be provided to a person. Insurance industry experts have estimated that between 15 to 20 percent of enrollees have not paid yet, and one expert told CNBC.com he expects that after open enrollment closes, about 10 percent of Obamacare ernollees will end up not paying for the plans they selected.

CMS also did not disclose what percentage of the 5 million sign-ups have come from people who previously had insurance. Obamacare critics have claimed that the bulk of enrollments have come from the previously insured, as opposed to the uninsured that the health-care reform law is supposed to be helping the most.

Obama administration officials last year predicted that about 7 million people would enroll in health plans sold on the exchanges by the end of this March. But after it took months to recover from the disastrous Oct. 1 launch of HealthCare.gov and a number of state-run exchanges, which suffered from badly botched software designs, officials revised their estimate down to 6 million.

AP investigation: Drug prices going up despite Trump promise##2711|China's economy slowed markedly in the first two months of the year, with growth in investment, retail sales and factory output all falling to multi-year lows, a surprisingly weak performance that raises the spectre of a sharper cooldown.

The weaker-than-expected data is bound to amplify global investors' worries about slackening growth in the world's second-largest economy, and will almost certainly feed speculation that Beijing may loosen policies soon to bolster growth.

China's industrial output rose 8.6 percent in the first two months of 2014 from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, missing market expectations for a 9.5 percent rise.

That marked the worst performance for China's factory output growth since April 2009.

"Policy easing should be imminent," said Hao Zhou, an economist at ANZ Bank in Shanghai, adding that Thursday's data implied that China's economy may grow 7 percent in the first quarter.

Sources told Reuters earlier this week that China's central bank is prepared to take its strongest action since 2012 to loosen monetary policy if economic growth slows further, by cutting the amount of cash that banks must keep as reserves.

A cut would be triggered if growth slips below 7.5 percent and towards 7.0 percent, and would be expected only in the second quarter, according to the sources who are involved in internal policy discussions.

Other sectors of the economy also appeared to have lost steam.

Growth in retail sales was the slowest in three years, up 11.8 percent in January and February compared to the year-ago period. Analysts had expected a rise of 13.5 percent.

Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, fared even worse. It was up 17.9 percent in the first two months from the same period last year, a level unseen in 11 years and some way below forecasts for a 19.4 percent increase.

Asian stock markets and most regional currencies such as the Australian dollar and China's offshore yuan pared early gains after the data was released.

COOLING, BUT HOW FAST

The statistics bureau released combined data for January and February in a bid to reduce distortions seen in single-month data caused by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays, when factories, offices and shops often close for long periods.

Trade data last week showed January-February exports fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier, and tumbled 18.1 percent in February alone, alarming financial markets.

Many analysts believe Beijing will not consider further easing until more months of data are available.

But even accounting for holiday-related shutdowns and distortions, the broader weaker trend so far in 2014 appears clear.

China's government, which wrapped up its annual parliament meeting on Thursday, had said last week that it aims to grow the economy by 7.5 percent this year.

But with growth appearing to drop faster and sharper than what many have expected, some economists believe that China may actually miss its growth target this year for the first time in years.

Even government officials are hinting that the target is not cast in stone, in what may be an attempt to guide market expectations lower. Finance Minister Lou Jiwei and Premier Li Keqiang have both said that the target is flexible.##2712|Talk to a domain expert: 1-303-893-0552

U.S. stocks ended lower at Wall Street on Tuesday, 11 March 2014 as investors appeared to take a pause in a day light on economic data releases. Energy and materials stocks led broad-based losses on the benchmark S&P 500. Equities indices started the day with modest gains and spent the first two hours of action in the neighborhood of their flat lines.

At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 67.43 points, or 0.4%, lower at 16,351.25. The Nasdaq Composite fell for the fourth consecutive day, ending down 27.26 points, or 0.6%, at 4,307.19. The S&P 500 ended the day 9.55 points, or 0.5%, lower at 1,867.62, retreating from a record closing level reached on Friday.

The Ukraine matter is still a worry among traders and investors and has moved closer to the front burner of the market place.

U.S. economic data released Tuesday was on the light side and failed to move the markets. Wholesale inventories increased 0.6% in January after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.3%) in December. The consensus pegged inventory growth at 0.4%. Inventory growth in the durables sector slowed, increasing 0.4% in January after a 1.2% gain in December. Nondurable inventories rose 0.8% in January after falling 0.9% in December. Unfortunately, the strong gain in inventories was likely not planned. Sales, which edged up a slight 0.1% in December, crashed in January and fell 1.9%.

Among individual stocks, retailers were in the spotlight. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters tumbled 7.8% after fourth-quarter profit and outlook disappointed. Shares of Urban Outfitters fell 4.3% after the company reported results on Monday that revealed a drop in fourth-quarter same-store sales late Monday. But Macy's and J.C. Penney rallied after an upgrade from analysts.

Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods rose 4.3% after the company posted results that largely met forecasts.

Treasuries held modest intraday losses, but jumped to highs as the market slid into the red. The benchmark 10-yr yield ended lower by two basis points at 2.76%.

Bullion prices ended mixed at Comex on Tuesday, 11 March 2014. Gold prices ended the U.S. day session moderately higher Tuesday, on some more safe-haven demand that surfaced amid the simmering geopolitical situation in Ukraine. Gold futures on Tuesday settled near $1,350 an ounce, scoring a second-consecutive session gain as worries over Ukraine and concerns surrounding a slowdown in Chinese economic growth lifted the metal's safe-haven appeal for investors.

Gold for April delivery rose $5.20, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,346.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier touching a high of $1,353. May silver shed 9.5 cents, or 0.5%, to $20.815 an ounce after a minor loss in the previous session.

Crude oil futures fell more than 1% on Tuesday, 11 March 2014 to settle at their lowest level in a month with traders unable to fully shake off worries about a slowdown in China's economy and betting on a rise in weekly U.S crude inventories. Crude for April delivery fell $1.09, or 1.1%, to settle at $100.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Indian ADRs ended mostly lower on Tuesday. In the IT space, Infosys was down 0.03% at $59.63 and Wipro shed 0.88% at $13.53. In the banking space, ICICI Bank was down 0.75% at $40.95 and HDFC Bank fell 2.25% at $37.37. In the other sectors, Tata Motors slipped 1.44% at $33.59 and Dr Reddy's Laboratories rose 1.74% at $44.38.

March 10 (UPI) -- Colorado is rolling in the (cookie) dough.

The tax figures are in, and in the first month of recreational pot sales, the state pulled in $2.1 million in tax revenue and fees, plus an additional $1.4 million from medical marijuana.

Figures published by the state Department of Revenue show $14 million worth of pot was sold in January, the first month Colorado's first-in-the-nation law legalizing marijuana for recreational use was in effect.

"This is revenue directly out of the hands of cartels," said Brian Vicente, who helped pass the law. "These tax numbers will probably grow over time, but since it's a new market, will have to wait and see."

January's numbers were skewed downward, thanks to the small number of stores ready to do business on day one, but skewed up as customers rushed to be among the first to buy their weed legally.

The office of Gov. John Hickenlooper predicted total taxes and fees would exceed $35 million by June and $188 million in the fiscal year beginning July.

The law, passed by voters in November, requires the first $40 million raised to go to school construction and improvement.

[9News]##2717|WASHINGTON, D.C. (WKZO) -- The recall of 1.6-million General Motors vehicles for ignition switch problems is now under investigation by the Justice Department according to sources speaking to the "Detroit News."

This isn’t the first time. When Russia cut off natural gas supplies in 2009 to Ukraine and six other countries in the middle of winter, millions were left in the cold until they paid Russia’s ransom in the form of higher prices. It was a stark example how vulnerable Europe had become to Russia’s control over energy resources. I said at the time it should be a wake-up call to an America confronting its own foreign oil dependence issue and the national security and economic threats that come with it.

We rely on oil suppliers around the world for half of the oil we use. Our OPEC oil dependence is particularly troubling. We’re caught in OPEC’s web that has entangled us in wars and Middle East politics and costing thousands of American lives and trillions of tax dollars.

I launched the Pickens Plan to help America get free from dangerous oil and make sure energy could never again be used as a weapon against us. I’ve urged America to use our vast domestic resources to create a real alternative to OPEC oil, and natural gas is the only resource to do that. But now it seems like everyone with a microphone is calling on the United States to begin exporting natural gas to Europe to undercut Russia’s power over the region.

I have nothing against exporting American natural gas – thanks to hydro-fracturing and horizontal drilling we’ve got more of it than anyone else in the world – but it’s foolish to think we can just turn on the tap and expect Russia to melt like the Wicked Witch. Realistically, it will be early 2016 at best before any of the permitted liquefied natural gas export facilities come on line. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and Russia’s expansion plans can’t be thwarted with our energy overnight.

Russia is the world’s second-largest supplier of oil and has tremendous power over the market. While America’s oil and natural gas industry has achieved stunning increases in domestic production, this has done nothing to alleviate our vulnerability to foreign oil. Russia’s intrusion into Ukraine last week caused our prices to spike $3 in a single day. This dangerous dependence makes us just as vulnerable to state-sponsored energy-terrorism as Ukraine, which is why we can’t liberate Europe from its dependence until we’ve freed ourselves first.

The fact is, the only way American can reclaim control of its foreign policy is to take advantage of our own resources. The best way to make a big difference quickly is to transition heavy-duty trucks from diesel to natural gas. That is beginning to happen. More and more trucking, delivery, and refuse and recycling companies are switching to natural gas – compressed or liquid. All up and down our Interstate highway system LNG and CNG fueling islands are sprouting up. It’s a great start, but we need to do more.

We should step back, look at all our resources and build a real plan to make the highest and best use of them right here at home. Reducing our dependence on dangerous oil will do more than just make America safer and stronger, it will lower demand and hit Russia where it really hurts: In the value of its oil and gas exports. Long-term strategic thinking and energy planning can be used to cripple foreign governments. President Reagan proved that in 1982 when he worked with Saudi Arabia and encouraged them to overproduce oil, ultimately collapsing oil prices...and Russia. It’s unlikely we have that same card to play with the Saudi’s today, and it would bust our domestic industry anyway. But we do have other cards to play, and natural gas as a fuel substitute for OPEC oil is the trump card.

Putin’s invasion of Crimea shouldn’t be fodder for the cable chat shows, it should be a rallying cry for American energy policy. It should remind us that we are blessed with enormous natural gift and we should have a plan to properly use those resources to be sure foreign oil can never again be used as a weapon of war.##2722|NEW YORK (AP) -- The jacket finally fits: Men's Wearhouse is buying rival Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.

The agreement ends a months-long back and forth. The combined company will have more than 1,700 U.S. stores. And the Jos. A. Bank outlets will keep their name and possibly keep their "buy one suit and get three free" deals.

Men's Wearhouse Inc. announced Tuesday that it will pay $65 per share, a 5 percent premium to Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc.'s most recent closing price.

Jos. A. Bank got the ball rolling in October when it offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billion. Men's Wearhouse scoffed at that offer, and turned the tables, offering to buy its rival for $1.54 billion.

By early March, Men's Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 per share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 per share if some conditions were met.

Jos. A. Bank also said Tuesday that it was terminating its deal to acquire the parent company of Eddie Bauer, which sells rugged outerwear. That deal was announced on Feb. 14, but Jos. A. Bank left the door open. It said that if it received a superior acquisition offer, it would pay a termination fee to end the Eddie Bauer deal.

"Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos. A. Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach," Doug Ewert, president and CEO of Men's Wearhouse, said in a statement.

Both companies said that the deal would complement each other's business models, and better serve an expanded customer base in more locations and improve its sourcing and merchandising capabilities.

They expect a smooth integration with no rebranding or remodeling required. Jos. A. Bank's store banner will remain in place.

Jos. A. Bank, based in Hampstead, Md., sells men's tailored and casual clothing, sportswear and operates 623 stores in 44 states and the District of Columbia.

About a third of uninsured Americans plan to stay uninsured, according to a new report by Bankrate.com.

The reason they intend to remain uninsured? Cost.

But about 70 percent of those planning to stay uninsured said they didn’t know about the subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act that may lower the cost of coverage, according to a CBS News story.

“This is a staggeringly high percentage,” Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman told CBS News. “The government has spent over half a billion dollars promoting the Affordable Care Act, and more than two-thirds of uninsured Americans still don’t know about the subsidies.”

About 46 percent of those surveyed for the report were unaware of the March 31 deadline for being insured, according to CBS News. (For local folks unaware of the deadline, here’s a recent Columbian story with more info).

Here are some other interesting stats from the report, according to the CBS article:

- More than 40 percent of people who identified themselves as Republicans said there are no tax credits to lessen the cost. That compares with 20 percent of Democrats and 33 percent of independents.

- More than a third of people in both the west and south said tax credits didn’t exist.

- About 17 percent said they were staying uninsured because they oppose the ACA.

- Of those between 18 and 29 years old, about a third said they don’t plan to obtain insurance because they’re healthy and don’t need it.

Comments##2724|In 2014, AL.com is looking beyond political battle lines to examine how the Affordable Care Act is affecting the cost, availability and quality of health care in Alabama. We asked what it means to you, and you’ve responded.

Name: Alan Gurganus

Age: 36

City: Irondale

His situation: Gurganus, the director of recycling at the Alabama Environmental Council, checked out the healthcare.gov site soon after it opened in October and experienced its well-documented glitches.

"It was very frustrating," Gurganus said.

Meanwhile, he said, he learned that his Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama health insurance premium payment was going to go up about $100 per month -- from $180 to $280.

After having allowed about six weeks for the Affordable Care Act website to get fixed, he tried again. He got all the way through the process and at the end, he still couldn't see the plans offered. More frustration.

But he persevered and eventually found a plan on the exchange for about $240 that matched the coverage he had. So even though it was more than his original premium of $180, Gurganus is pleased to have saved $40 from what he would have been paying outside the exchange. On top of that, the deductible on the ACA Silver plan he chose is about $1,500 less, he said, while prescription drugs and co-pay remain unchanged.

He did not qualify for a subsidy via tax credits.

What it means: It's likely that Gurganus' original plan's premium increased due to some of the effects of the Affordable Care Act. The law doesn't allow for insurers to deny or charge more for preexisting conditions anymore, for example. In states like Alabama where medical underwriting, as it is called, was prevalent, many premiums were bound to go up. By going on the exchange, however, Gurganus was able to ameliorate that price hike by finding a plan that matched his coverage and was $40 less expensive than what was offered to him outside the exchange.

His view: "Overall, I'm happy to be spending less for good health insurance, but I'm most appreciative of the fact that friends and family and fellow Americans with preexisting conditions now have access to health insurance," Gurganus said.

But Gurganus said the process was exasperating at times.

"I was able to keep my cool by reminding myself that this is a government program,' Gurganus said. "I've never seen a government program that works efficiently, at least at the beginning. For me it turned out well in the end."

Vodafone has confirmed it is moving further into the European market today (March 17th), after the company announced the purchase of a competitor from Spain.

The firm revealed it has set up a deal to buy the Spanish cable operator Ono, with the agreement reported to be worth as much as 7.2 billion euros (£6 billion).

Vodafone has been making serious strides into the European market in the last few months and the purchase of Ono comes only a few months after the company confirmed it had bought a controlling stake in German cable operator Kabel.

The company is cash-rich at the present time as a result of the massive sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless, which allowed it to raise £84 billion. Vodafone is now planning to spend around £25 billion of this windfall on strengthening its position as one of the leading telecoms operators in Europe.

Ono future

Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of Ono's board of directors, said the enlarged business is going to help to "drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry".

Ono's private equity owners had been considering a plan to float the company on the Madrid stock exchange, but Vodafone was able to jump in and get a deal done for the firm before any proposals could be approved by the company.

Vodafone is already one of Europe's strongest mobile phone and cable operators and investors will now be keeping a close eye on the company to see which rivals it looks to snap up in the next few months.

In the early stages of trading this morning on the London Stock Exchange, the share price of Vodafone is slightly up compared to the start of the session. By 08:29 GMT, stocks in the firm were more than one per cent up for the day and were still rising steadily.

Last month, Vodafone revealed that it now has 500,000 customers on its Red 4G plans, with the announcement being made by the firm just six months after they went on sale.

Find up to date information on the FTSE 100 and spread betting strategies at City Index##2727|Gold futures soared to the strongest level in almost six months after speculation China’s economic growth is losing momentum hurt equities, fueling demand for haven assets at a time when tension between Russia and Ukraine escalates. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed ETF, were unchanged yesterday, holding at the highest level since December 20th.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for settlement in April surged by 0.8% to trade at $1 357.60 per troy ounce by 07:50 GMT. Prices touched a session high at $1 363.20 per troy ounce, the strongest since September 20, while day’s low was touched at $1 345.70 an ounce.

Bullion advanced 0.6% yesterday, extending a fifth weekly gain last week, as tension between Russia and Ukraine escalated, spurring demand for haven assets, including gold.

Gold futures are up 13% this year and capped the first back-to-back monthly increase in February since August, amid concern the economic growth of the largest bullion consumer, China, may slow, while unrest in Ukraine hurt emerging market assets already weakened by reductions in Fed stimulus, boosting demand for the precious metal as a store of value. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of equities plunged 1.5% today, before data tomorrow forecast to reveal Chinese industrial production slowed its pace last month.

At the same time, the parliament of the southern Ukrainian region, Crimea voted yesterday that the Black Sea peninsula will declare itself an independent state if its residents approve a March 16 referendum on splitting from Ukraine and joining the Russian Federation as Western leaders threaten sanctions.

“Gold is getting support from geopolitical events and falling equity markets, but there’s little follow-through from physical buyers at these levels,” said Lv Jie, an analyst at Cinda Futures Co., a unit of one of four funds in China created to buy bad debt from banks, cited by Bloomberg. “Investors continue to watch U.S. economic data for direction.”

Chinese demand

On the Shanghai Gold Exchange, trading volumes for spot bullion of 99.99 percent purity have exceeded the fourth quarters daily average of about 11 525 kilograms every day since March 5th.

Higher bullion prices have hurt demand in China, which according to data by the World Gold Council released in February, overtook India as the largest global consumer last year, consuming a record 1 066 tons.

Fed stimulus outlook

Bullion prices were pressured earlier in the week after two Fed officials commented that the hurdle rate to alter the pace of Fed stimulus cuts was too high.

Fed President of Philadelphia Charles Plosser, who is a voting member this year, commented on Monaday that the recent batch of strong US economic data wasn’t enough to alter the pace of the central bank asset purchases. His statement was later echoed by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who will not vote on policy this year.

“Given the fact that we’ve embarked on measured reductions, it’s important to give some certainty or at least clarity to the markets on what we’re doing,” Plosser said in a Bloomberg interview. “It’s OK to continue at 10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction.”

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last month that central bank’s officials were “open to reconsidering” the pace of reductions in monthly bond purchase, should the economy falter, in contrast with her comments made earlier in February, that US economy has gained enough strength in order to withstand reduction of monetary stimulus.

At the same time, Fed officials will try to determine whether the weakness economy has recently demonstrated is due to temporary factors, before their next policy meeting scheduled for March 18-19th.

The central bank announced in December that it will pare monthly bond-buying purchases by $10 billion, after which it decided on another reduction of the same size at the meeting on policy in January, underscoring that labor market indicators, which “were mixed but on balance showed further improvement”, while nation’s economic growth has “picked up in recent quarters.”

Federal Reserve will probably continue to pare stimulus by $10 billion at each policy meeting before exiting the program in December, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 41 economists, conducted on January 10th.

Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed ETP, were unchanged at 812.70 tons on Tuesday, the strongest level since December 20th. Holdings in the fund are 0.9% up this year after it has lost 41% of its assets in 2013, that wiped almost $42 billion in value. A total of 553 tons has been withdrawn last year. Billionaire hedge-fund manager John Paulson who holds the biggest stake in the SPDR Gold Trust told clients at the end of last year that he wouldn’t invest more money in his gold fund because it isn’t clear when inflation will accelerate. However, a government report revealed that the owner of the largest stake in the SPDR Gold Trust, kept his holdings unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2013.##2728|Just days after the head of the Russian state-owned company Gazprom threatened to cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine, officials say the energy company is likely to increase prices by about 37 percent.

Prices could rise from $268.50 to $368.50 per 1,000 cubic meters of the fuel in the second quarter, Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Prodan said on Sunday, as reported by Interfax news agency.

Since ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia in late February, Ukraine hasn't paid its gas bill that the company said is worth $2 billion.

“Either Ukraine makes good on its debt and pays for current supplies, or there is risk of returning to the situation of early 2009,” Gazprom’s CEO Alexei Miller threatened on Friday. Gazprom in 2009 cut gas supplies to Ukraine over price disputes.

In light of the recent threats, Ukraine has remained silent especially as Russian troops threaten military force on Ukraine’s autonomous region of Crimea.

Yanukovych agreed in December to a $15 billion Russian aid package, which included a 30 percent discount on natural gas. Many Ukrainians saw this as an exchange for backing out of a deal that would integrate Ukraine more closely with the European Union. With Yanukovych out, the deal with Moscow was left in doubt.

Interestingly enough, some energy security experts believe that Russia’s threats may be empty as it may lose money if it follows up on cutting supplies. It's also one reason why experts believe Russia will deescalate the conflict.

If gas supplies are disrupted or if tensions escalate further, it could cost OAO Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) $20 billion and eliminate $6 billion worth of customs duties for Russia, possibly bankrupting the company, Mikhail Korchemkin, the executive director of East European Gas Analysis, told International Business Times.

That means there will be less revenue for a company that makes up nearly 8 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product as well as a significant portion of the state's budget revenues, and that’s why Russia believes “Gazprom is more valuable than Crimea,” Korchemkin said.

But if Russia did decided to shut off gas supplies, the European Union's executive arm said it would assist Ukraine by reversing existing flows back to Kiev.

“In the short term, the [European] Commission is ready to assist Ukraine in diversifying its gas supply routes, notably by ensuring that reverse flows with the EU, notably via Slovakia [in addition to Poland and Hungary, as is currently the case], can be operationalized as soon as possible,” the commission said.

Big Money in Whistle Blowing: The U.S. government announced it will award J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) whistleblower Keith Edwards a staggering $63.9 million for his assistance. Edwards provided tips about the bank's alleged scheme to offer false data and information since 2002 to the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The sum represents more than 10% of the total figure that the company paid last month in a $614 million settlement over its mortgage lending practices. According to multiple reports, federal agencies faced "substantial losses" from JPMorgan's actions, which included the approval of thousands of loans that failed to adhere to underwriting guidelines.

We're seeing bullish developments that point to huge gains in the burgeoning uranium market. Here's how to play that surging bull market…##2731|But don't go clicking any links found in the spreadsheet the hackers posted, for There Be Trojans.

Update: Mt Gox has filed for US bankruptcy protection. CEO Karpales says, in the statement accompanying the bankruptcy protection documents, that it would "allow Mt Gox a necessary breathing period for it to focus on its restructuring efforts without the distraction that would result if certain litigation currently pending in the United States were allowed to proceed."

According to Karpales, Mt Gox has $63.9 million in liabilities and approximately $37.7 million in assets. Karpales also claims that the hack which took down Mt Gox stole approximately 7% of the world's Bitcoin supply.

Source: Ars Technica

Original Story:

One of the things that's been puzzling the Bitcoin community is, if the Mt Gox wallet really was emptied by person or persons unknown, where did all the coins go? You'd think a transaction of that size would show up in the public ledger of transactions, runs the theory. Those of you following all things Bitcoin related may remember that other self-appointed investigators followed a very similar theory searching for Sheep Marketplace's Bitcoin, with dismal results. Now some of Mt Gox's customers have hacked the personal blog and Reddit account of Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpales, posting what they claim is evidence of fraud. Or, as they prefer to put it, evidence that they've been Goxed.

The hackers posted messages, since removed from Karpales' blog and Reddit, claiming that they had discovered where Karpales stored the loot. The hackers claim Karpales kept back 951,116 Bitcoin, though this claim may not be all it seems.

For one, as Forbes points out, the spreadsheet posted by the hackers may simply indicate how badly Mt Gox dropped the ball; that all those figures show is what Mt Gox thought it had, not what it actually possessed.

For another, the information posted seems to be infested with Trojans. The posts included genuine Mt Gox data mixed in with a healthy helping of .exe and Mac.app files, some of which are actually Bitcoin stealing viruses disguised as back office tools. Should you go looking for the files yourself, you're advised not to open them.

One poster says that the data was obtained by installing a rootkit months ago on one of Mt Gox's servers via known Gentoo Linux distribution flaws, and the installation was successful because Karpales didn't bother to update. This same poster, nanashi, claimed to have access to much of Mt Gox's customer data in a 20GB stolen database, possibly including bank details, passwords, usernames, even passport scans. Nanashi offered this database for sale for 100 Bitcoin. "Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure," he says.

Source: Forbes##2732|Ben Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist and Treasury adviser, has been appointed as the Bank of England's deputy governor for monetary policy, as the Treasury and the Bank selected a woman to serve on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) for the first time in four years. Mr Broadbent, who joined the MPC as an external member in 2011, will replace Charlie Bean, who retires at the end of June after 14 years at the Bank. In a major shake-up of the MPC, the Treasury and Bank also announced the appointment of Nemat Shafik, who will serve in the newly created role of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking. She joins on August 1 and will replace Paul Fisher on the MPC, who will remain at the Bank. Egyptian-born Ms Shafik - known by her nickname Minouche - has served as a deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since April 2011 - where she oversees work on countries in Europe and the Middle East.

The new post has been created to “conduct a root-and-branch review of how [the Bank] conducts market intelligence,” Mark Carney, the Governor, told MPs last week. Ms Shafik also joins at a difficult time for the Bank, which this month suspended one of its employees amid allegations that the central bank was involved in the rigging of the foreign exchange market .

Ms Shafik said she was "excited to be joining the Bank at such a critical time of institutional change".

Andy Haldane, currently the Bank’s executive director for financial stability, will become chief economist and executive director for monetary analysis - a post currently held by Spencer Dale, and join the MPC.

Mr Dale will move into the role of executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, and leave the MPC to join the Financial Policy Committee, which is responsible for ensuring financial stability. Both appointments will come into effect on June 1.

Economists said the changes added a "degree of raised uncertainty" as to the direction of debate on the MPC.

"In Paul Fisher’s departure the MPC is clearly losing a ‘dove’. But in Dale’s move off the MPC it is also losing a ‘hawk’," said David Tinsley, chief UK economist at BNP Paribas.

"At the same time Nemat Shafik’s views will be an unknown quantity for a while (she may hug the consensus until she feels more up to speed with the UK conjuncture). Andy Haldane has a reputation as a ‘free thinker’. How this translates into his views on monetary policy are not clear."

Anthony Habgood, the chairman of Whitbread, was also named head of the court of the Bank of England, which is responsible for managing the Bank's affairs.

Commenting on the appointments of Ms Shafik, Mr Broadbent and Mr Habgood, George Osborne, the Chancellor, said: “I am delighted to announce the appointment of three such highly qualified and experienced people to join the Bank’s already excellent executive team. Their impressive experience of business, economics and international finance will strengthen and diversify the Bank’s top team and enable them to continue to face Britain’s ongoing economic challenges from a position of strength”.

Ms Shafik is the first woman to serve on the MPC since Kate Barker, who was a member of the committee between 2001 and 2010. She will be the Bank's fourth deputy governor - a record for the Bank - which managed with just one between 1694 and 1998.

Since joining the MPC, Mr Broadbent has voted to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5pc and its stock of asset purchases at £375bn in all of his 33 meetings. He also voted in favour of the Bank's forward guidance policy.

“I am delighted that individuals of the calibre of Ben Broadbent, Minouche Shafik and Anthony Habgood will be joining the Bank’s leadership group," said Mr Carney.

"With a diverse combination of skills and experience, these appointments result in a well-rounded senior management team at the Bank – one that will set the direction for an ambitious agenda of transformation for the institution and enable it to meet the challenges and opportunities it faces in maintaining monetary and financial stability.”

Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said Ms Shafik had a "broad command of policy issues" and "superb leadership and communications skills.

“I have highly valued Minouche’s contribution as part of the senior team and I have greatly appreciated her advice, candour, and loyalty. She is a dear colleague and, I am proud to say, a dear friend as well ... Minouche will be missed," she said.##2733|Shares

, LOS ANGELES, Mar 11 – Marijuana sales in Colorado brought in $3.5 million in tax revenues and fees in the first month retail pot outlets were allowed, the western US state said Monday.

The figure included $2.9 million in taxes for recreational and medical marijuana in the month of January, and nearly $600,000 in fees, said Colorado’s Department of Revenue.

The Rocky Mountain state had legalized pot in 2012, but made drug history on January 1 by inaugurating retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. It levies a 15 percent excise tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax.

“The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations,” said tax department chief Barbara Brohl, while cautioning that the size of the industry might take a few months to become clear.

Initial projections had suggested 40 businesses would be up and running on January 1, but in fact only 24 were by then. By the end of January, 59 businesses had filed tax returns.

After Colorado, Pacific Northwest state Washington is set to follow suit later this year – even though, under federal law, marijuana remains as illegal as heroin, ecstasy and LSD.

In Alaska, campaigners are “very hopeful” of putting legalization to a popular vote in August. Similar efforts in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada and Oregon are under way, though in more preliminary stages.

President Barack Obama’s administration told federal prosecutors last August to stop targeting individual marijuana smokers in states where legalization is in place.

Colorado said that, in the first few months of retail sales, tax and fee revenues will be “significantly affected in both directions” by various factors.

A “possible increase in initial demand” could boost sales at first, while the speed with which pot shops are licensed and how readily they can get supplies, may also have an impact.

“We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts,” said Brohl.##2734|Empty##2735|Why did this happen?

Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world's biggest banana supplier.

The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.

The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.

Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.

The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.

Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66).

Fyffes rose 46 percent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 percent to $12.20 in New York.

Fyffes, pronounced 'Fifes', is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.

David McCann, Fyffes' chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.

Lonergan said their "natural strategic partnership" would "provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice."

However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren't expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate.

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged lower on Monday, on the heels of a record high for the S&P 500, following unexpectedly weak data in China which tempered enthusiasm over the strength of the global economy.

* China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

* The data put a damper on positive sentiment generated by Friday’s better-than-expected U.S. payrolls report, which sent the S&P 500 to a record high for a second consecutive session.

* In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, indicating the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures.

* S&P 500 e-mini futures slipped 2.5 points and were slightly below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures shed 21 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.75 point.

* Boeing Co said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.

* The situation in Ukraine remained unsettled. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday it was outraged by lawlessness in eastern Ukraine, blaming the far-right paramilitary movement Right Sector for “conniving” with the new government in Kiev. Germany’s Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution.

* European shares inched higher following the previous session’s sharp sell-off, although mining shares were weaker as a result of the soft Chinese data.

* Asian stocks fell sharply as the surprisingly weak Chinese trade data rattled investors.##2738|Empty##2739|Empty##2740|Japan-based Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox has been dysfunctional, bankrupt and shrouded with a veil of mystery for weeks. The site's owners said in February 744,408 bitcoins were stolen due to a glitch in the Bitcoin protocol and took the site down, but updates were scarce since then.

Now, unidentified hackers claim they have data, including database dumps, that proves Mt. Gox's owners actually kept the bitcoins for themselves.

According to a report by Forbes, Hackers claim to have stolen the data from Mt. Gox's servers; they also took control of CEO Mark Karpeles' Reddit account and personal blog.

"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," hackers wrote, claiming no user database dumps have been included.

The data comprises of a spreadsheet of more than a million trades on Mt. Gox as well as a 716MB file that appears to show Mt. Gox's balance in 18 currencies, including bitcoin. The file points to a balance of 951,116 bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox, with a note saying "That fat f*ck has been lying." At the current exchange rate on bitcoin exchange BTC-e.com, that amount of bitcoins is worth approximately $595 million.

Early reports on Reddit claim the database file is genuine, but it's hard to confirm anything at this point, especially since many of the related posts on Reddit have been deleted.

Mt.Gox did not directly respond to the incident, but it did put a warning notice over the weekend, claiming that phishing emails impersonating Mt.Gox were being sent to users and warning them not to respond to these emails.##2741|A person plays Candy Crush Saga on his tablet on March 6, 2014 in Lille, northern France

The maker of the addictive mobile game Candy Crush hopes to raise as much as $532.8 million in a New York IPO that would value the company at up to $7.6 billion.

King Digital Entertainment, the British developer behind the hit game, filed new documents on its much-awaited initial public offering that showed plans to sell 22.2 million shares at between $21 and $24 a share.

That would give the company a market capitalization of between $6.6 billion and $7.6 billion.

That is a substantial payoff for a simple game that is rooted in the decades-old Tetris -- sweets and bon bons tumble from the top which the player needs to match in groups to advance.

But the addictive qualities of the Candy Crush Saga, and the company's ability to monetize that by users on computers, tablets and cellphones paying extra to help them advance through its 500 levels, underpin the sky-high valuation.

The company says its games, which also include Farm Heroes and Pet Rescue, are installed on 600 million mobile devices, and played over 1.4 billion times a day -- more than one billion alone for Candy Crush.

That has driven a sharp climb in revenues, from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012 to $602 million in the fourth quarter of last year, the company said in its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Profits in the fourth quarter reached $159 million.

"Our focus is to provide a highly engaging, differentiated entertainment experience where the combination of challenge and progress drives a sense of achievement," King Digital said.

"We believe we have a repeatable and scalable game development process that is unparalleled in our industry."

"A key principle for King is that no individual game session should take more than a few minutes," chief executive Riccardo Zacconi said in the IPO statement.

"We call it bitesize brilliance -- the perfect way to spend three minutes of free time."

The IPO, announced last month, could test the US market's stomach for high valuations of technology stocks after its strong five-year bull run.

Stocks have paused in recent weeks with investors seeking more signs of economic and corporate strength to push them higher; the S&P 500 is up less than 1.0 percent so far this year.

The huge listings of Facebook and Twitter in the past two years have proven successful despite early worries of overpricing.

But Zynga, the company behind the hit online game FarmVille, was valued at $7 billion when it entered the market in December 2011, and has since lost 40 percent of that value.

Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle told AFP he viewed the King IPO price as "very ambitious and risky" and warned it might not hold up after the shares begin trading.

"This is a game company and game companies are only as good as their popular games," he said.

"Folks tend to tire and switch with most game classes, and the casual game class has a ton of competition."

That said, he added, "the market is funding well beyond what I think are reasonable amounts so they actually could get the money."##2742|Talk to a domain expert: 1-303-893-0552

Li's comments come after the country's first-ever default on a domestic corporate bond last week and as investors grow worried that other firms could follow suit.

has attached "very high attention high attention" on government debt and risks in this area are generally within control, Li told his annual press conference at the end of the session.

He also defended the fixing a modest 7.5% target for GDP, saying it is right for strike a balance between growth, job creation and controlling inflation.

Li said reforms in key areas have been been set as a priority on the country's overall reform agenda in 2014.

"The ultimate goal of all the reforms is to fully energize the market," said the adding that the country would "carry out the reforms without hesitation".

Citing an official audit of government debts last year, Li said the country's debt-to- ratio is still below the internationally recognised warning line.

After two months of nationwide audits, the National Audit Office disclosed that governments at various levels were liable for a total direct debt of 20.7 trillion yuan ($3.4 trillion) at the end of June last year, up 8.6 per cent, or 1.63 trillion yuan, since the end of 2012, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

China's mounting government debt is considered as a latent danger to financial stability and has started to take steps to address the issue.

Li said while the debt level is within control but at the same time cautioned that the problem should not be overlooked, promising to take further regulatory steps, including putting the debt under budgetary management, to strengthen oversight.

In China, local governments are not legally allowed to borrow funds on their own.

The fiscal funds they receive from the central government and other sources of revenue, such as taxes, cannot meet their funding needs either, forcing them to use back-door approaches for funding that involves state-owned firms and local government financing vehicles.

"We will keep the front open and block side doors," Li stressed as he held his once-a-year news conference after the close of the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), the Communist Party-controlled legislature.

Li also said that authorities have set a timetable for implementing the Basel III accord in tightening regulative measures over "shadow banking".

Regarding the defaults of financial products, Li said avoiding a few individual cases would be difficult, but efforts must be taken to make sure regional and systemic financial risks do not occur.##2744|The city of Los Angeles will not settle.

However in s statement the cable network company denied the charges that they had not paid the city.

This new comes after the announcement made by Time Warner Inc. that it will be increasing customer rates by about 6% a month for everyone not covered in the promotional package. Time Warner Inc. currently has about 1.5 million customers and the hike in prices will affect about 30% of these people.

U.S. stocks are moving lower in midday trading following disappointing economic news from China and Japan.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell five points, or 0.3 per cent, to 1,872 as of noon Eastern time Monday.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 76 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 16,375. The Nasdaq composite fell 11 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 4,324.

Investors were discouraged by an 18 per cent slump in Chinese exports last month, the latest sign of trouble for the world's second-largest economy. Japan lowered its estimate for fourth-quarter economic growth.

In the U.S., Chiquita Brands jumped 12 per cent after announcing it had agreed to combine with an Irish fruit supply company.

The Labor Department says employers posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 percent from December. That is still below November's nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped 4 million since March 2008.

The job market may be emerging from a winter slump. Employers added 175,000 jobs in February, the government said last week. That was much higher than in December and January, when cold weather lowered job growth.

Total hiring slipped 0.9 percent to 4.5 million in January. That hiring total might sound like a lot, but in a healthy job market, roughly 5 million people are hired each month.

- The Associated Press##2748|Janet Yellen takes center stage in the week ahead, chairing her first FOMC meeting amid market skittishness over events in Ukraine.

There is little doubt the Fed will continue to move forward and announce another $10 billion "taper" of its bond-buying program, taking it to $55 billion a month. The Fed is widely expected to take a knife to some of the language in its statement that set an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent as a level to cut rates.

"This is all about her. It's her first meeting. It just doesn't seem like the meeting where there's going to be a lot of policy fireworks given it might be prudent to let things coast through again, while they all get on the same page," said George Goncalves, Treasury strategist at Nomura Americas.

Related: Raging Bull - Will the Rally Make It to Its Sixth Year?

The Fed's target of 6.5 percent for unemployment is seen by the markets as outdated and confusing, since unemployment is now at 6.7 percent. Fed officials have also called it obsolete. The Fed will also release new economic forecasts, and any talk about the economy is likely to suggest that the weather may be a major factor behind recent weak data.

Goncalves does not expect the Fed to make moves based on Ukraine, unless markets deteriorate rapidly. "The Fed's in a tough predicament because they can't seem like they're reaciting. They demonstrated once before when we had the fallout in January, they were unwaivering. They did the taper," he said.

While stocks sold off in the past week, buyers sought safety in bonds, sending the 10-year yield to 2.65 percent. The Dow was down 2.4 percent to 16,065 and the S&P was off nearly 2 percent to 1,841, in the worst weekly performance since January.

The Fed's success at altering its forward guidance will ultimately show up in the yield curve, Goncalves said.

"The flattening of the curve could be the risk next week. 10s (10-year notes) and 30s (30-year bonds) maybe can go up a little bit in rates, but fives (5-year notes) can go up more if they don't seem like they made more progress on the forward guidance," he said.

The two-day Fed meeting ends Wednesday with a presser by Yellen, also her first.

Markets are expected to remain on edge going into the coming week, after Sunday's referendum in Crimea on whether to join Russia or stay with Ukraine. Tense talks between the U.S. and Russia ended Friday with no clear resolution on whether Russia would recognize the vote and the West would impose sanctions. "I think anxieties are going to be running high. The Crimea vote is a foregone conclusion, but how does the West respond? How does Russia respond?" said Marc Chandler, chief Treasury strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.

Herbalife said Wednesday it is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.

“Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,” the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."

Shares in the company fell by as much as 17.5 percent during the day on Wednesday. The stock closed at $60.57 a share, down about 7 percent.

The stock will continue to be depressed during the course of Herbalife’s investigation, said Kerry Fields, a professor of business law and ethics at USC’s Marshall School of Business. He said he doesn’t think Herbalife’s revenues would be impacted by the investigation because a good portion of its sales is in developing countries.

“Their revenue might not be affected, by their overall corporate image will take a hit over the next six months while the investigation proceeds in earnest,” Fields told KPCC.

Herbalife made the announcement just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company. Ackman repeatedly has bet against the company and says he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme.

BoE Governor Mark Carney is due to give a speech at 1805 GMT on Tuesday announcing wide-ranging changes to the Bank’s organisation, including details of a separate new post of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking.

“The Treasury is likely to announce the new deputy governor for monetary policy before Mr Carney’s speech,” the source said.

Britain’s finance ministry has advertised for a successor to Bean, who retires on June 30.

The BoE’s chief economist, Spencer Dale, is the favourite to succeed Bean, according to bookmakers Paddy Power, although other recent senior appointments – including that of Carney himself – have not gone to BoE insiders.

Carney is also keen to have more women in senior positions at the BoE. None currently serve on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee that sets interest rates.

Mike Feuer is claiming that the region's largest pay TV provider "stiffed" the city out of roughly $10 billion during the financial crisis after late 2008.

While the cable company was profiting from billions of dollars off of its Los Angeles customers, the city was struggling through extremely tough economic woes.

"This is a day where we are saying enough is enough," Feuer said at a City Hall news conference.

According to the 24-page lawsuit, Time Warner Cable "has blatantly refused to live up to its obligations to the city," while it has collected "more than $1 billion in revenue every two years from residents of Los Angeles."

The cable company, which is already the sole carrier to the Los Angeles Lakers broadcasting rights in the region, will capitalize on another one of the city's beloved sports teams -- the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Time Warner Cable is charging its TV subscribers $4 per month for the newly launched Dodgers channel, even if those customers don't watch the Dodgers. The $50 annual charge has created tensions between the cable company and others such as DirecTV, Dish Network, Charter Communications, Cox Communications and more over the carriage rights to the new channel.

Feuer said the lawsuit has no regards to the cable companies disputes but rather Time Warner owes the city $2.5 million in franchise fees and public, education and governmental channel fees from 2008 and 2009 as well as $7.2 million in fees from 2010 and 2011.

"Time Warner pocketed the money from its subscribers and did not turn it over the city of Los Angeles," Feuers said.

Feuer also said the money that is owed could have gone to hiring 100 police officers.

Time Warner Cable denied the allegations in a written statement.

"As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the City of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen in the City of Los Angeles.

“I would do something differently from the president,” Paul said. “I would immediately get every obstacle out of the way for our export of oil and gas, and I would begin drilling in every possible conceivable place within our territories in order to have production we can supply Europe with if it’s interrupted from Ukraine.”

Paul joins the growing contingent of Republicans using the crisis as an excuse to push an agenda of increased oil and gas production, including House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who declared last Wednesday that the best way to “support the Ukrainian people and confront Russian aggression" is to speed up the approval of natural gas exports from U.S. fracking operations.

The New York Times editorial board conceded in an Op-Ed that "increasing natural gas exports could serve American foreign-policy interests in Europe, which gets about 30 percent of its gas from Russia." However, the Times was quick to caution, "even if the government approved more exports, setting up more facilities to liquefy and ship gas would take years and cost billions of dollars," while Putin "would not stand idly by."

Dublin-based fruit supplier Fyffes is to merge with US-based rival Chiquita in a deal creating the world's largest banana company.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of $4.6bn (€3.31bn) from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of $3bn and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the North Carolina-based company will own 50.7pc of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at $526m.

The existing brands will be retained but customers will have access to a more diverse product mix and choice, the two companies said.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the merged business, said: "Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

"We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers."

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world's oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland.

Conforming 5/1 Hybrid ARM rates also increased by six basis points, closing the Wednesday-to-Tuesday wraparound weekly survey at an average of 3.14 percent.

"With the latest employment report stronger than expected, and with upward revisions to the last two months, the economy seems to have gotten through the rough winter," said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com. "There has been plenty of downbeat data over the last month or so keeping interest rates down, but the latest evidence suggests that we’ll see a stronger economy as the winter fades."

Wicked winter weather has been blamed for everything from weak retail sales to sagging housing markets. To the extent that is actually the case, we should begin to see a quickening in the pace of economic growth, but it may be a while before that is fully reflected in emerging data.

"The first quarter of 2014 seems likely to feature sub-par growth, with Gross Domestic Product in the mid-two percent range," adds Gumbinger. "If growth begins to rise, so may mortgage rates, but the early part of the spring home buying season will most likely get underway with some favorable mortgage rate conditions."

Investing.com - Gold prices edged higher on Tuesday as the ongoing Russian standoff in Ukraine bolstered the yellow metal's appeal as a hedge.On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,348.00 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 0.48%, up from a session low of $1,338.00 and off a high of $1,352.80.

The April contract settled up 0.25% at $1,341.50 on Monday.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,328.20 a troy ounce, Monday's low, and resistance at $1,355.00, the high from March 3.

Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge on Tuesday.

Russia remained at odds with the West on how to end the standoff in Ukraine, while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declined an invitation to visit Russia for further discussions, which boosted gold prices.

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery was down 0.26% at US$20.855 a troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were down 2.60% at US$2.983 a pound.

Weak Chinese trade data bruised copper prices.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The numbers confirmed market concerns that emerging markets are cooling, especially China, which consumes about 40% of the world's copper supply.##2761|Empty##2762|A note from Nomura Group warns that the economy has hit a soft patch in the first quarter of 2014, but that shouldn’t lessen the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tapering its monthly bond and Treasury purchases.

“The stable fiscal outlook should be supportive for growth over the course of the year,” the report states. “Business investment will likely pick up gradually in 2014 as the outlook improves.”

Fed Chair Janet Yellen said as much to the Senate Banking Committee in late February. Yellen said that although the official unemployment rate has been declining, largely due to people dropping out of the workforce rather than by job creation, it shouldn’t be the sole measure for Fed guidance.

Noumra likewise says the Fed will move from a focus on unemployment to a broader perspective.

“Forward guidance will increasingly focus on inflation as an indication of future short-term interest rate increases,” Nomura tells clients. “Tighter financial conditions, ongoing policy uncertainty, and the pace of global growth remain the key risks.”##2763|A Chinese technology company has been using satellites to explore a claim that the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 crashed in a Cambodian jungle.

Ian Wilson, a digital video producer from the UK, believes he has spotted the plane on Google Maps.

The aircraft vanished four years ago, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with 239 people on board in what has become one of the greatest aviation mysteries in history.

Wilson says the Google Maps object, which lies around 60 miles west of Phnom Penh, is close in size to the Boeing 777-200.

“I just thought I’d have a wander through. I work in digital video so I’m on Google Earth all the time,” he said.

“So I was on there - a few hours here, a few hours there. If you added it up I spent hours searching for places a plane could have gone down.”

Experts from Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co Ltd assembled ten satellites to zoom in on the high-altitude jungle but have found no sign of the plane.

Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Chinese newspaper Global Times that it would “take a professional search team on the ground to lay the claim to rest”.

Wilson hopes to visit the area himself.

However, the Aviation Safety Network suggests his find could just be a jet in the air caught by a Google Maps satellite.

Meanwhile, Sin Chansereyvutha, spokesman for Cambodia's State Secretariat of Civil Aviation, told Xinhua news agency: “First, there is not any evidence - information or data - to prove that it crashed in Cambodia.

“Second, if this news was true, the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia would make a hotline call to us for cooperation, because in ASEAN we have a memorandum of understanding on cooperation and information sharing on search and rescue when there is a plane crash.

“But the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia has not contacted us on this issue, so we conclude that this is false news.”

Others have pointed out that Cambodia is 4,000 miles away from Reunion Island, where debris from the plane washed up, suggesting it went down in the Indian Ocean after all.

MH370 report: did ‘third party’ hackers down missing plane?

30 July 2018

Missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was deliberately flown out into the Indian Ocean before disappearing – although why and by whom remains a mystery, a long-awaited report from the Malaysian government has concluded.

Speaking at a press conference in Putrajaya, Malaysia, on Monday, the government’s chief investigator Kok Soo Chon said: “We can conclude that MH370 had turned back and the turn back was not because of anomalies in the mechanical system. The turn back was made not under autopilot but under manual control.”

He was quick to dismiss two of the most popular conspiracy theories surrounding the plane’s disappearance, saying “we are not of the opinion it could have been an event committed by the pilots”, whilst also appearing to disprove accusations of mechanical failure.

He did, however, add that while the 600-page report did not contain any evidence to suggest that the plane was taken over remotely by hackers or terrorists, “we cannot exclude the possibility that there was unlawful interference by a third party.”

Speaking to The Australian, renowned Canadian air crash investigator Larry Vance said that, if a third party was found to be behind the crash, “the final sentence of this report should be a recommendation that a full criminal investigation be conducted to identify the perpetrator(s) and examine the potential motivation(s)”.

Flight MH370 vanished with 239 people on board en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014.

Its disappearance sparked one of the biggest search missions in history, but four years and hundreds of millions of dollars later it remains one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries, sparking countless conspiracy theories about its fate.

Today’s long-awaited findings – initially described as the “final report”, although investigators then backtracked from that description – “left the hopes of the families dashed after it failed to provide any concrete conclusions about the reasons the plane disappeared nor any indication where the wreckage might be”, says The Guardian.

It reiterates Malaysia’s assertion that the plane was deliberately diverted and flown for more than seven hours after severing communications. The Daily Mail reports that relatives who were briefed at the Transport Ministry before the report’s public release “expressed anger that there was nothing new in the document, with some storming out of the briefing as frustration boiled over”.

Despite parts of the wreckage being discovered as far north as the eastern coast of Tanzania and as far south as the eastern coast of South Africa, Chon told reporters: “The team is unable to determine the real cause for disappearance. The answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found.”

He appeared to hand responsibility for the final answer to the mystery of MH370 over to the Australian government, which led the search and rescue operations. “As far as our team is concerned, we have done our job... We do not deal with search. Search is not our area. You have to ask the people responsible for the search. I can only answer your question relating to the investigation,” he said.

Last month, a private “no find, no fee” search was finally called off after US-seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity failed to find any sign of the plane in a 125,000sq/km area identified as its most likely resting place by experts.

Malaysia’s new government, which took power in May, has said the hunt could be resumed but only if new evidence comes to light. Officials seem keen to draw a line under the tragedy.

Will MH370’s disappearance forever remain a mystery?

29 May

The fate of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 looks set to remain a mystery, after the four-year multi-million dollar search finally came to an end today with the plane's whereabouts still unknown.

In March 2014, 239 people on board the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing vanished in what has become the greatest mystery in aviation history.

The disappearance sparked one of the biggest and most expensive search operations of all time as well as countless conspiracy theories.

A three-year $151m (£115m) search by Malaysian, Australian and Chinese investigators was called off in January 2017 after failing to find any sign of the plane or debris over a 120,000 square-mile area in the Indian Ocean, thought to be the most likely final resting place of MH370.

Then in January this year, under pressure from relatives, the Malaysian government signed a $70m (£52m) 90-day ‘no find, no fee’ deal with US private seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity to explore a 9,650 square-mile zone north of the original search area.

At the time Malaysian officials said there was an 85% chance of success, but as the search has gone on with still no sign of the plane, expectation has slowly turned to disappointment.

Ocean Infinity’s primary vessel, Seabed Explorer, found nothing in the initial search area and has since extended its activities to cover over 33,300 square miles of seabed in the southern Indian Ocean.

But with worsening weather making any continued search impossible, Ocean Infinity’s gamble has failed to pay off, leaving the families of those on board searching for answers about what happened.

Danica Weeks, an Australian who lost her husband on the flight, called on her country's foreign minister Julie Bishop to urge Malaysia's new government to be more transparent about what it knows of the disappearance.

Voice 370, a lobby group made up of MH370 families, have called on the Malaysian government to release the plane’s full cargo manifest, arguing that the flight was carrying more than two tonnes worth of cargo which has never been fully identified.

The New Zealand Herald says the mystery cargo “was the focus of early conspiracy theories relating to MH370's disappearance thanks to a decision by Malaysian authorities not to immediately disclose that the plane had a been carrying a large quantity of potentially flammable lithium batteries”.

Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke says a full report into the plane’s disappearance will be published in the future but has so far not given a date.

Australian, Malaysian and Chinese authorities have all agreed that an official search would not resume unless credible evidence emerged on the plane’s location.

However, in one ray of light for relatives, Anwar Ibrahim, who is widely tipped to become Malaysia's prime minister, told The Australian newspaper there was “further digging” to be done.

In the long-term, “a project to map the ocean floor may also offer answers”, says the BBC.

Until then though, it appears the plane’s disappearance will remain a mystery and continue to be a favourite topic for conspiracists for years to come.##2764|Empty##2765|Euro zone consumer inflation returned to its lowest ever annual pace in February, revised data showed on Monday, slowing down to the same rate that triggered a surprise interest rate cut by the European Central Bank in November.

The year-on-year inflation rate in the 18 countries sharing the euro slowed to 0.7 percent in February from 0.8 percent in January, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said.

This is a revision from the initial Eurostat estimate that inflation was 0.8 percent in February, which was also the basis for market consensus expectations.

Year-on-year price growth slowed to 0.7 percent, the lowest annual inflation reading since the creation of the euro in 1999, for the first time last October, which made the ECB cut its key interest rate to new record low of 0.25 percent in November.

Month-on-month inflation was 0.3 percent in February, driven by a 0.5 percent rise in prices of services and a 0.4 percent increase in costs of non-energy industrial goods.

Prices of food, alcohol and tobacco fell 0.1 percent on the month, while the highly volatile costs of energy inched up 0.1 percent.

ECB President Mario Draghi said last Thursday the bank has been preparing additional policy steps to guard against the possibility of deflation in the euro zone as the strong euro weighed on prices.

Draghi saw risks of deflation as «quite limited», but added that the longer inflation remained low, the higher the probability of deflationary risks emerging.

In February, there were four euro zone countries with negative annual inflation rates, Portugal and Slovakia both with -0.1 percent, Greece with -0.9 percent and Cyprus saw annual inflation rate at -1.3 percent.

The ECB, despite forecasting low inflation for years to come, left interest rates on hold this month.

Draghi rejected comparisons with Japan's experience of deflation which became so entrenched that companies and households held off on spending on expectations of lower prices ahead, leading to two decades of economic stagnation.

[Reuters]##2766|Vodafone has agreed to acquire Spain’s ONO for the equivalent of €7.2 billion (US$10 billion), following last week’s meeting of the cable operator’s shareholders to weigh the relative attractions of the UK mobile operator’s offer and a public flotation.

Vodafone said it expects to achieve €2 billion in cost and capital expenditure synergies from the acquisition within four years of completion. The deal values ONO at 7.5 times its 2013 EBITDA and 10.4 times operating free cash flow adjusted for cost saving synergies.

Vodafone said it expected to achieve revenue synergies to the tune of €1 billion through the development of unified products and services as well as by cross-selling of existing product lines.

ONO’s network passes 7.2 million homes and the company has about 1.9 million customers.

Vodafone will now refocus its own fibre-to-the-home build out on areas not covered by the ONO network, with a plan to pass 1.5 million homes. The combination of its own and ONO’s network will pass 10 million homes, or 57% of the country’s total.

Vodafone expects the deal to close in the third quarter, pending regulatory and other approvals.

“The combination of Vodafone and ONO creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone,” said Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colão.

“Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market. We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain.”##2767|Sorry for inconvenience!

The repository made headlines last month after £200 million worth of Bitcoins were allegedly stolen by hackers, forcing the organisation to file for bankruptcy protection in Japan and close its doors.

The company claimed in the bankruptcy filing that it had lost 750,000 customer Bitcoins, as well as 100,000 company-owned ones too.

However, a separate group of hackers have now accused the firm of pocketing at least some of the money it told users had been stolen.

According to a report by Forbes, the hackers gained access to the Reddit account and personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles to post a missive detailing their accusations.

“It’s time that MTGOX got the Bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote.

The term “Goxed” is often used by Mt. Gox users to describe instances where the site has gone offline or experienced other technical issues.

The group also reportedly posted a 716 megabyte file to Karpeles’ personal website that allegedly contained data stolen from Mt. Gox’s servers about the organisation’s finances.

The hackers said it shows the company has a balance of 951,116 Bitcoins, and have used it to pour scorn on Mt. Gox’s assertion that users’ money had been lost.

Karpeles was unresponsive to requests for comment from Forbes, and – at the time of writing – the hackers’ claims were still awaiting verification.

In the meantime, industry watchers have started questioning why no evidence has been uncovered to date about how the stolen Bitcoins are being spent, fuelling speculation they may not have been stolen at all.##2769|Empty##2770|ALB M&A Rankings 2018During the first half of 2018, there were 6,484 disclosed M&A deals with Asian involvement amounting to $540.4 billion, representing an increase of 23.5 percent compared to the first half of 2017, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

TOKYO, March 18 — Japan’s government says it has yet to decide whether to regulate Bitcoin, while highlighting that banks must report any suspicions of money laundering stemming from trades of the digital currency.

The government is still collecting information on Bitcoin, it said today in a written response to questions asked by opposition lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo. Banks had a duty to notify authorities if they suspected that customers had been involved in crime or drug dealing, it said.

The bankruptcy last month of Mt. Gox Co., an online Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, brought the issue of regulating the virtual currency into focus in Japan. Bitcoin has attracted attention from authorities around the world who are concerned that the anonymity of transactions may attract money launderers.

Okubo’s questions centred on the responsibilities of Japanese banks used by Bitcoin exchanges to settle transactions with clients. While Bitcoin is not considered a currency in Japan, it could be subject to taxation, as with goods and services, the government said on March 7 in response to earlier questions from Okubo, who is a member of the Democratic Party of Japan.

Mt. Gox was a customer of Mizuho Bank Ltd., a unit of Japan’s third-biggest bank by market value. Tokyo-based Mizuho repeatedly asked Mt. Gox to close its accounts in the months before the exchange’s collapse because it was concerned about an unmanageable volume of money transfers, The Wall Street Journal reported this month.

Banks in Japan were required to check the identity of people who wanted to send more than ¥100,000 (RM3,230) of cash, along with the purpose of transfers, and keep records of the transactions, the government said in today’s statement.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore said last week that it planned to regulate virtual-currency intermediaries including operators of Bitcoin exchanges and vending machines to deal with risks of potential money laundering and terrorist financing. — Bloomberg##2772|This will appear next to all of your comments

This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser##2773|China’s economy slowed markedly in the first two months of the year, with growth in investment, retail sales and factory output all falling to multi-year lows, a surprisingly weak performance that raises the spectre of a sharper cooldown.

The weaker-than-expected data is bound to amplify global investors’ worries about slackening growth in the world’s second-largest economy, and will almost certainly feed speculation that Beijing may loosen policies soon to bolster growth.

China’s industrial output rose 8.6 per cent in the first two months of 2014 from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said today, missing market expectations for a 9.5 per cent rise.

That marked the worst performance for China’s factory output growth since April 2009. “Policy easing should be imminent,” said Hao Zhou, an economist at ANZ Bank in Shanghai, adding that Thursday’s data implied that China’s economy may grow 7 per cent in the first quarter.

Sources earlier this week suggested that China’s central bank is prepared to take its strongest action since 2012 to loosen monetary policy if economic growth slows further, by cutting the amount of cash that banks must keep as reserves.

A cut would be triggered if growth slips below 7.5 per cent and towards 7.0 per cent, and would be expected only in the second quarter, according to the sources who are involved in internal policy discussions.

Other sectors of the economy also appeared to have lost steam. Growth in retail sales was the slowest in three years, up 11.8 per cent in January and February compared to the year-ago period. Analysts had expected a rise of 13.5 per cent. Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, fared even worse. It was up 17.9 per cent in the first two months from the same period last year, a level unseen in 11 years and some way below forecasts for a 19.4 percent increase.

Asian stock markets and most regional currencies such as the Australian dollar and China’s offshore yuan pared early gains after the data was released.

The statistics bureau released combined data for January and February in a bid to reduce distortions seen in single-month data caused by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays, when factories, offices and shops often close for long periods.

Trade data last week showed January-February exports fell 1.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier, and tumbled 18.1 per cent in February alone, alarming financial markets.

Many analysts believe Beijing will not consider further easing until more months of data are available. But even accounting for holiday-related shutdowns and distortions, the broader weaker trend so far in 2014 appears clear.

China’s government, which wrapped up its annual parliament meeting today, had said last week that it aims to grow the economy by 7.5 per cent this year. But with growth appearing to drop faster and sharper than what many have expected, some economists believe that China may actually miss its growth target this year for the first time in years.

Reuters##2774|The Federal Trade Commission has opened a formal investigation into Herbalife's operations Wednesday, pushing shares of the nutrition and weight loss company sharply lower.

Shares of Herbalife plunged as much as 15 percent after being temporarily halted but gradually recovered from lows, ending the day down 7.3 percent. Shares were up more than 4 percent prior to the halt. A circuit breaker also briefly halted trading in shares of rival Nu Skin due to volatility.

A source familiar with the probe told CNBC that Herbalife was surprised by the investigation but thought it was the best way to combat allegations about the company's business model.

The probe is expected to last a year or more.

Herbalife said it will fully cooperate with the FTC, saying it "welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace."

On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman accused Herbalife of breaking direct-selling laws in China, its fastest-growing market.

Ackman and Pershing Square also declined to comment. FTC acknowledged the investigation, but did not provide further comment to CNBC.

In December 2012, Ackman raised allegations that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme and made a bet the stock would fall. Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square, has a $1.16 billion short bet on Herbalife, and has been short the stock since the middle of 2012.

Meanwhile, investors reacted in the options market following the FTC inquiry announcement.

"The level of implied volatility surged from 50 percent to 99 percent with the downside range expanding from $50 by next week's expiration down to $30," wrote Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers. "Ahead of the halt only 25,000 contracts had traded on Herbalife and within 15-minutes the tally had risen to 57,000."

The reform, announced on Saturday, means that the limits within which the yuan is allowed to trade against the US dollar have been doubled to as much as 2 per cent above or below the daily fix as of Monday.

In reality however, the yuan has been a largely one-way bet attracting enormous capital from investors. It has appreciated almost uninterrupted against the greenback for at least the past seven years until the PBOC intervened in foreign exchange markets last month to intentionally devalue the currency. That exercise was designed to introduce some volatility into the market as a precursor to the widening of the trading band and served as a warning to speculators.

National Australia Bank's global co-head of foreign exchange strategy, Ray Attrill, said that investors trading offshore yuan for the currency appreciation and also higher yield on offer could no longer count on it being as concrete a bet. "It's going to be a more treacherous playground for people playing the carry trade," he said. "They can be much less confident those gains are assured."

Even so, NAB still takes a bullish view on the yuan in the medium-term.##2777|Close

King Digital Entertainment is looking to cash in big time - to the tune of a $7.6 billion valuation with its upcoming initial public offering.

The maker of the insanely popular Candy Crush Saga mobile game expects to sell 22.2 million shares at between $21 and $24 each. King Digital expects proceeds from the sale in the $612 million range, up from the forecast $500 million made when the company filed with the Security and Exchange Commission in February for an IPO. The company will sell 15.5 million shares while the remaining 6.7 million will be handled by other firms.

The company, which was founded in 2003, claims that in February 144 million active users logged on to play one of its games daily for a total of 1.4 billion game plays per day. This is up from 128 million daily active users playing 1.2 billion games in December.

The number of players is not the only aspect of the company that is growing. King noted in its prospectus that one of the risk factors involved is the explosive growth of the company itself. Since December of 2011 it has added 521 employees and that number is expected to continue climbing.

"We have experienced a period of significant rapid growth and expansion in our operations that has placed, and continues to place, significant strain on our management and resources. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively," the company said.

King's executives also noted that it relies on a small number of games for the vast majority of its success.

"In the fourth quarter of 2013, our top three games Candy Crush Saga, Pet Rescue Saga and Farm Heroes Saga accounted for 95% of our total gross bookings," it noted.

Breaking that down, Candy Crush Saga accounted for 78 percent of its gross bookings during the last three months of 2013. In February alone Candy Crush had 97 million daily players.

As would be expected, potential investors have to realize that if the gross bookings for its small retinue of games falters or the company cannot expand its game portfolio than the company will not meet its financial projections.

The bank has been added to a lawsuit against Mt Gox, since by providing services to the former Magic-the-Gathering card trading operation, the complainants say, it “aided in a fraud”.

The lawsuit was brought by Illinois resident Gregory Greene, as El Reg reported early this month, on the basis that the organisation “intentionally and knowingly failed to provide its users with the level of security protection for which they paid”.

Greene's complaint against Mizuho Bank is that it held “non-Bitcoin” currency – that is, government nominated currencies like dollars and yen – on behalf of Mt Gox. He accuses Mizuho of being aware of fraud, of not protecting customer funds by segregating them from Mt Gox's own holdings, and for making Mt Gox's customers' losses worse by continuing to provide services when the exchange was in trouble.

The key reason for adding the bank to the lawsuit is that Mt Gox is currently under bankruptcy protection in the US.

Greene isn't the only one to slip the bank into the cross-hairs: according to CBC News, Mizuho, along with Mt Gox, is a defendant in an action filed in Ontario on Friday March 14.

The Financial Post says the Canadian filing seeks to launch a $US500 million lawsuit against Mt Gox, its owners Mark Karpeles and Jed McCaleb, along with Mizuho Bank. ®

Sponsored: Following Bottomline’s journey to the Hybrid Cloud##2779|Nook in Bangsar, the first and only physical merchant in Malaysia that accepts Bitcoin in return for its services. — Pictures by Choo Choy May

KUALA LUMPUR, March 18 — When Nook, a co-working space in Bangsar, decided to accept the digital currency Bitcoin for payment, its owner Daniel Yap was not expecting the attention it would generate — from Bitcoin enthusiasts or the media.

Nook was the first and remains the only physical merchant in Malaysia that accepts Bitcoin in return for its services, and Yap admitted he initially picked it up as a “social experiment”.

Bitcoins are a “cryptocurrency”, where cryptography — encryption involving mathematics — is used to control the creation and transfer of the digital money.

Any transaction using Bitcoins is recorded on a shared public database called “block chain” rather than with the exchange of notes or tokens.

That means a customer can transfer a specified amount of Bitcoins from his digital wallet to the vendor’s wallet without anything changing hands physically.

Instead, the vendor only needs to provide his wallet’s address — a 27- to 34-digit alphanumerical string — for the customer to initiate the transfer, usually done in Bitcoin applications, which are available for smartphones or personal computers.

But the world of the Bitcoin has run into trouble.

A Tokyo-based exchange for the digital currency, Mt Gox — an acronym for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange — shut down last month, causing a big drop in the currency’s value and leading to wider worries about the future of the currency.

Unsurprisingly, that has led to a mood of caution.

“The atmosphere in the past few weeks has been dramatic. We see slower trades,” said Colbert Low, who founded BitcoinMalaysia.com, a local Bitcoin exchange.

Enthusiasts are waiting for the price to stabilise, the next generation of mining hardware, and for new exchanges to open up. There were many projects coming soon to Malaysian shores, Low said.

“Our group is enthusiastic despite the setbacks, but not sure about the general public,” he said.

Nook owner Yap: No different from any barter service.

Yap, who owns Nook, told The Malay Mail Online that he started accepting Bitcoin in November last year as he was fascinated by how humans put monetary value on lines of computer codes.

“We get a lot of programmers, freelancers here, and we’ve been talking about Bitcoin for a long time. Of course at that time it was just in my mind, but I’ve always thought it was interesting,” said the former advertising boss.

“If people are willing to barter services, then isn’t it the same thing as bartering Bitcoins?”

Bobby Ong, who runs an online newsletter on digital currency called Altcoin Weekly, said the technology behind Bitcoin solved a number of problems plaguing fiat currency and credit card transactions.

Ong said records on the block chain prevented “double-spending”. This describes a phenomenon where a digital token can be duplicated and spent more than once.

Online newsletter publisher Ong: Virtues in Bitcoin, including preventing fraud.

Bitcoin can also prevent fraud, as merchants are able to confirm almost instantaneously that a payment has been made, before shipping goods to their customers, the self-taught programmer said.

There is a gap of 10 minutes between payment and receipt of Bitcoin, during which time the transaction is processed and confirmed using mathematical proof, a process called “mining”.

The security and anonymity offered by Bitcoin has in turn attracted more vendors in Malaysia to accept Bitcoin as a mode of payment.

A customer can transfer a specified amount of bitcoins from his digital wallet to the vendor’s wallet without any physical exchange.

Bitcoin (with a capital “B”) also refers to an open source peer-to-peer system regulating the virtual currency allegedly released by pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, and became operational in 2009.

One of the earliest vendors was Kuching-based BolehVPN, which offers Virtual Private Network (VPN) services, allowing Internet users worldwide to browse anonymously and securely.

The instant receipt of money also gave Bitcoin the most traction with online shops, including online marketplace Ked.ai, which started accepting the digital currency in early January.

Crypto Snacks, based in Cyberjaya, meanwhile, offers to deliver snacks in exchange for Bitcoins: one chicken mayo sandwich costs 0.001 BTC.

Unlike normal currencies, the value of one unit of Bitcoin — 1 BTC — has no intrinsic value, since it is not backed by any physical assets, or guaranteed by a sovereign government or central bank.

Instead, its value depends solely on its acceptance as a currency, and the public’s confidence in Bitcoin.

The volatility in Bitcoin trade led Bank Negara Malaysia to announce in January that it was not legal tender.

It is believed that the first real-world transaction involving Bitcoin was in May 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, in the US, offered a volunteer from England some Bitcoins in return for ordering two pizzas for him.

Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for the pizzas, making 1 BTC worth around US$0.0025 at that time.

Since then, the value of BTC reached its all-time high of US$1,250 (RM4,108) in November 2013, before falling to US$421 (RM1,383) after China banned the currency the month after.

The rise was due to the financial unrest in Europe, including the financial crisis in Cyprus, which started in 2012, causing users to buy up high amounts of Bitcoins.

At the time of writing, 1 BTC is worth US$621 (RM2,031), according to currency converter site XE.com. Apple banned Bitcoin applications from its devices in early February, a move that dented the virtual currency.

The currency’s extreme volatility led Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) to announce in January that it was not legal tender in the country.

BNM issued the statement in the wake of warnings by several other central banks worldwide, but stopped short of banning the currency.##2780|Singapore: Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in 4-1/2 months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal`s safe-haven appeal.

Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at USD 1,355 an ounce, traders said.

Other precious metals were higher too, with silver climbing over 1 percent.

"There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals," said one Hong Kong-based precious metals.

"It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well," he said.

"With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold`s downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets."

Spot gold had gained 0.6 percent to USD 1,357.11 an ounce by 0309 GMT, after earlier hitting USD 1,359.25 - its highest since October 29. The metal gained 0.8 percent on Tuesday.

Bullion has gained 13 percent this year following a 28 percent drop in 2013, on escalating uncertainties around the world.

Ukraine`s government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise rule from Moscow within days.

China`s first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world`s second-biggest economy. Copper and iron ore prices have been hit the hardest.

In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of USD 500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock.

PHYSICAL MARKETS

Demand for physical bullion and jewellery has dropped off due to the jump in prices.

In China, the world`s biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about USD 3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of USD 20.

Pakistan has extended its ban on gold imports to March 31, as it tries to stop smuggling to India where high import duties have made supplies scarce.##2781|Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) and Chinese Premier Li Keqiand arrive for the closing ceremony of the annual National People's Congress in Beijing on Thursday.

China's Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday during his annual interaction with the media that his government wanted to build a “favourable” neighbouring environment and narrow differences with neighbours, amid recently flaring territorial disputes.

Mr. Li said China had an “unshakeable will” in safeguarding its territory and sovereignty, but at the same time also had “an unwavering commitment” to ensuring a peaceful periphery.

“As a developing country, China needs a favorable neighbouring and international environment for its modernisation,” he said. “When neighbours interact with each other, it is only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of some kind or another. As long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefits, there will be harmonious sound instead of jarring noises.”

He cited the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence or Panchsheel — an idea jointly put forward by India and China — as defining China's neighbourhood diplomacy. His comments come amid rising concerns among many of China's neighbours about its assertiveness over several territorial disputes. China is currently involved in boundary disputes with India; with Japan over disputed East China Sea islands and with a number of countries over the South China Sea.

Over the past year, tensions with Japan have risen over disputed islands and over questions of wartime history, with ties between the two countries simmering in recent months.

China has, however, sought to tone down disputes over the South China Sea and with India. Mr. Li visited India last year — his first overseas visit since taking office — and hosted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in October, when both sides signed a border defence cooperation agreement to formalise and expand confidence building measures.

While neither India nor Japan found mention in Mr. Li's remarks, the Premier instead highlighted China's warming ties with Vietnam — one among many claimants in the South China Sea dispute — as reflected in a joint maritime cooperation agreement signed during his visit to the country last year.

At his annual interaction with domestic and foreign journalists — a carefully choreographed affair where the questions are pre-screened by the Chinese Foreign Ministry — the Premier fielded several questions on economic issues, as well as on ties with the U.S., Europe, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

He also pledged to ramp up the battle against official graft, saying the government would show “zero tolerance” to the corrupt. “No matter how senior an official is, if he violates party discipline and the law of the country he will be seriously dealt with and punished,” he said.

Rising pollution

On the environment, he said the government would take steps to tackle rising pollution, with increasing public anger at the worsening smog enveloping many of China's cities.

He acknowledged that air pollution had become a “major issue for people's lives”. “For many people, the first thing to do [in the morning] is to check the PM 2.5 figure,” he said, referring to particulate matter pollution readings.

In a government work report issued last week outlining policies for the coming year, Mr. Li promised to “declare war on smog”. He said Thursday this did not mean “a war against nature”, but a “war against our own efficient and unsustainable model of growth and way of life”.

GDP growth

He reiterated confidence in the Chinese economy and indicated it would achieve the target of “about 7.5 per cent” growth, but added the government was “not preoccupied with GDP growth”. “The growth that we want,” he said, “is one that brings real benefits to the people, raises quality and efficiency of development, and contributes to energy conservation and environmental protection”##2782|For proper use of this site, you need to enable javascript in your browser!##2783|(Read more: Bull market may still have some sizzle)



The FTSEurofirst300, an index which ranks the 300 largest companies in Europe by market capitalization, has almost doubled over the same period, closing at 1326.7 at the end of last week. This happened despite the euro zone debt crisis and the bailout of weaker euro zone states like Greece and Ireland threatening the region's stability.

Greek equities are one of only two major asset classes (the other is the U.S. dollar) to fall over the period, and are down 30 percent – but this followed a huge credit crisis which some worried would force the country to leave the euro.

The bull market shows how faith in the will of the European Central Bank and European governments to keep the euro afloat has been restored. Confidence in European equities has returned.

The recent unrest in Ukraine, which some feared could be the kind of black swan event that derails markets, caused a minor dip in European stock markets which has since recovered.

A prolonged military conflict or sanctions may disrupt the region's gas supply from Russia.

Persistent slow growth in the region's biggest economies is potentially more damaging.

"Earnings and economic growth have been (and we believe will continue to be) lackluster, and without growth or central bank liquidity, we see no generic reason to be bullish of European equities," Stewart Richardson, chief investment officer at RMG Wealth Management, warned.

There is a risk of excess liquidity causing "excess valuations in a narrow range of assets" – or asset bubbles like the dotcom bubble of the early years of the twenty-first century, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists. So, roughly, if the flight out of emerging markets continues, then the price of assets like London real estate or peripheral euro zone bonds could reach unrealistic heights.

"There are eerie similarities with the 1998-99 period," the BoAML strategists warned.

There are also concerns over European equities' exposure to emerging markets, which account for around 25 percent of European corporate revenues according to UBS research. Panic over the emerging markets has distilled slightly since last year's major sell-off, but is still in the backdrop of market movements.

The FirstLook subscription service works to compate pre- and post-event satellite imagery for emergency management functions, the company said Monday.

Two DigitalGlobe satellites have collected images of the search area, which includes the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea.

No Goose. But he’s still dangerous in the upcoming American Made. Based on the exploits of Barry Seal, it tells the story of pilot hired by the CIA and DEA into one of the largest covert operations in US history.

Can you go wrong with an action film featuring Tom Cruise? It helps the film reunites him with Doug Liman, who directed Edge of Tomorrow. Other cast members include Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, E. Roger Mitchell, Jesse Plemons, Lola Kirke, Alejandro Edda, Benito Martinez, Caleb Landry Jones and Jayma Mays.

Who Was Barry Seal?

Expect the film to take a bit of creative license with the story, but the man’s life is insane. Reading over his Wikipedia entry, you can see he was instrumental as an informant for the DEA and running covert ops for the CIA. He was an actual pilot, though he was fired from TWA. The trailer implies he was recruited from the airline.

From there he started running drugs for the Medellin Cartel earning up to $500,000 per flight. Pretty sure a commercial airline pilot isn’t pulling that in.

In the end, his testimony against the cartels put a price on his head, and he was assassinated in Baton Rouge, LA on February 19, 1986.

U.S. stocks finished little changed on Wednesday, 12 March 2014 after erasing early losses that followed a selloff in Asian and European equities. Stocks began the day in the red, but spent the first two hours of action in a steady climb off their lows. The cautious start took place amid broad-based weakness across major European markets where Germany's DAX, Great Britain's FTSE, and France's CAC all posted losses close to 1.0% apiece.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11.24 points, or 0.1%, to close at 16,340.01, slipping for the third day in a row. The Nasdaq Composite gained 16.14 points, or 0.4%, to finish at 4,323.33, halting a four-session losing streak. The S&P 500 ended up 0.57 point, or less than 0.1%, at 1,868.20.

Six out of ten sectors ended in the red. Utilities and technology sectors fared best among the index's 10 sectors.

Traders also attributed the morning selling to worries about China's slowdown and Russia-Ukraine tensions, and they also emphasized a lack of new catalysts.

The Russian troop occupation of Ukraine is still a serious concern among traders and investors at mid-week. This coming weekend could be pivotal in this geopolitical crisis. A referendum from Crimean citizens on secession is scheduled for Sunday, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region. The Group of Seven nations was set to release a statement on Wednesday to reiterate its solidarity regarding opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. economic data released Wednesday was again light and did not impact the markets. Economic data was limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Index, which fell 2.1% to follow last week's increase of 9.4%

In other news on Wednesday, industrial production in the European Union fell by 0.2% in January, from December, and was up 2.1% year-on-year. The decline in EU output was unexpected and could have an influence on the European Central Bank's monetary policy.

Concerns over the outlook for energy demand also continued to prevail in the wake of soft China data earlier in the week. April crude oil fell $2.04, or 2%, to settle at $97.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

In its weekly inventory report, the Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles jumped 6.2 million barrels for the week ended 7 March 2014. Market was looking for a climb of 2.3 million barrels. The report also showed that gasoline supplies fell by 5.2 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles declined by 500,000 barrels. Gasoline stockpiles were expected to fall by 1.8 million barrels, while distillates, which include heating oil, were seen down 900,000 barrels. poll.

Comex copper futures prices hit a nearly four-year low on Wednesday, 12 March 2014. Part of the selling pressure on copper comes from concerns about weakening Chinese economic growth.

Worries over China have also sent prices for copper sharply lower over the past three trading sessions, with prices holding below $3 a pound.

High-grade copper for May delivery closed up a penny, or 0.3%, at $2.96 a pound on Wednesday. Prices closed nearer the session high on tepid short covering after hitting a fresh contract and nearly four-year low early on. Weak economic data coming from China last weekend has helped to sink the copper market.

Participation was on the light side with 646 million shares changing hands at the NYSE floor.

Indian ADRs ended mixed on Wednesday. In the IT space, Infosys was down 6% at $56 and Wipro shed 0.88% at $13.4. In the banking space, ICICI Bank was up 1.4% at $41.5 and HDFC Bank rose 1% at $37.73.

Experts offer their insights into future geopolitical trends as the CERAWeek Conference wraps in Houston.

Both the United States and Europe are united in seeing the need for international monitors in the Crimea and maintaining a dialogue with Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine, but Europe’s close economic ties with Russia and dependence on Russian gas will make European leaders more reluctant to impose sanctions.

Angela Stent, professor at Georgetown University and author of The Limits of Partnership: U.S.-Russian Relations in the Twenty-First Century, told IHS CERAWeek attendees that it’s unlikely Crimea will be a part of a territorially intact Ukraine if residents in Crimea vote for independence in the March 16 referendum. Stent and other international policy experts discussed geopolitical trends and the role of oil and gas in those trends – and the implications that geopolitics might have on oil and gas -- as the conference wrapped up on March 7.

“The recent Ukrainian crisis feels like a cold war if you listen to the rhetoric of both sides, but it’s not the cold war,” said Stent. “We’re not ideological antagonists trying to carve up world between socialism and capitalism, our nuclear weapons are not pointedly targeted at each other anymore – and they could be.”

In the Cold War era, Communist Russia wasn’t integrated into the global economy, so a Russian invasion of a country didn’t have much economic impact. But Russia’s recent move into the Ukraine is impacting Russia by depressing its stock market and value of the ruble. “This global integration works both ways,” said Stent. “While it can work against Russia, it also constrains European countries from the extent they can impose sanctions.”

Differences have always existed within Ukraine, whose current borders were established following World War II. People from Western Ukraine, formerly part of Poland, speak Ukrainian and identify with Eastern Europe and don’t like the Russians, while those who live in eastern Ukraine speak Russian and identify with the former Soviet Union.

In 1991, Ukraine voted to separate from Russia to become a sovereign country, and it was assumed that Ukraine would continue to exist as a nation with internal differences. However, existing weakness in Ukraine’s existing government structures in the past two decades, the government’s inability to create a functioning state and to create a national identity on which everyone agreed, gave Russian President Vladimir Putin an opportunity to invade Crimea, said Stent. Disgust over Ukraine’s previous government also has had some groups seeing an alignment with Russia as a better solution.

Putin, who told former U.S. President George W. Bush in 2008 that he didn’t see Ukraine as a country, has invaded Crimea to prevent a territorially intact Ukraine from moving closer to the European Union’s orbit.

The US has taken control of a tanker full of oil loaded from a rebel-held port in Libya, the Pentagon says.

The raid by Navy Seals took place in international waters south of Cyprus, said spokesman Rear Adm John Kirby.

The Morning Glory's evasion of a naval blockade at the eastern port of Sidra prompted Libya's parliament to sack Prime Minister Ali Zeidan last week.

In a separate incident on Monday, an attack on an army base in the city of Benghazi killed several soldiers.

A bomb went off as people were leaving a graduation ceremony for officers, police said.

Analysis If Washington was trying to prove that it only recognises Libya's elected authorities, it has succeeded in doing so with this Navy Seals operation. The US has sent a clear message to both potential traders of illicit oil and to the armed groups blocking Libya's terminals that it will not be easy to sell the oil from rebel-held areas. Libya matters to the US partly because a failed state would be viewed as yet another failed US adventure abroad, after it backed the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. The intervention will also help to dispel at least one of the many suspicions and rumours among Libyans - that the West will deal with anyone to get hold of crude oil. It may also restore some of the Libyan government's credibility with people here, which has been lost over the past year. However, the dangers of this blockade escalating into an armed confrontation remain and it hinges on the government's next move.

'Illicit' cargo

The Morning Glory was the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held port since a separatist revolt against the central government in Tripoli erupted in July 2013. It is not clear where the tanker was headed.

Adm Kirby said the operation had been authorised by President Barack Obama and that no-one had been hurt.

"The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained," he said, adding that it would now be returned to a Libyan port.

The vessel was flagged in North Korea but officials in Pyongyang said it had been deregistered because of the incident.

It was said to have been operated by an Egyptian company.

The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says the US move is likely to act as a deterrent to any further attempts to illicitly buy oil from the rebel-controlled ports.

She says that after backing the 2011 rebellion against Muammar Gaddafi, the US does not want Libya to become a failed state.

The Libyan government is still struggling to assert its authority on rebel groups that helped to overthrow Col Gaddafi.##2793|Empty##2794|Federal Reserve officials have signaled they’re looking closely at signals the Bank of England is sending about interest rates as the Fed considers a new framework for its own guidance on the future path of rates.

"We rate EBAY INC (EBAY) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share and good cash flow from operations.

(AP)

Amid mounting evidence that the disappearance of the Malaysian plane was a deliberate act, authorities on Monday said the last words from the cockpit were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot as search operations covering 11 countries were intensified.

Evidence indicating that the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that went missing 10 days ago was sabotaged or hijacked was mounting after it emerged that the last message from the cockpit was spoken after someone had begun disabling one of the plane’s automatic tracking systems.

The last words — “All right, good night” — were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot.

“Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke,” Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a media briefing.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid are under scanner of the probe into the disappearance of the plane.

The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot’s final words.

The officials are also looking at the possibility whether the plane -with 239 people on board including five Indians and one Indian-Canadian – had taken advantage of the busy airways over the Bay of Bengal and avoided suspicion of military radars.

Malaysia’s defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, “I can confirm that search and rescue operations in the northern and southern corridors have already begun. Countries including Malaysia, Australia, China, Indonesia and Kazakhstan have already initiated search and rescue operations.”

A detailed map of the northern and southern corridors where the search operations were on was released on Monday.

Malaysia got in touch with countries along the northern and southern corridors about the flight. These countries include: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and France.

Australian was leading the search of the remote southern Indian Ocean for the missing plane.

Kazakhstan joined the search on Monday in the farthest northwest section of the search area, taking the total number of countries involved in the operation to 26.

During the last 24 hours, Prime Minister Najib Razak has spoken to the Prime Minister of Australia and the Premier of China. Malaysia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent diplomatic notes to all countries involved in the search operation, Hishammuddin said.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday assured Najib of “all assistance” by Indian authorities when the latter called him to seek India’s “technical assistance”.

Najib last week said authorities are trying to trace the plane across two possible corridors – in the north to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern corridor from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.

Hishamuddin said hopes had not been lost. “There has been no distress call, no ransom demand, no parties claiming responsibility…so there is always hope,” he said. He informed that aviation experts from China were joining the search team.

Hishamuddin said two Malaysian ships had been deployed and French civil aviation teams have also joined the search.

Australia is sending extra two P 3 Orions and C130 Hercules.

Malaysian authorities said they had begun probing the crew the day the aircraft disappeared. Police have visited the houses of the pilot and the co-pilot twice.

The Chinese authorities who had already cleared the passengers on board have been asked to take a re-look.

Jauhari said so far there had been no evidence from phone companies of any passenger trying to call when the plane turned around. Hishamuddin said Inmarsat had got six pings from the plane.

The satellite could see aircraft at alleviation and could give the time but not the location.

“At this point, I would like to stress that Malaysia has been co-operating with the FBI, Interpol and other relevant international law enforcement authorities since day one,” Hishamuddin said.

“Our priority has always been to find the aircraft. We would not withhold any information that could help. But we also have a responsibility not to release information until it has been verified by the international investigations team,” he said.

“With support from our many international partners, this new phase of the search is underway. Assets are being deployed, and search and rescue operations have begun. I wish to thank our partners from around the world for their continued support,” he added.

Earnings per share matched analysts' expectations and quarterly revenues topped their estimates. However, the company provided earnings guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2014, both below Street view.

"We generated strong results in our fourth quarter, with record earnings per share of $1.11, above the upper end of the guidance range we provided in our third quarter press release, as our sales and merchandise margin exceeded our expectations," Chairman and CEO Edward Stack said in a statement.

The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company reported net income of $138.64 million or $1.11 per share for the fourth-quarter, higher than $129.75 million or $1.03 per share in the prior-year quarter, which included about $0.03 per share for the 14th week.

On average, 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimated the company to report earnings of $1.11 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.

Net sales for the quarter increased 7.9 percent to $1.95 billion from $1.81 billion in the same quarter last year, and topped twenty-three Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate of $1.94 billion by a whisker. Net sales grew 12.5 percent on a on a 13-week basis.

The sales growth was attributable to consolidated same store sales growth, the opening of new stores, as well as strong e-commerce sales, which was 12.5 percent of total sales.

Consolidated same store sales increased 6.3 percent, with DICK'S Sporting Goods increasing 6.8 percent, while Golf Galaxy decreased 9.4 percent.

Adjusted for the additional 14th week in the year-ago quarter, consolidated same store sales increased 7.3 percent on a 13-week basis, with DICK'S Sporting Goods increasing 7.9 percent, while Golf Galaxy decreased 11.7 percent.

During the fourth quarter, the company opened six new DICK'S Sporting Goods stores, one new True Runner store and closed three underperforming Golf Galaxy stores, while also remodeling one DICK'S Sporting Goods store.

Looking ahead to the first quarter, Dick's Sporting continues to anticipate earnings in a range of $0.51 to $0.53 per share, on projected consolidated same store sales increase of 3 to 4 percent. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $0.54 per share on revenues of $1.47 billion for the quarter.

For fiscal 2014, the company currently expects earnings in a range of $3.03 to $3.08 per share, on projected consolidated same store sales growth of 3 to 4 percent. Street is currently looking for full-year 2014 earnings of $3.11 per share on annual revenues of $6.85 billion.

"As we look to 2014, we believe our robust and growing omni-channel network and exciting merchandising opportunities will support double-digit growth in earnings," Stack added.

DKS closed Monday's regular trading session at $54.33, up $0.51 on a volume of 2.26 million shares. In the past 52-week period, the stock has been trading in a range of $45.44 to $58.87.

The production at the two plants having an installed capacity of 3,10,000 units, has been disrupted since the past 25 days."The management and the union have been discussing the charter of demands for the period FY14 for the past 10 months. As a bipartite agreement was not reached, the Karnataka Labour Department has conducted seven tripartite meetings to reach a settlement. But the conciliation efforts have not yet resulted in an agreement, leading to the lockout," the Japanese auto major said in a statement.The statement also said even as the talks were on, a section of the workers, instigated by the union, has resorted to deliberate stoppage of the production line, and threatened supervisors and continuously disrupted business for the past 25 days. "In this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," the statement concluded.The workers' union, however, could not be contacted. Toyota Kirloskar Motor is a 89:11 joint venture between the world's largest auto company Toyota and the Pune-based Kirloskar Group, respectively.Set up in October 1997, the two plants at Bidadi employs over 6,400 people and has an installed capacity of 3,10,000 units per annum. The plant rolled out the first car in December 1999. While the first facility has an installed capacity of 1,00,000 units, the second plant has an installed capacity of 2,10,000 units. The two plants are set up on a sprawling 432 acre land parcel in the Bangalore suburb.The company manufactures the MPV segment leader Innova, the SUV Fortuner, from the first plant since October 1999, while it has also been rolling out the sedans Corolla Altis, the Etios, the hatchback Etios Liva and the luxe sedans Camry, and the Camry Hybrid from the second plant since December 2010. The company also sells the premium SUV brands Prado, the Land Cruiser and the hybrid sedan Prius as completely built units.##2806|Empty##2807|Empty##2808|Empty##2809|NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Applications for U.S. home mortgages fell in the latest week as interest rates edged higher, an industry group said on Wednesday.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, fell 2.1 percent to 373.3 in the week ended March 7.

The index hit its lowest level since December 2000 at the end of last year, soon after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would start reducing its $85 billion per month bond-buying program as the economy grows strong enough to stand on its own.

The interest rate on fixed 30-year mortgages averaged 4.52 percent last week, up 5 basis points from the previous week.

The MBA’s seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications fell 3.1 percent. The gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, fell 0.5 percent.

The survey covers over 75 percent of U.S. retail residential mortgage applications, according to MBA. (Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Leslie Adler)##2810|Why did this happen?

Fannie’s /quotes/zigman/226360/delayed /quotes/nls/fnma FNMA common shares closed down about 31%, while Freddie’s /quotes/zigman/226335/delayed /quotes/nls/fmcc FMCC were down about 27%.

FNMA Your browser does not support iframes.

The sudden plunge was a bit of a head scratcher for analysts, who said that the legislation’s elements were largely expected. Indeed, leading U.S. lawmakers have made it clear for some time that housing-finance-reform proposals would focus on mortgage-market stability, rather than getting cash to investors.

“Even if the shares had dropped immediately I would have been surprised because I thought the elements of the [proposal] were so well telegraphed,” said Brian Gardner, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “There was broad consensus that the bill would call for the unwinding of Fannie and Freddie, and I think that’s the news generally driving the sell off.”

Details released Tuesday show that the upcoming bill will use a prior congressional proposal as its base text, and that the two plans are quite similar.

“We continue to project that in a liquidation scenario there would be no value for [Fannie and Freddie] equity holders after the companies’ debt is extinguished and the Treasury preferred shares are repaid,” according to a research note from Edwin Groshans at Height Analytics.

The government-sponsored enterprises have been in conservatorship for more than five years. The once-flailing firms, which started receiving federal bailout funds in 2008, returned to profit in the last two years, thanks to a rebounding housing market.

Because of a 2012 amendment to the government’s bailout agreement, Fannie and Freddie send all of their profits to the U.S. Treasury Department. Including an upcoming payment to Treasury, both firms will have sent more to the government than was provided in bailout funds, and are on track to make taxpayers a profit.

Rather than expecting any legislation-related payout, many investors have pinned their hopes to lawsuits against the government for amending its bailout agreement in 2012.

Analysts said Tuesday that the chances for the bill to make it to the Senate floor this year are low because U.S. lawmakers are turning their attention to election season.

“Broader Democratic sponsorship might be required for it to pass. The House, however, would not likely support this bill even if it were to pass the Senate given that the House Financial Services Committee holds a very different view of how GSE reform should proceed,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a research note.

The political calculus facing U.S. lawmakers when it comes to voting on GSE reform is unappealing. Congress won’t want to make sweeping changes to the U.S. mortgage market or tackle the political hot buttons of Fannie and Freddie as they gear up to face voters. Also, many won’t want to vote for any measure that enriches Fannie and Freddie shareholders.

“It’s just political suicide,” Gardner said.

Despite being unable to build capital, Fannie and Freddie have seen their stocks skyrocket over the past year. Common shares for each firm have increased more than 1,200% in the last 12 months. The most heavily traded preferred shares for Fannie /quotes/zigman/494289/delayed /quotes/nls/fnmas FNMAS and Freddie fmckj /quotes/zigman/492416/delayed /quotes/nls/fmckj FMCKJ have also jumped, rising more than 500% over the past year.

Workers are losing confidence in the economy##2812|Empty##2813|Empty##2814|Herbalife has attracted a great deal of interest on Wall Street in the last year on the long and the short side of the market. Now, the company is the target of a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), according to a statement issued by the company:

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years. "

Investors on the short side of the market have every reason to celebrate, as the stock dropped following the company statement. But investors on the long side of the market have every reason to be concerned--though the company has warned about possible risks, including “the outcome of inquiries from regulatory authorities.”

At stake is Herbalife’s business model—a multilevel marketing organization whereby individual customer-distributors enlist other customer-distributors to work for them, in a pyramid style organization.

One of the things that some critics find at fault with in this model is that while a very few people make it to the top of the pyramid and reap off a huge pay-off, the vast majority loses money.

But isn’t this the case with most business ventures?

I do not believe the problem is with the very nature of a multi-level marketing network--but whether those who join it understand that nature. It's the difference between participating in the network as a customer, on the one hand, and buying products at inflated price (to pay for the commissions of the people who join the network earlier); and on the other hand, participating as an entrepreneur, developing a business that directly or indirectly markets the network products.

Hopefully the FTC investigation will come up with a ruling to clarify this confusion.##2815|DETROIT (AP) — General Motors' executives and government regulators will soon have to explain to Congress why it took years to recall 1.6 million compact cars with a known defect linked to 13 deaths. And the Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response, according to a person briefed on the matter.

Members of two congressional committees will likely ask why a proposed fix to the problem was never implemented and why GM didn't immediately tell car owners about the defect. Here's a look at the developments so far in the recall and what's ahead.

Q. Which cars is GM recalling?

A. GM is recalling a total of 1.6 million vehicles that were sold in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The recall includes the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 from the 2005-2007 model years; the Saturn Ion from the 2003-2007 model years; and the Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky from the 2006-2007 model years.

Q. What's the defect?

A. GM says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power. That can knock out power-assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags.

Q. What is GM doing to fix the problem?

A. Dealers will replace the ignition switches for free. GM will notify owners when the parts are available and repairs can begin, likely in April. Until then, it is warning owners to remove all items from their key rings, including key fobs if applicable. Only the vehicle key should be left on the ring.

Q. Have any deaths or accidents been linked to this defect?

A. The problem has been linked to 31 crashes and 13 front-seat deaths. In each of the fatal crashes, the air bags did not inflate. The engines did not shut off in all cases.

Q. When did GM first know about this problem?

In 2004, around the time that the Chevrolet Cobalt first went on sale, GM learned of at least one engine losing power and started investigating the problem. By 2007, it had received more reports, including at least one involving a fatal accident. According to a company timeline that was given to NHTSA, the company approved a redesign of the key head in 2005 but later cancelled that plan. The company also alerted dealers that an insert on the key head could fix the problem, but warranty records show only 474 customers have gotten the insert.

Q. Why didn't GM act more quickly?

A. GM opened at least two investigations after reports of engine stalling but closed them after taking no action. At the time, the company was juggling eight U.S. brands and losing billions each year, which led to its eventual bankruptcy in 2009. Now, GM has cut excess brands and bureaucracy and is solidly profitable. GM's new CEO has promised "an unvarnished" investigation into what happened.

Q. Did GM report these incidents to the government?

A. Yes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also received dozens of complaints from owners about the issue, dating as far back as 2005. NHTSA conducted several investigations into the problem but never ordered a recall.

Q. Why is Congress investigating?

A. Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote a 2000 law that was intended to improve communication between automakers and NHTSA and help NHTSA identify potential threats to consumers' safety. He wants to know if GM or NHTSA missed opportunities to fix the problem sooner, or if the legislation needs to be strengthened.

Q. What actions can the government take if it finds GM didn't act quickly enough?

A. NHTSA can fine GM up to $35 million. Automakers are required to report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them. Congress doubled the maximum fine to $35 million last year and could increase it further.

Q. What's at stake for GM?

A. It's unclear how much the recall will cost. Toyota Motor Corp. paid $48.8 million in total fines to the U.S. government for its handling of unintended acceleration recalls. It later paid more than $1 billion to settle a lawsuit from owners claiming their cars lost value. It still faces other lawsuits.

The case will also hurt GM's efforts to break from its pre-bankruptcy past. Older, less reliable products still on the road could still haunt GM.

Q. Where can I get more information?

Owners may contact Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020, Pontiac at 1-800-762-2737 or Saturn at 1-800-553-6000. They may also contact NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153) or go to www.safercar.gov.

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

Satellite images on a Chinese government website show suspected debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner floating off the southern tip of Vietnam, near the plane's original flight path, China's Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.

The revelation could provide searchers with a focus that has eluded them since the plane disappeared with 239 people aboard early Saturday.

The Xinhua report said the images from around 11 a.m. on Sunday appear to show "three suspected floating objects" of varying sizes, the largest about 79 feet by 72 feet.

The report includes coordinates of a location in the sea off the southern tip of Vietnam and east of Malaysia. The images originally were posted on a national defense technology website.

No other governments have confirmed the Xinhua report, which did not say when Chinese officials became aware of the images and associated them with the missing plane.

The search for the plane, which left Kuala Lumpur for Beijing before disappearing early Saturday, has encompassed 35,800 square miles of Southeast Asia and on Wednesday expanded toward India.

Two-thirds of the passengers on the flight were Chinese, and the Chinese government has put increasing pressure on Malaysian officials to find solve the mystery of the plane's disappearance.

Also Wednesday, it was revealed that the last message from the cockpit of the missing flight was routine. "All right, good night," was the sign-off transmitted to air traffic controllers five days ago.

Then the Boeing 777 vanished as it cruised over the South China Sea toward Vietnam, and nothing has been seen or heard of the jetliner since.

Those final words were picked up by controllers and relayed in Beijing to anguished relatives of some of the people aboard Flight MH370.

The new Chinese reports of the satellite images came after several days of sometimes confusing and conflicting statements from Malaysian officials.

Earlier Wednesday, the Malaysian military officially disclosed why it was searching on both sides of country: A review of military radar records showed what might have been the plane turning back and crossing westward into the Strait of Malacca.

That would conflict with the latest images on the Chinese website.

For now, authorities said the international search effort would stay focused on the South China Sea and the strait leading toward the Andaman Sea.

Chinese impatience has grown.

"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."

Flight MH370 disappeared from civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. Saturday at an altitude of about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing problems.##2817|Gold price extended gains to a third session on Thursday, scaling fresh six-month highs as investors sought to hedge their bets against geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and economic slowdown fears in China.

Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic and political uncertainty, when the metal is preferred by investors over riskier assets such as equities. It has gained 14 percent so far this year on the global uncertainties.

A recent bond default in China and a weak exports report sent equities and base metals lower. More data on Thursday showed China's economy slowed markedly in the first two months of the year, with growth in investment, retail sales and factory output all falling to multi-year lows.

Spot gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,371.76 an ounce by 0737 GMT, after jumping 1.3 percent on Wednesday. The metal earlier on Thursday hit $1,374.85, its highest since Sept. 10.

Technical buying has also been supportive of price momentum in the last two sessions, especially after prices cleared a recent high near $1,355 an ounce.

"Given bullion's technical break, it may be at risk of profit-taking in the near term, barring an escalation of Eastern European tensions," HSBC analysts said in a note.

"Geopolitical events can have a pronounced, but sometimes short-lived impact on gold."

Reuters technicals analyst Wang Tao said spot gold faces resistance at $1,375-$1,377, a break above which will open the way towards $1,433.31, the Aug. 28 high.

The biggest factor driving gold prices at the moment is the stand-off between the West and Russia over Ukraine.

The EU agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the drive to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.

New money has been flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds in recent weeks, in a sign of investor confidence, after record outflows last year.

However, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 1.50 tonnes to 811.20 tonnes on Wednesday - the first decline since Feb. 19. Physical demand has been subdued due to the price rally, with prices in China - the biggest bullion consumer - trading at a discount to spot prices.##2818|Technology Trader

US-based Chiquita Brands and Ireland's Fyffes Plc said Monday that they are merging, a deal that would create the world's biggest banana supplier with annual revenue of $4.6 billion.

In the stock-for-stock transaction Chiquita shareholders will own approximately 50.7 percent of the new company, named ChiquitaFyffes Plc, and Fyffes shareholders owning the remainder, the companies announced in a joint statement.

The combined company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and based in Ireland. The Chiquita and Fyffes brands will also continue, the statement read.

The agreement "creates a global banana and other fresh produce company with approximately $4.6 billion in annual revenues."

Chiquita is one of the top global marketer and distributors of fresh food products, including bananas and packaged salads. Fyffes, though not quite as big, is also a major global player.

"This is a natural strategic partnership that combines two complementary companies of long history," said Chiquita chief executive Ed Lonergan.

As well as bananas, the new company will have a "significant presence" in the sale of packaged salads, melons and pineapples.

Chiquita, Dole Food and Fresh Del Monte Produce -- controlled about two-thirds of the global banana market, according to 2007 UN figures.

Fyffes and Ecuador's Exportadora Bananera Noboa rounded off the list of top five banana companies, according to the figures.

The merged ChiquitaFyffes will have an operating presence in more than 70 countries and a workforce of some 32,000 people.

"Chiquita and Fyffes anticipate that the transaction will potentially provide annualized recurring before tax overhead and operational synergies of at least $40 million by the end of 2016," said the statement, adding that the transaction is expected to be complete this year.

Lonergan will serve as chairman, while Fyffes executive chairman David McCann will become the combined company's chief executive officer.

McCann described the deal as "transformative".

"We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers," he said.

Patrick Higgins, an analyst at Goodbody said the debt of the merged company would be at a more manageable level.

Chiquita posted a loss of $16 million for 2013, a sharp improvement after losing $405 million in 2012.

Fyffes however announced preliminary results for 2013 showing a profit of 26.1 million euros ($34.87 million), up 9.8 percent, while sales rose 6.3 percent to 1.08 billion euros.

According to figures from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), as of 80 percent of all bananas come from Latin America, with Ecuador Costa Rica and Colombia as the main exporters.##2822|Empty##2823|Companies in advanced countries are in a stronger position today but they are not investing enough to boost the global economy.

Such activity continued in the first two months of 2014, he said in his column, which appeared in The Guardian.

But while shareholders have clearly benefited from companies' unwillingness to invest their ample cash, the bulk of the injected money has been circulating only in the financial sector.

"Little of it has directly benefited economies that are struggling to boost their growth rates, expand employment, avoid creating a lost generation of workers, and address excessive income inequality,'' said Mohamed El-Erian.

Listing several factors that pose as constraints, he said a lot more time, effort and global co-ordination is required.

That is not happening fast enough to attain the faster growth that their citizens' well being - and that of the global economy - urgently requires.

It is understandable that these companies are reluctant to invest in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

But they need to take a constructive view of the long term requirement for growth.

The debate over the bonus cap by the European Union (EU), which restricts bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve, is gathering steam.

One of the architects of the EU's cap on bankers' bonuses, Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian Green Member of the European Parliament, has called for the UK government to be sued for allowing banks to sidestep the new rules.

His call for action coincides with two more high street banks preparing to hand their bosses up to £1mil in extra pay.

Lloyds bank boss, António Horta-Osório, was given £900,000 in shares to sidestep EU bonus cap, said The Guardian.

He receives shares in the bailed-out bank on top of a £1.1mil salary to ensure he does not suffer fall in earnings.

Earlier, HSBC announced it was handing its boss, Stuart Gulliver, £1.7mil in shares a year to maintain his pay package.

Barclays faced criticism last month when it revealed that its bonus pool would rise from £2.2bil to £2.4bil even though profits fell across the group.

Investment bank bonuses increased from £1.4bil to £1.6bil, with profits falling 37%.

Barclays chief executive officer, Antony Jenkins told The Telegraph that he was forced to increase bonus payments to senior executives after hundreds of key staff left the investment bank in America.

It looks like these banks are faced with a pack of falling dominoes.

Shareholders need to exercise some patience in waiting for the long term results.

Commodity trade financing in Singapore is heating up with new Asian entrants gearing up to give a good fight to the traditional European banks.

While traditionally dominated by European banks in the past, banks such as the DBS Group and more recently, Chinese banks such as ICBC, Bank of China and China Construction Bank have also muscled their way into the business.

This follows the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011 which caused many European banks to rein in their lending, said the Singapore Business Times (SBT).

Since then, European banks have made a comeback as such facilities give commodity traders access to more liquidity at a lower cost.

Commodity inventory financing includes traders pledging a warehouse receipt for a secured loan to a repurchase transaction where the bank takes over the ownership of the commodities for a short period of time.

A certain level of expertise, familiarity and knowledge of risk involved are required for a successful set-up.

The growth story in Asia for commodity trade financing is encouraging.

But traders have to be mindful that in the euphoria of rising volumes, they do not start speculating on these trades.

Columnist Yap Leng Kuen agrees that companies should take a more proactive role in global investment.##2824|Empty##2825|Colorado collected almost two million dollars (£1.2 million) in taxes on cannabis in January, the first month where retail sales of the newly legalised drugs were allowed.

The figures indicate that the 59 firms selling the drug made about $14m (£8.4m) in gross sales that month.

Colorado became the first country to legalise cannabis in 2012, but commercial sale did not begin until 1 January 2014.

If medical marijuana stores are included, the state collected $3.5 million (£2.1 million) in taxes, intensifying the debate on how Colorado should spend the money.

In comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million (£1.6 million) in alcohol excise taxes in January last year.

Last week, Washington DC voted by an overwhelming majority to decriminalise the possession of marijuana and smoking it at home.

Governor John Hickenlooper has sent the legislature a detailed $134 million (£80 million) proposal for recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to children and more advertising to discourage driving while high on the drug.

Recently, the US President Barack Obama described cannabis use as "not very different from cigarettes” and no more dangerous than alcohol, while admitting he smoked marijuana when he was younger.

He instructed the Department of Justice to stop prosecuting banks who accepted business from firms selling cannabis. Many shops had been unable to gain access to banking services and have been forced to operate on a cash-only basis, without access to financial services or credit.

Mr Obama’s comments came after New York announced it would join 20 other states, and Washington DC, in permitting the sale, possession and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.##2826|Michael Noonan: There is something going on in the gold and silver market, and it is difficult to ascertain exactly what it is. Perhaps it can best be described as a change in market behavior that may be defining a potential change in trend.

For many, the presumption has been, “Gold and silver are going to go to the moon, for the following reason[s]….” What followed was then a litany of the same facts that have been widely known for well over a year, and the same types of graphs depicting various aspects, [depleted gold stocks, cost of production v current price, etc], very often nicely colored and reproduced, but to no practical effect, at least in terms of the direction of price for gold and silver which continued lower until the end of 2013.

Consider the latest in an ongoing series of unfolding events: Ukraine/Crimea/disruptions in governments there/Russia protecting its “turf”/the EU and Obama threatening, [never with any apparent way of following through], Putin over how the EU and US “feels” how the Ukrainian situation should be resolved as both failing entities see fit, naturally in their favor. Obama doing what he does best, reading from a teleprompter, and threatening to impose sanctions in an area where the US has no right or justification to be meddling, is engaging in yet more misguided international [lack of] diplomacy, just like in Syria.

There is the potential for war, and war of any kind is uppermost on Obomba’s agenda, yet the stock market and PMs market seems nonplussed. War is the last effort for distracting the masses from the final stages of the decline of the United States, already well underway into Third World status, but not yet officially recognized. War has always been the solution for the elites. It is the Rothschild formula for successful domination by financially ruining countries that engage in costly, [read profitable for the elites], wars.

It would be better if we could present something pertinent to add to the mix, but everything we read about what is going on, and how it will impact gold and silver, all makes for interesting reading, but all also way off in terms of market timing that is to launch the next [yet to appear] bull market for PMs. 2014 is now THE year for the “big breakout.” It has to be presented as such because calling 2013 the big year will no longer work.

Will PMs take off in 2014? Maybe. Let us be among the few to acknowledge that we do not know. It may or may not occur in 2014. The same people calling for 2013 to be the year have just changed the digit from a “3″ to a “4″ and are now parroting the same outlook that failed for last year to happen this year, just with a greater sense of urgency, or maybe desperation. It is possible that a bull market can fail for 2014, too.

Irrespective of whatever the market does, the one timing factor that is of the utmost importance is that of accumulating physical possession of gold and silver. The time has been and continues to be “do it now!” No one can trust what the elites will do, via all their controlled Western governments, with ALL political leaders marching to the incessant drum of fiat takeover and destruction of every possible nation they can control. Ukraine is an example of such a [clumsy and doomed to fail] attempt to bring that strategically important [to Russia] nation into the rotten fold of central banker control. When the collapse of US power and the fast-fading US “dollar” as the world’s reserve currency falls, in the latter stages of happening, the best and most reliable financial saver will be the value of physical gold and silver, recognized everywhere in the world, except by Western central bankers. The inevitable collapse of the fiat Federal Reserve Note, [FRN], aka “the dollar,” will lead to a Venezuela-type devaluation of everything held in the form of paper: currency, bank accounts, bonds, stocks, pensions, etc.

Everyone who chooses to hold any form of paper asset will suffer financially and suffer dramatically. Everyone who owns and personally holds physical gold and silver will survive in much better shape. From our perspective, it does not matter what you paid! We bought silver at $40, $45, even $48 for the same reason for buying at recently at $21. The same for gold. We paid as high as $1700, and recently $1300. The higher prices are what the PMs were at the time of planed, routine purchases, as a form of protection against the ravages of fiat destruction. Like we said last week, price is temporary, possession is permanent.

At no time was there ever any concern for having overpaid or wasted rearview mirror regret for not having gotten some of the PMs cheaper. The focus on price is misplaced. The focus is on financial survival, and a year too early is far better than a day too late.

There are some who believe paying attention to charts that reflect the manipulation of exchange-priced gold and silver is a waste of time. Some argue the “real price” is higher, as much as $100 or $200, at times. This is true, if you are China, Russia, India, Turkey, Dubai, and buying by the physical by the tonne. Even under those circumstances, their purchase price is still related to the paper price, and most of us are buying in considerably lesser quantities. Until things change, which they eventually will, the best barometer is the charts that are available.

We opened with a sense of some changes going on in the PM markets, of late, specifically the uncorrected rallies since 31 December 2013. The last three weeks in the gold chart show smaller ranges, [a lessening of buyer demand, and selling supply, as well], but the buyers have been winning the battle, of late.

Some of the sense of unease with the rally is attributable to the punishing corrections that earmarked last year, especially April and June. We are seeing some $10 price corrections, but the difference now is recovery has been immediate, and holding. What we know about market trends that change is that change takes place over time, and there has not been much time to say a trend change has occurred in gold, at least in weekly and monthly charts.

The down trend has weakened, and the process of change is better monitored on the daily chart, where a trend change has been registered.

For consistency and simplicity, we define a trend change to the upside as a higher high, a higher low, and another higher high, and it is the latter that determines a change has taken place. [This has not happened on the weekly chart]. One can define a change in any other way, as long as it is consistent.

There are two things to note on the daily, and let us add that all of the developing price activity is unfolding during events all over the world, and acknowledging all of the purported shortages on the exchanges, depletion numbers, record sales of coins to the public, etc, etc, etc. How much of what you consider to be critically important to the price of gold is reflected in the charts?

The first aspect of importance is the thin lines connecting the swing highs and lows. If they were not shown, you would not likely notice how the rallies since December have been greater in length than the rallies prior to December. Same for the corrections. Prior to December, they lasted longer and declined more in price. This is a potentially significant change in market behavior.

The second note is where the current rally has stopped: just under the October swing high. The rally did not reach the swing high, [It may next week, but all we can do is deal with what is known], and that could be viewed as a typical indication of a rally in a broader down trend. At the same time, price has not declined away from that swing high area, either. [It may next week, etc].

Price reacted lower by $20 on the jobs number, for those who still believe in the reliability of those Obama adminstration-generated [fictitious and misleading] numbers. What was interesting was the market’s ability to recover half the loss, late in the day and before the exchange powers decided where the “closing price” would be.

There is a third point to make, which we did when analyzing the daily silver chart after this one. It is the increase in volume and the location of the close. The location of the close, about mid-range the bar, indicates buyers were present. The increase in volume says that the strength from the buyers was sufficient to rally price back, somewhat. The conclusion is to watch for additional support to enter the market.

It is not important to know what the market will do from one day to the next. By seeing the location of the close of any bar, how wide or narrow it is, what the volume is, all give clues on what to expect could happen. With that information, one can then be prepared to take advantage of what the market is telegraphing and gain a market edge for a position.

Will price correct more next week? The probability is greater for a yes than a no. The fact that there was some buying evident on Friday may mean any further correction could be limited. Even if the correction extends lower, at least we know there is no reason to buy, at this point. Not being long, the market can correct as low as it will go, and there is no risk in watching. If activity shows more evidence of buying, being prepared to take action ahead of time eliminates being surprised and can lead to a new long position that has less risk and a greater probability of a profitable outcome.

This is the purpose of reading developing market activity. The market almost always tips its hand, as it were.

Silver continues to be somewhat weaker than gold, but the relatively small bar lower, last week, suggests sellers were not having an easy time pushing price lower. That is a piece of information to use when viewing the daily chart.

Here is where greater detail can pay off. Silver had an obvious breakout from the wide trading range to the upside, in February. Right now, price is in the process of retesting that breakout. When you know that a retest of a significant breakout can lead to a low risk trade, you more closely monitor daily, even intra day activity, for clues that indicate a decline is ending and a rally is likely to develop.

The breakout level is the $20.50 area. We drew a line connecting the two smaller swing highs in February and March. A parallel support line was then drawn from the February low to create the lower, support channel line. We now know, in advance, that price is nearing potential support.

What makes the developing analysis more pertinent is the high volume associated with the wide range sell-off on Friday. On its face, the sell-off may look negative. When you remember that smart money sells high and buys low, the increased volume would not be smart money selling; that was more likely 7 bars earlier. However, after that increased selling 7 bars earlier, what was the market response? It moved sideways, not lower.

We see this as a more likely change from weak-handed buyers selling into stronger-handed buyers. The analysis can always be wrong, but no action has yet been taken on it, so there is no risk involved. What the observations do is allow for preparation for a buy, if and only if there are signs to go long. Those signs would depend on what your trading rules are. We know what ours are, and if a potential buy opportunity is setting up, we will be prepared, base solely on what information the market is sending.

The number of coins sold this month, last month, last year, or what happens in Ukraine will not help anyone time a buying opportunity better than what the market advertises on a more reliable time frame and with greater clarity. Predicting what a market may or may not do is for egos and margin calls. Following market activity that leads to a more obvious conclusion, minimizes risk exposure, and increases the probability of a profitable outcome is our hands down choice.

Charlie Bean was addressing the bosses of around 170 of the region’s largest businesses at the North East Chamber of Commerce’s President’s Club, held at Rockliffe Hall in County Durham.

Bean, a Professor of Economics who has lectured at the London School of Economics and has been a visiting Professor at Stanford University, spoke to the business leaders about what needs to happen if the recovery is to be sustained – and how the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is supporting it.

He said: “Much of the recovery has been on the back of higher consumer spending and housing investment.

“For the recovery to be both sustained and sustainable, however, we really want to see three things happen: business investment needs to pick up, a revival in productivity growth and an expansion in net exports.”

“It is now five years since we cut bank rate to its historic low of 0.5% and launched our asset purchase programme. Those five years have been tough for both businesses and households. But they surely would have been even tougher had we not taken that action.

“The MPC will be doing its utmost to ensure that recovery is not nipped in the bud.

“But when the time does come for us to start raising bank rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.”

Bean has served in a variety of public policy roles, including as consultant to HM Treasury and as a special adviser to both the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons and to the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament. His comments were welcomed by the NECC’s president Dave Laws.

Laws, said: “I was delighted to welcome Charlie Bean to the region. We have seen via NECC’s Quarterly Economic Survey and the Government’s GVA statistics that the recovery is well underway in the North East, and the positivity of the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England’s speech seemed to rubber stamp that.

“Charlie’s speech also delivered an important message to businesses and that is that while things are getting better, but we must continue to work hard if we are to secure sustained economic recovery.”

NECC President’s Club represents firms and organisations from sectors including services, manufacturing and professional, to local authorities, housing groups and the public sector, and its members employ around 25% of the region’s workforce.##2828|The devs are letting the community decide starting today. Now (September 20) through September 30, PUBG’s event mode is turning into a beta surrounding the flare gun. Should it become normal loot across all three maps? That’s the question the devs hope to answer at the end of the month.

For me, it’s not even a question. Add it. It gives folks who might rarely get airdrops a better chance at wielding the game’s best weapons. Plus, it pushes the action in the early to mid-game as players fight over two sets of top-end gear.

The flare gun mechanics we saw from the ‘Metal Rain’ event mode are still here. Using a flare inside the circle will call in a weapon/gear drop. Using it outside brings in an armored UAZ. PUBG is planning to replace the armored UAZ with “something special later this year.”

The number of weapons and gear from the air drops will change based on what mode you’re playing. Solo/duo matches will only have one set, while squads get two sets. This beta focuses on squad matches so two sets of weapons will be inside each package.

The devs are also tweaking the spawn rates of the flare gun. “Finding a flare gun should be a very rare thing as the potential rewards can be game-changing,” says the developer. We’ll see how rare the spawns are as the beta goes on. Hopefully, the devs are also tweaking how frequently flare guns can be used. Last event, there was only a set amount of drops (I think two?) per safe circle. Just let us use them as soon as we get it.

The risk/reward will also be even higher during the beta test. If a giant ass box floating in the sky wasn’t enough to tell you where it’s at, an icon will also appear on the map showing everyone where an airdrop has been dropped.

I hope PUBG ends up getting the flare gun in normal mode, with a couple of caveats.

First, the spawn rate has to be low. And it has to be spread out. Putting flare guns in hotspots will just make these places even busier and lead to bigger massacres that hurt the mid-game.

Second, don’t push silly mechanics that determine when we can use it. If there are four teams with flare guns across the map, let them all use it whenever they want. Don’t place arbitrary limits on how many planes can be dropping them at one time.

I always had fun playing the special flare gun event modes. Hearing that screech as the flare gun streaked across the sky never gets old. And knowing there’s probably an AWM tucked inside the package means I can’t resist fighting over it.

What do you think about the flare gun potentially becoming a normal spawn? Good idea? Bad idea?##2829|Beijing: China has decided to double the yuan's daily trading band to 2 percent from March 17, the country's central bank has said on Saturday.

Chinese banks can exchange the yuan in the foreign exchange spot market at 2 percent above or below the central parity against the US dollar announced by the China Foreign Exchange Trading System each trading day, according to the statement from the People's Bank of China (PBoC).

The move will meet market demands and further liberalise the Yuan or Renminbi exchange rate, the statement said.

Focussing on Ukraine, analysts everywhere are predicting which way things will go. Russia is still present in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine, and NATO is monitoring the situation from AWACS jets from nearby Poland and Romania. With the situation still tense, investors have looked to Gold as a safe haven, which may only be a temporary measure. As for the crisis escalating, Russia risks severing essential economic ties to Europe, especially at a time when the Rouble is already suffering, so Russia could stick to the negotiating table instead.

As gold prices are typically flat during March, we may see spot gold more or less plateau at current levels, at the most steady rises without any significant upturns in the market until May.

With regards to long term forecasts, Morgan Stanley has a negative outlook for 2014-15. While mentioning the positives of the Fed’s stimulus, also noted increased regulatory pressure on the financial sector and lowered Gold imports to India, counterbalancing strong demand from China. Goldman Sachs also feels that Gold’s recent performance will eventually turn negative, and as China has said it expects that Gold imports will reduce by about 17%.

However, Coutts are remaining bullish, citing rising incomes in China fuelling demand for luxury items such as jewellery. It could be that Chinese demand may act as a safety net against any sudden falls in the long term, and with the economic recovery continuing in the US and Europe, the market may yet be a little more confident overall; investors may steer away from Gold in favour of alternative investments. If the crisis in the Ukraine continues though, investors may continue to seek Gold as a haven investment, going forward, pushing prices up.##2831|Oliver Smith, Guy Bentley

Vodafone has confirmed a deal to buy Spanish cable operator Ono with an offer that values the firm at €7.2bn (£6bn).

Ono is the second-largest provider of broadband internet, pay television and fixed services in Spain, a market in which Vodafone has seen a reduction in both mobile customer numbers and earnings in recent years.

Vodafone Group chief executive Vittorio Colao, said:

The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction - together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme - will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.



Vodafone made an earlier offer of around €7bn that was rejected but following resumed negotiations Vodafone raised its bid to between €7.2bn and €7.3bn.

On Friday Vodafone and Ono reached an agreement in principle and both sides raced over the weekend to finalise the deal.

The deal will allow Vodafone to add Ono’s pay-TV and fixed line services to its mobile offering, positioning it as a so-called quad play provider in the Spanish market, as well as allowing it to reduce the costs of carrying calls on its mobile network around the country.

Until Friday Ono’s shareholders – including investment funds Providence Equity Partners, Thomas H Lee Partners and Quadrangle Capital – had been looking for an exit by a floating the company on the Madrid stock exchange. The takeover fits with Vodafone’s strategy of spending up to £25bn, generated from the £84bn sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless, to invest in its core European networks.##2832|Chiquita and Fyffess Fruit(Photo : Twiiter Photo Section)

The $526 million transaction, which represents 14 percent of the banana business across the world will allow for involved individuals to discuss future deals especially during an age when grocery stores are slimming the fruit's prices in tough economic times Reuters reported Monday.

"Two big fruit companies have felt the downward pressure of the big retail buyers on their margins and consolidation appears to them to be a strategy for survival," Bananalink, a British-based group who pushes for bananas and pineapples business that is environmentally friendly.

"The first three (companies) on a global scale are not too far away from each other, whereas Fyffes was a good deal smaller. Now a firm number one has been created, there will be some impetus for further consolidation in the sector," David Holohan, an analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin told Reuters.

"We looked at it and thought we could create a much stronger competitor. The overlap between the businesses is de minimis," Ed Lonergan, CEO at Chiquita who is chairman of the merger told Reuters.

According to Reuters, environmentally-friendly farming activists are concerned the new deal will put further strain current economic worries, and the affect on more independent growers, and the environment.

"There's downward pressure that's creating a race for the bottom. The big producers are under pressure too - the banana business is not working for anybody," Michael Gidney, chief executive of British charity The Fairtrade Foundation told Reuters.

"The banana market is dysfunctional and this merger feels like further proof," Gidney told Reuters.

The deal gives Chiquita investors one a share in the company for every one they have.

The news was also fairly bleak for Urban Outfitters, which also saw revenues well below expectations. The company said they are "very cautious" about the first quarter. There's clearly a problem with the main brand: Urban Outfitters saw same-store sales down 9 percent, but Anthropologie was up 10 percent, and Fre People up 20 percent.

3) There is a rather confusing story in The Wall Street Journal this morning that Securities and Exchange Commission regulators are considering a pilot program that would allow trading in stocks in increments other than a penny. Why?

Because once you go beyond the 500 or so largest stocks, the remaining 3,000 or so companies have little or no trading volume or analyst coverage. , Allowing trading in increments other than a penny, the argument goes, would attract more trading and more analyst coverage.

The SEC has been considering a pilot for ages, but this time something will likely happen. There will be a pilot, perhaps as early as this year. It would likely entail trading in nickels for stocks with small market capitalization (likely below $500 million) and low volume. Would it attract more trading and analyst coverage? Perhaps, but there is considerable push-back on this.

Some don't want the public to pay more to trade stocks, even if it means more liquidity.

plant in Gujarat by the US Food and Drug Administration due to violation of manufacturing norms.

According to the information available on USFDA website, the regulator has issued an import alert, which enables 'detention without physical examination of drugs from firms which have not met drug GMPs (Good Manufacturing Practices)'.

Comments from the company could not be obtained immediately.

This is the first import alert for any of Sun Pharma's plants from the USFDA, which has been cracking down heavily on firms such as Ranbaxy and Wockhardt that have not complied with its manufacturing norms.

While all plants of Ranbaxy in India have been banned from exporting drugs to the US, Wockhardt has also faced similar actions on its two plants in India.

As per Sun Pharmaceutical Industries' website, Karkhadi plant manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulations. The company has 10 manufacturing sites in India.

Earlier this week the company had voluntarily recalled 2,528 bottles of its generic version of diabetes drug Glumetza in the US market on the basis of a customer complaint. It was found that some bottles of Glumetza contained medicines to treat epilepsy.

PTI##2843|Judges of the second senate explaining the verdict on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) at Germany's Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) in Karlsruhe, March 18, 2014. Germany's Constitutional Court confirmed on Tuesday the legality of the euro zone's bailout fund, upholding a preliminary ruling from the height of the debt crisis in 2012 that gave an initial green light to the ESM. The court in Karlsruhe reiterated that the 700 billion euro ($975 billion) fund did not violate the rights of the Bundestag to decide on budgetary matters as long as the lower house of parliament had sufficient oversight powers over the ESM.

Karlsruhe, Germany - Germany's Constitutional Court confirmed on Tuesday the legality of the euro zone's bailout fund, upholding a preliminary ruling from the height of the debt crisis in 2012 that gave an initial green light to the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

The court reiterated that the 700 billion euro ($975 billion) fund did not violate the rights of the Bundestag lower house of parliament to decide on budgetary matters as long as the lower house of parliament had sufficient oversight powers over the ESM.

“The result is clear: the constitutional complaint...is inadmissible and on top of that unfounded,” said the president of the court, Andreas Vosskuhle, standing to read the verdict along with his red-robed colleagues in the courtroom.

“Despite the liabilities assumed, the budgetary autonomy of the German Bundestag is sufficiently safeguarded,” he told the court in Karlsruhe in south-western Germany.

The court said measures had been taken to ensure Germany's liability to the ESM was limited to 190 billion euros, with any increase subject to approval or veto by the Bundestag.

The more than 35,000 plaintiffs included academics and lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc and the opposition, who argued that the ESM amounts to an illegal transfer of sovereignty from Berlin to Brussels.

The Constitutional Court has a history of delaying EU treaties to test their compatibility with German law, usually reaching the conclusion that parliament has to be consulted fully and taxpayers' liabilities must be limited.

STILL DOUBTS ON OMT

As expected, Vosskuhle did not make any direct comments on the legality of the European Central Bank's “unlimited” bond-buying scheme, the flagship emergency measure taken since the debt crisis began four years ago.

The German court took the unprecedented decision last month to defer a ruling on the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme - which is credited with saving the euro zone - to the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg.

The ECJ is seen as less of a threat to the OMT, which was announced by ECB chief Mario Draghi in 2012 and helped to keep the euro zone together by promising potentially unlimited purchases of the sovereign bonds of member states.

The German court could still give its own verdict after an ECJ ruling, which is likely to take over a year. It has already said there was good reason to think the OMT exceeded the ECB's mandate and violated a ban on the ECB funding governments.

Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg bank, said it would have been a major surprise if the Constitutional Court had contradicted its own preliminary verdict from 2012.

“It's important that we have certainty about the legality of the ESM in the eyes of Karlsruhe because it is central to the financial stability architecture of the euro zone,” he said.

But the court had “created much bigger trouble” with its negative comments on the OMT in February, “because without that, the ESM is simply too small - it is not big enough to defend countries like Spain and Italy”, said Schulz.

Gunnar Beck, a Eurosceptic law expert at London University, said the ruling did not alter his view that the ECJ and German court “might compromise and limit the OMT while allowing the ECB to engage in quantitative easing on an unprecedented scale”. - Reuters##2844|BAML analyst John Murphy investigates the recent General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) recall, speculating on what kind of effects it will have on the company.

The events surrounding the General Motors recall of 1.6mm vehicles are tragic, but the financial impact to General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) will likely be small. General Motors’ recall reserves appear more than sufficient to cover the cost of repair and potential liabilities. However, the issue will take time to resolve and sentiment on the stock could remain depressed.

General Motors: Unfortunate tragedy, but impact on stock likely limited

The deaths associated with the alleged faulty ignition switch on 1.6mm old General Motors vehicles are a human tragedy. From a financial perspective, the impact to GM is likely small, in our view. General Motors’ recall reserves appear more than sufficient to cover the cost of repair and potential liabilities while the sales impact will likely be negligible based on past recalls, in our view. Furthermore, although GM may choose to pay for costs associated with the alleged faulty ignition switches, the total liability may not even reside at General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), but at the former bankrupt entity though the issue may take time to resolve. Therefore, we believe the ultimate financial impact will be relatively small. Nonetheless, the headlines are depressing sentiment on the stock, and DOJ/congressional investigations are never good news, so the negative impact on the stock may linger temporarily.

Reserves are robust, repairs likely more than covered

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) reserves about $500 per vehicle wholesaled for recalls and similar costs for the lifetime of a vehicle, which in total equates to about $3bn annually. Total reserves at the end of 2013 stand at about $7.2bn. We’d estimate the cost of the repair at less than $50 per occurrence including labor, so on a base of 1.6mm vehicles the total cost of repairs would be about $80mm, well below existing reserves.

Vehicles no longer sold in US so impact on volume is limited

Historically large recalls have had a temporary impact on volumes for the vehicles impacted, which would be a risk. However, all of the vehicles being investigated in the US so far are no longer being sold including the Chevrolet Cobalt, Pontiac G5, Saturn Ion, Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice, and Saturn Sky. Furthermore, about half of the volume is from the discontinued brands of Pontiac and Saturn.

Sentiment may take time to recover

Although the basics of the recall and investigation may not have a material impact on the stock in the long run, a DOJ and congressional investigation are never good news. Until the rhetoric eases the negative pressure on the stock may persist. We believe there should be more concern about the soft start to US sales early in 2014 and elevated inventory levels, but even these risks are temporary, in our view, as sales appear poised to accelerate into the key Spring selling season.##2845|Candy Crush Saga’s Developer Has a $7.6 Billion Valuation

It's a simple game with cute visuals, but Candy Crush Saga is more than just a bite-sized mobile game; it's a cash-making monster.

Candy Crush Saga's developer, King, has opened up an IPO that if successful will lead to a valuation of $7.6 billion. Candy Crush Saga is responsible for 78% of the company's revenue.

More than anything this demonstrates why many developers have moved to the mobile space. The market is absurdly profitable if tapped into. It's not slowing down, either. The mobile market has continued to grow heading into Spring 2014, giving developers an even larger install base to produce content for than ever before.

One can argue that Candy Crush Saga isn't a very creative game, either. It's a variation of the well-known Bejeweled, a 13 year old game, that has done just enough to capture the attention of millions of smartphone owners around the world.

King recently came under public scrutiny for filing a lawsuit against Stoic's The Banner Saga for using the word 'saga' in its name. After weeks of negative media attention it dropped the suit.

Although King is at the top of the totem pole right now, mobile games rarely retain spotlight for more than a couple months. Games like Draw Something and Words With Friends propelled Zynga into the billions only to have it come crashing down in roaring flames within months. Given its volatility, King needs to be extremely careful with how it manages Candy Crush Saga and its growth.##2846|Chancellor George Osborne has appointed a respected female economist as a Bank of England deputy governor, ending four years of an all-male interest-rate setting committee.

The appointment of Nemat Shafik, a deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was one of three senior officials announced on Tuesday as part of a radical shakeup at the Bank under governor Mark Carney. Ben Broadbent, already on the monetary policy committee, will take over as a deputy governor from Charlie Bean when he retires this summer. City grandee Anthony Habgood becomes chairman of court at Threadneedle Street, managing the Bank's affairs other than monetary policy.

The appointment of Egyptian-born Shafik, who is also a British and US national, follows growing criticism of Osborne's failure to appoint a woman to the monetary policy committee. The nine-member committee, which meets monthly to set interest rates under the chairmanship of Carney, has been without a female member since Kate Barker left in May 2010.

Shafik's post is a new role at the Bank, deputy governor responsible for markets and banking. It means Carney now has four deputies. Her appointment, effective from August, comes as the Bank fights to shore up its credibility amid a worldwide probe into alleged rigging of foreign exchange markets. The 51-year-old was just 36 when she became the youngest ever vice president at the World Bank. In her new role at Threadneedle Street she will represent the Bank in meetings with other central banks, the IMF and other institutions and will sit on the BoE's financial policy committee and court of directors. From June she will take the place of Paul Fisher on the monetary policy committee when his term ends.

Carney, who is pushing through a shakeup of the Bank's structure, welcomed the three new appointments.

"With a diverse combination of skills and experience, these appointments result in a well-rounded senior management team at the Bank – one that will set the direction for an ambitious agenda of transformation for the institution and enable it to meet the challenges and opportunities it faces in maintaining monetary and financial stability," he said in a statement.

The Bank said that Shafik would be responsible for reshaping its operations and balance sheet, including "ensuring robust risk management practices". She will also help develop and implement "an eventual exit" from quantitative easing, whereby the Bank pumped billions in electronic cash into the flagging economy during the downturn.

Habgood, who is chairman of Whitbread, takes over as chair of the Bank's court of directors from David Lees, who leaves at the end of June.

As the new deputy governor for monetary policy, Broadbent will be responsible for the Bank's analysis of the UK and international economies that feeds into interest rate decisions. He takes on the post at a turning point in the cycle for borrowing costs. After five years at a record low of 0.5% interest rates are expected to start rising again in 2015, albeit gradually, as the economic recovery gathers steam.

Announcing the appointment, Osborne said: "I am delighted to announce the appointment of three such highly qualified and experienced people to join the Bank's already excellent executive team. Their impressive experience of business, economics and international finance will strengthen and diversify the Bank's top team and enable them to continue to face Britain's ongoing economic challenges from a position of strength".

In further changes, Spencer Dale, currently MPC member and Bank chief economist, will become executive director for financial stability, joining financial policy committee. He effectively swaps roles with Andy Haldane, currently executive director for financial stability, who becomes chief economist and joins the MPC.

Changes to the monetary policy committee will give market players plenty to think about as they seek to predict when the first move in interest rates will come.

David Tinsley, economist at BNP Paribas bank in London, said: "What does all this mean for the direction of policy? Well the truth is it is hard to know, but it certainly adds a degree of raised uncertainty as to how the debate on the MPC will go from the second half of this year, when most of the changes occur."

"In Paul Fisher's departure the MPC is clearly losing a 'dove'. But in Dale's move off the MPC it is also losing a 'hawk'. At the same time Nemat Shafik's views will be an unknown quantity for a while (she may hug the consensus until she feels more up to speed with the UK conjuncture). Andy Haldane has a reputation as a 'free thinker'. How this translates into his views on monetary policy are not clear."

16.55 That's all from us today. Have a great evening. See you tomorrow!

16.51 European markets have closed. The FTSE 100 finished up 0.62pc at 6,568.35, while the CAC 40 in Paris ended the day up 1.36pc at 4,273.59 and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt is up 1.4pc at 9,182.00. Russia's benchmark index closed up 3.7pc, while the PFTS index in Ukraine fell 5.2pc.

Heading into the close the FTSE 100 is up 42 points, as markets have finally decided that low equity valuations outweigh the worries over Crimea.

European markets have benefited from a relief rally following the selloff that preceded the weekend’s referendum in Crimea. Today’s comments from the EU and US, stating that they have imposed travel bans and asset-freezes on officials from Russia and Ukraine, feel very much like a shot across the bows rather than the punitive measures Ukraine's citizens would have hoped for.

16.07 Germany's big trade surpluses are here to stay, according to the governor of it central bank. Jens Wedimann told a conference in Kiel that introducing more competition into Germany's services sector would be helpful, but could not resolve the problems in the eurozone. He said:

By removing rigidities in the services sector, Germany might not only strengthen its growth potential, but could do so in a way that is likely to have a moderating impact on the current account as well.

Germany has been criticised for its large current account surplus, including the US. Last November, José Manuel Barroso, the head of the European Commission, said Brussels had launched an "in depth review" into whether Germany’s large current account surplus is harming the European economy.

Europe starts dialogue on reducing reliance on Russian energy

15.30 William Hague, the foreign secretary, has said the EU has begun discussing the need to reduce its reliance on Russian energy. He told Sky News:

We have started today discussing the longer term, the need to reduce European dependence on Russian energy over many years to come.

15.04 So what do the sanctions against Russia mean? Zoya Burbeza, a Solicitor at Zaiwalla & Co explains:

Today’s announcement by the EU to impose sanctions on 20 key people in Russia and Crimea, shows it has deemed the Crimean referendum illegal and as such will not endorse the result. The proposed measures include travel bans and asset freezes on those responsible for calling for and organizing Sunday's referendum. It is a strong political statement by European officials who have shown they are determined to punish Russia for its actions in Crimea.

The travel ban will mean that the individual is unable to travel to any of the 28 member countries of the EU, whilst the asset freeze will result in the suspending of the individual’s legally and beneficially owned assets within the EU. These initiatives are likely to have a great impact on these influential individuals, considering the connections many Russians have with the EU. Many Russian high net worth individuals opt to bank with Austrian and UK institutions and are heavily invested in a number of real estate markets across the Union .

These restrictive measures are a strong political statement, and demonstrate that the EU is targeting political individuals rather than commercial entities. If this proves to be an ineffective deterrent, it is likely we will see trade and financial restrictions come into place, the type of measures that are currently imposed on Iran.

Coventry Building Society appoints new interim chief

14.21 Coventry Building Society has appointed Colin Franklin as its interim chief executive.

Mr Franklin will replace David Stewart, who announced his intention to step down as chief executive last April. Mr Stewart is current managing director of Godiva Mortgages and Sales and Marketing Director at Coventry Building Society. A permanent replacement will be announced in due course.

Ian Pickering, Coventry BS chairman, said:

I am pleased to announce this appointment. Colin is a very experienced director and his long career at Coventry demonstrates his understanding of, and commitment to, the values that have guided the Society's success.

13.53 So who could be on this sanctions list? Peter Spiegel at the FT has a few ideas:

<noframe>Twitter: Peter Spiegel - US sanction targets: Yelena Mizulina; Leonid Slutsky; Andrei Klishas; Valentina Matviyenko; Dmitry Rogozin; Vladislav Surkov; Sergey Glazyev</noframe>

In case (like most of us) you're not aware who any of these people are, Mizulina is a Russian MP who has campaigned for curbs on gay rights, Slutsky is a Russian football coach, Klishas is former president of Norilsk Nickel and also an MP, Matviyenko is an MP and close ally of Putin, Rogozin is Russia's deputy PM in charge of defence, Surkov has been dubbed the current architect of the political system in Russia and Glazyev is a Russian MP.

13.24 The EU-Russia summit is still on, for now. Bruno Waterfield has more:

13.20 Not everyone thinks deflation is an imminent threat in the eurozone. Gizem Kara, senior European economist at BNP Paribas, writes:

In April, inflation should rebound. This will be mainly due to two reasons. First, seasonal price increases will kick in a month later than last year, as highlighted above. This will add around 0.1 percentage point (pp) to annual headline inflation rate according to our forecasts. Second, energy-related base effects should also ease the pace of decline in annual energy price inflation (we expect energy prices to remain flat in April, compared with a 1pc m/m fall in April last year). This alone will also add another 0.1pp to the headline rate, leaving the annual HICP inflation rate at around 0.8pc.

After this volatility in the very short term, we expect a slight moderation in inflation to 0.6pc in Q3, before it rebounds to around 0.9pc by end-2014.

12.55 More from Bruno on those Russia sanctions:

The names of the individuals who are subject to sanctions will be published overnight.

12.30 Europe's market watchdog is examining the foreign exchange market following allegations that some of its benchmarks may have been manipulated by banks.

Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority, which coordinates the application of EU securities rules across the 28-nation bloc, told Reuters:

We are looking at the sector and we are collecting data, but we have no direct powers regarding any enforcement issues ... it's clearly a national issue when it comes to enforcement.

The wide-ranging probe has involved several global banks, and there have even been allegations that the Bank of England knew about alleged manipulation, but did nothing.

11.47 More analysis of today's inflation data. Tom Rogers, senior economic adviser at EY, said:

Today’s inflation data illustrate that even the stronger performing economies are now witnessing much slower price growth than is consistent with the ECB’s mandate. We expect the Euro to weaken in the months ahead, as well as a gradual improvement in economic activity, helping nudge inflation back towards 2pc gradually. Nevertheless the slowing of prices in stronger economies gives the ECB more latitude to act, and as such it might be prudent for the ECB to strengthen its policy stance in the coming months as a precaution. A first step might be to be more explicit about what its recent forward guidance means for future interest rates.

Morrisons employee arrested in connection with data theft

11.31 A Morrisons staff member has been arrested following news last week that the salary and bank account details for 100,000 of its employees were stolen and published online.

A disc containing the data was sent to the Telegraph & Argus newspaper in Bradford, where the supermarket is based.

Morrisons said it was continuing to work with West Yorkshire Police on the investigation.

11.20 More on the sanctions from our man in Brussels, Bruno Waterfield:

11.15 Despite Crimea overwhelmingly voting in favour of joining the Russian Federation, raising the risk of Western sanctions against Russia, the FTSE 100 has gained 25 points to 6,553, a 0.4pc rise. Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at broker Interactive Investor, said:

With the anticipation of Russian sanctions from the West taking the limelight, many investors will be choosing to wait and see before they reinvest in equities. As investors prepare themselves for brinkmanship reminiscent of the Cold War there is understandably no sense of urgency as this story will no doubt drag on for quite some time.

That said, with 6,500 providing fairly decent support for the FTSE 100 while equities look technically oversold as gold sits at six month highs, the brave optimists among us will be looking to grab a bargain or two at current levels.

European leaders to agree sanctions against Russia

11.01 Foreign ministers have gathered this morning for a jaw-jaw on how to punish Russia. Sanctions on around 20 people will be agreed, with the possibility of adding further names to the list when EU leaders meet later in the week.

Those targeted in the first phase will include politicians responsible for calling for and organising Sunday's referendum in Crimea, according to Lubomir Zaoralek, foreign minister of the Czech Republic.

10.29 Commenting on the inflation data, Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said:

Uncomfortable and unwelcome news for the ECB as Eurozone consumer price inflation in February was revised down to 0.7, matching last October’s lowest level since November 2009. Furthermore, four countries are now reporting deflation (Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovakia) while inflation is only 0.1% in Spain and Ireland. Adding to the ECB’s problems, the euro is worryingly strong, hitting a 30-month high of USD1.396 last week.

The ECB currently holds the view that deflation risks across the Eurozone are “quite limited” to quote Mario Draghi, but it is concerned that the longer that Eurozone consumer price inflation remains down below 1.0%, the greater the risk of deflation becomes as consumers’ inflation expectations are likely to ratchet downwards.

Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (Photo: AP)

10.23 More than a quarter of the eurozone is in deflation, while half the bloc is repo rting current inflation rates of less than 0.5pc, according to official data.

Disinflationary pressures in the eurozone pushed down inflation to 0.7pc in February - matching its lowest ever level.

Eurostat revised down its estimate of price rises from a flash estimate of 0.8pc. It said petrol prices and heating oil were the biggest drags on inflation.

Vodafone shares rise after Ono deal announced

09.25 Shareholders like Vodafone's £6bn takeover of the Spanish cable operator Ono this morning. The company is up a touch over 1pc, despite suggestions it could damper AT&T's enthusiasm to buy it.

Here's what analysts at Jefferies have to say about it:

The clear positive from this morning, however, is that Vodafone is addressing a key strategic weakness proactively, delivering on management's commitment to be credible in fibre convergence in key markets on a 5-year view. There was some risk, in our view, that Vodafone might delay this acquisition (allowing Ono to IPO) mindful of AT&T's apparent reluctance to endorse the strategic necessity of building fibre convergence capability in European markets. Vodafone forecasts that, by September 2015, it will have leading high-speed broadband coverage in Spain (10.2m homes comprising Ono's 7.2m and the 3m [fibre] co-build with Orange).

Housebuilders jump on Osborne's Help to Buy announcement

09.00 Housebuilder shares have all rallied in the wake of the Chancellor's pledge to "build for Britain", with Persimmon up 6.1pc - the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, Bovis Homes 5.6pc higher, Taylor Wimpey up 4.8pc and Bellway 3.9pc higher.

Investors have sent the shares higher after Mr Osborne yesterday unveiled plans to build more than 120,000 homes, creating a garden city at Ebbsfleet in Kent, and extend the Help to Buy scheme until 2020.

Hague raise chilling prospect of new Cold War

08.35 William Hague has been speaking on the Today programme about the latest situation in Crimea, after 95% of voters supported joining Russia in a referendum.

Mr Hague said that using British military forces was not on the table:

We’re not looking at military options here, this is not about a Crimean war.

But the Foreign Secretary said that "I’m confident we will agree some sanctions today, some travel bans, some asset freezes" and "We will continue our effort to make a diplomatic breakthrough".

He added:

I would not describe it as a new Cold War, but that will depend on the course of events over the next few days

Company news: Just-Eat confirms float plans, Alibaba confirms listing

08.05 Here's today's company news from the City:

• Just-Eat, the online takeaway company, has confirmed plans to raise £100m with a listing on the London Stock Exchange. It says it had revenues of £96.8m last year, with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £14.1m.

• Smiths News, the newspaper and magazine distributor, says it will change its name to Connect Group, to reflect its diversification into books and other products.

• And Jupiter Fund Management says its incoming chief executive Maarten Slendebroek is starting work today.

• In China, the e-commerce giant Alibaba has confirmed plans to float in the US, raising up to $15bn.

Vodafone agrees £6bn Ono deal

07.55 Vodafone has announced a long-awaited acquisition of Ono, the Spanish internet and television provider.

The company will pay €7.2bn (£6bn) for the company, which has 1.9m customers in Spain.

Here's what Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao has to say:

The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone.

Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.

We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain.

Markets mixed after Crimea vote

07.40 It looks like the week is going to start with another turbulent day on the markets, with yesterday's referendum in Crimea raising the possibility of the West imposing heavy sanctions on Russia.

The referendum, denounced as "illegal and illegitimate by the West, saw 96.6pc of voters in favour of joining Moscow.

Traders are now waiting for what Europe and the US has to say about it, and what sanctions may be imposed.

However, it's a mixed story on the markets this morning:

• The FTSE 100 is expected to open slightly up

• The Nikkei in Japan has fallen 0.35pc

• And Moscow's Micex index has risen 1.6pc as investors decide Russian stocks are now cheap

The safe haven of gold hit a six-month high this morning of $1,392, meanwhile.

Good morning

07.00 Good morning and welcome to our daily business and markets live blog, your one stop shop for all the breaking business stories of the day.##2851|There was much excited or dismissive chatter about British mobile game titan King on Wednesday after the Candy Crush Saga maker announced its initial public offering and implied it was seeking a valuation at nearly $8 billion. Isn’t this crazy? Are we not in the middle of another nutty tulip mania?

Well, no. King is generating nearly $2 billion in annual sales. The IPO values the company at roughly four times annual sales. That is roughly Coca-Cola’s valuation. Coca-Cola sells mostly sugary drinks during a time when there is a strong and growing backlash against sugar. Coca-Cola’s sales are declining by about 4% year over year.

Why would it be nutty to value a highly profitable mobile game company that just delivered 1,000% sales growth at the same level as a beverage company with declining sales? Each King employee generates tens of millions of dollars in sales. Each Coca-Cola employee delivers $300,000 in sales. What’s nuttier?

Twitter is valued at over 20 times its annual revenue. Don’t even ask about the profitability of Twitter or Amazon — that is purely a hypothetical possibility that may not even happen in the future. King, meanwhile, made over a $500 million profit in 2013.

Of course, King is entirely too dependent on a single game. But that game has demonstrated an eerie ability to resist sales erosion. It’s still the No. 2 iPhone and iPad app in America and near the top of sales charts across the world. It is one of the very few apps that managed to crack the Japanese top 10 sales chart. It is one of the even fewer apps that has also had success in the supremely insular Korean market.

King has also shown the ability to churn out solid, leggy earners like Pet Rescue Saga and Farm Heroes Saga. Both are right now top 10 hits in the U.S. iOS revenue charts. Of course there are no guarantees that King can ever produce a mega blockbuster like Candy Crush again but there is a guarantee that King can produce three U.S. top 10 grossing apps simultaneously. The company is proving that right now, today.

Moreover, King has a highly sophisticated analytics system evaluating and processing its base of more than 300 million monthly active users. It can identify which of these players are paying, what they are paying for, when and how. It can aim marketing campaigns of novel games at them with pinpoint accuracy. It owns its customers far more intimately than traditional game vendors ever did.

What more can you ask of a game maker?##2852|Image copyright Reuters Image caption The tanker docked at Sidra without government permission

Libya's parliament has dismissed PM Ali Zeidan after a tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held port reportedly broke through a naval blockade.

MPs called a vote of confidence in Mr Zeidan after they were told the North Korean-flagged ship had escaped to sea.

Defence Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was named interim prime minister.

Earlier, Libyan officials had said they had "complete control" of the tanker as it tried to leave the port of Sidra. But the rebels rejected the assertion.

Analysis In the long-term, the debate is not really over whether Mr Zeidan's departure will help or make matters worse. That is because many people want to know if Libya's political players can set their differences aside long enough to allow any prime minister or government to rule the country effectively. There are deepening social, ideological, and regional fault-lines. The real power lies with the guns, and the guns are with competing militia brigades, some of whom have aligned themselves to opposing political parties and even to the ousted prime minister. If Libya's most pressing needs - disarmament, an effective army, and a consensus between political parties - are not dealt with, it ultimately will not make a difference who is in power. In recent months, there has been more public pressure on the General National Congress, who many want dissolved, than on the prime minister and his cabinet.

Separatist militants have occupied three major eastern ports since August.

They are seeking a greater share of the country's oil revenues, as well as autonomy for the historic eastern region of Cyrenaica.

'Bad weather'

The tanker - named Morning Glory - was reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude at Sidra's oil terminal.

It was the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held port since the separatist revolt against the central government in Tripoli erupted in July.

The government is still struggling to assert its authority over the armed groups and tribesmen who helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says Mr Zeidan's removal is likely to raise more concerns over the stability of Libya as it struggles to maintain control over large parts of the country.

Members of Libya's parliament, the General National Congress, said that bad weather had stopped the navy's ships from following the tanker into the Mediterranean from Sidra.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told al-Nabaa TV that the navy vessels had been forced to sail close to the coast.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

Analysts say it is unlikely the ship is owned or controlled by North Korea and it is probably sailing under a flag of convenience to keep its true ownership secret.

On Monday, the GNC ordered a special force to be deployed to "liberate" all rebel-held oil terminals. The operation is due to start within one week.

Libya's government has tried to curb protests at oil fields and ports, which have seen vital oil revenues plummet.

However, there has been little progress at the indirect talks between officials and Ibrahim Jathran, a former anti-Gaddafi militia leader and regional head of the Petroleum Facilities Guard who is now leading the protests.

His demands include the formation of an independent commission representing the three historic regions of Libya, which will supervise the sale of oil and ensure the country's east gets a greater share of revenues.

Libya's oil output has slowed to a trickle since the protests started in July last year, depriving the Opec producer of its main budget source.##2853|Sbarro says it's filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, marking the struggling pizza chain's second trip through bankruptcy court in less than three years.

The filing comes shortly after it closed 155 of its U.S. locations. It still has more than 800 locations worldwide.

Sbarro had also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain's image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn't take hold.

Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., says its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent.##2854|Winston-Salem, NC (27101)

Amazon has raised the price of its free-shipping and entertainment loyalty program Prime by $20 per year. That’s not much but it may cause up to 10 percent of current subscribers (more than two million) to cancel or not renew.

The cost of the innovative and highly successful program for Amazon users has been $79 per year. Now it’s going to be $99.

Amazon indicated it might boost prices by as much as $40 per year on its Q4 earnings call: “With the increased cost of fuel and transportation as well as the increased usage among Prime members we’re considering increasing the price of Prime between $20 to $40 in the U.S.”

The $20 price increase (as opposed to $40) must be based on member survey data about price sensitivity and confidence that at the $20 level the company can retain the majority of its current users.

February survey data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) estimates that Amazon currently has 27 million Prime members. This represents nearly half (45 percent) of Amazon customers, which seems too high to me.

CIRP also found that 67 percent of current Prime members are likely to renew at $99, while 6 percent probably will not. Just under 30 percent (27 percent) say they “probably will renew.” My hunch is that Prime may lose 10 percent of its current subscribers as a result of the price increase.

CIRP tested Prime member attitudes at different price levels to determine subscriber price sensitivity. At $119 the firm found that 40 percent would “definitely not renew their membership.”

If Amazon retains 90 percent of 27 million current Prime members (to use the CIRP figures) it would represent $2.4 billion in annualized revenue at the $99 price point. However Prime can’t be viewed as a stand-alone revenue stream. It has to be viewed in the context of loyalty and more frequent purchasing by members.

A previous CIRP survey found that Amazon Prime members spend more than twice as much per year than non-Prime members ($1,340 vs. $650 on average).##2860|Empty##2861|Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said there is a level of flexibility for the government's growth target at around 7.5 percent this year, stressing rather the importance of creating enough jobs.

"We are not preoccupied with GDP growth," Li stressed when asked on the lowest growth rate that the government can live with at a press conference following the conclusion of the annual legislative session.

"The growth that we want is one that brings real benefits to the people, helps raise the quality and efficiency of economic development, and contributes to energy conservation and environment protection," he said.

Li's elaboration came after the government announced last week that the country will target an unchanged growth of around 7.5 percent in 2014.

It also vowed to keep inflation at around 3.5 percent and create 10 million more urban jobs to ensure the registered urban unemployment rate does not rise above 4.6 percent.

At the conference, Li underscored the importance of a proper growth to deliver enough urban jobs while leaving room for the six to seven million migrant workers to seek employment in cities.

China's economy grew 7.7 percent last year, well above the government goal, but a set of data that pointed to softening manufacturing activity in recent months has renewed concerns on the growth outlook of the world's second largest economy.

In response to the concerns, Li emphasized that China's economy has "tremendous potential and resilience", and the country has the ability and conditions to keep its economic operation within a proper range.

The premier noted a spate of complex challenges for this year, including enhancing the quality and efficiency of economic development, tackling pollution and saving energy.

"So we need to strike a proper balance amidst all these goals and objectives. This is not going to be easy," Li acknowledged.

"We need to face up to the difficulties and challenges and make the most of the favorable conditions. This holds the secret of our success," he said, citing a Chinese proverb that "only a sharpened axe can cut through firewood."

Although China's 7.5 percent growth target is the same as previous years, its importance is fading as many believe the government will no longer view the figure as the necessary minimum as it usually did in the past.

Senior leaders and officials have on various occasions backed up the macro-economic control strategy featuring the idea of "a proper range," -- a lower limit to ensure steady growth and job creation and an upper limit to avert inflation, which was first proposed by Li in July.

Finance minister Lou Jiwei joined the chorus last Thursday, calling for more comprehensive understanding on the country's growth target instead of merely fixating on the 7.5-percent figure.

GDP growth, inflation and employment are all key factors that should be taken into consideration when assessing economic conditions, Lou told a press conference, adding that a growth of 7.3 percent or 7.2 percent can still be counted within that range.##2862|Empty##2863|##2864|Empty##2865|Police investigating the disappearance of Malaysian Airline Flight MH370 are undertaking enquiries into whether any passengers or crew on the plane were suffering personal or psychological problems.

The report comes as the first image of 53-year-old Malaysian Zaharie Ahmad Shah, pilot of the ill-fated flight, has emerged.

Investigators are said to be exploring all possibilities to explain the disappearance of the Boeing 777 including a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure and also the possibility that the pilot may have crashed the plane in a suicide bid.

Hugh Dunleavy, the commercial director of Malaysia Airlines, said the captain in charge of the flight was a seasoned pilot with an excellent flight record.

"There have been absolutely no implications that we are aware of that there was anything untoward in either his behaviour or attitude," he said.

"We have no reason to believe that there was anything, any actions, internally by the crew that caused the disappearance of this aircraft."

Dunleavy has also reacted with scepticism to reports by a South African woman named Jonit Roos, who claimed that the co-pilot of the missing plane, Farid Ab Hamid, had invited her and a female companion to sit in the cockpit during a flight in December 2011.

"Just getting into that area requires you to go through the secure doors that we have in the cabin all the time," he said.

"And not only would that have been unusual, but it also would have meant you'd have to walk by our cabin crew as well, and have the code to get through. So I'm dubious, but I'm going to let the authorities investigate and tell us what happened."

Dunleavy added that the airline will give $5,000 per passenger to cover hotel expenses of relatives of the missing.

While a Chinese satellite has captured images of floating debris, authorities are no closer to explaining what happened to the plane or the 239 people and crew on board.##2866|Toasted sandwich chain Quiznos filed for protection from bankruptcy last Friday.

Restaurant executives of the Denver-based chain said they are implementing a restructuring plan that will cut their debt by more than $400 million.

Of Quizno's 2,100 restaurants in the United States, only seven are not independently-owned and are operated by franchises. The company said that those who are will not be effected by the bankruptcy.

At one time, Quiznos used to be a top dog in the sub sandwich market, owning 5,000 stores and directly competing with Subway. Now, Subway has eclipsed its former rival, owning over 40,000 stores worldwide.

Quiznos is just the latest fast food chain that has fallen as a result of the recession. Just last week, pizza restaurant Sbarro also filed for protection from bankruptcy.

"It's a survival of the fittest," said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of food research firm Technomic Inc, as reported by the Chicago Tribune. "The market is not growing, or it's barely growing, so the weak players are getting weeded out."

Quiznos originally garnered a lot of attention with its quirky commercials and a higher-end menu. Promoting the concept of toasted subs, the sandwiches at Quiznos offered more exciting choices than the generic, albeit cheaper, Subway.

"Quiznos really came out of the box with a better sandwich concept with a higher price point, which means many of the franchisees went into more expensive locations," said Darren Tristano of Technomic.

In the long run, cheaper won out. As the recession hit, Subway capitalized with its $5 foot long campaign. Quiznos on the other hand was forced to lower prices on top of keeping up with costs of premium menu items and high rent locations.

"They expanded too fast, they had a weak franchisee network," Bob Goldin said. "Once the Paneras of the world came along, I think, many consumers thought that was a better quality price point. And Subway came in on the lower end and aggressively promoted themselves as fresh."

Quiznos CEO Stuart Manthis said that the company will now invest in the independently-owned franchises, lowering food prices and increasing local advertising.##2867|Empty##2868|Empty##2869|Empty##2870|Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, one of the world’s biggest Internet companies, said Sunday that it will go public on a U.S. stock exchange, a move analysts predict could raise up to $15 billion.



The announcement confirming plans for an IPO in the United States ended months of speculation over where the company would list its shares after talks for a Hong Kong stock sale fell apart last year.

Alibaba, based in Hangzhou, China, has said that more than $150 billion worth of merchandise changes hands on its online platforms each year, more than Amazon and eBay combined.

The company was founded in 1999 by former English teacher Jack Ma, whose 17 employees worked out of his apartment to link Chinese suppliers with retailers abroad. It grew into an online retail behemoth, with offices around the world and more than 20,000 employees, controlling around 80 percent of China’s e-commerce.

Alibaba doesn't report its finances. But Yahoo, which owns a 24 percent stake in the company, said Alibaba's revenue for the quarter ending in September rose 51 percent from a year earlier to reach $1.8 billion.

Analysts estimate Alibaba has a value of at least $140 billion, and the IPO proceeds could exceed $15 billion. Facebook's IPO in June 2012 raised $16 billion and at the time valued the company at more than $100 billion.

While the company didn’t offer any details about the timing or size of the IPO or on which exchange it would list its shares, sources told Reuters that Alibaba is planning the public offering in the third quarter of 2014.



Alibaba's decision to go to the U.S. is a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially the company's preferred venue for the IPO. The semiautonomous Chinese financial center's stock exchange refused to change its rules to accommodate the company's unusual management structure, in which it allows top executives owning 10 percent of the company to retain control of the board.

However, Alibaba hinted that the door has not completely shut on listing its stock in Hong Kong.

"Should circumstances permit in the future, we will be constructive toward extending our public status in the China capital market in order to share our growth with the people of China," the company said in a release.

The listing will be closely watched by Alibaba's two largest shareholders — Yahoo and Japan's Softbank Corporation, which controls 37 percent of the company. Yahoo initially invested in Alibaba in 2005, but has said it plans to trim its stake in the company through the IPO.

Alibaba is one of a number of Chinese Internet heavyweights planning to cash in with IPOs amid rapid growth. The announcement comes two days after Chinese Internet company Sina filed plans for a potential U.S. IPO for Weibo, its microblog unit. Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, indicated it plans to raise $500 million. Another Chinese online retailing giant, JD.com, filed in January for a U.S. stock listing.

Close##2873|Alibaba Group Holdings, a firm founded by Jack Ma from a one-room apartment 15 years ago, holds just over 45 percent market share in the Chinese online retail sector. After months of speculation, the Chinese business on Sunday announced plans for an initial public offering (IPO) on a US stock market. Alibaba did not say which US index it would seek to join, or what share of the company would go on offer.

Nevertheless, industry insiders have predicted that the IPO should be the largest for an Internet company since Facebook's flotation in 2012, perhaps even surpassing the $16 billion (11.5 billion euros) raised by Mark Zuckerberg's company.

Next stop for Jack Ma: Wall Street

Alibaba, based in Hangzhou, owns two of China's most popular online shopping services, Taobao and TMall. According to Chinese news agency Xinhua, their combined transaction value for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013 was $163 billion. That figure would exceed the volume of trade traffic going through US giants Amazon and Ebay combined.

The company had reportedly also considered Hong Kong and London before settling on hitting the markets on Wall Street.

Amazon's far-flung rival

Alibaba said in its statement that a future listing on the Hong Kong exchange would be considered "should circumstances permit." The company's decision was considered a blow for Hong Kong, which has not hosted an initial share sale worth more than $4 billion since October 2010.

Media reports in the US, including from business publication Bloomberg, suggested that six investment banks were in negotiations with the Chinese giant ahead of the IPO, including Deutsche Bank AG. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were also mentioned.

Japan's telecommunications giant Softbank owns a 37-percent share in Alibaba, while Yahoo in the US holds 24 percent. Yahoo was planning to reduce its share via the IPO, however.

The Chinese company has been praised for its "holistic multi-brand strategy," with experts pointing to savvy acquisitions like the company's major investment in the AutoNavi map services. Estimates suggest that one in four of China's growing legion of smartphone users have this navigation program, which Alibaba might use to offer strategic online sales for services like hotels and restaurants at peoples' destinations.

Microblogging site Weibo also plans IPO

Sina Weibo, named after the Chinese for "microblog," announced its plans for an IPO on Wall Street on Friday. The Chinese Twitter rival claims 280 million users, 60 million of whom are active on a daily basis. Just under half the total number of users are described as "active" in the company's official prospectus for the IPO.

Alibaba is Weibo's second-largest shareholder, holding an 18-percent stake.

Weibo plans to follow in Twitter's IPO footsteps

Twitter is blocked in China as part of Internet censorship, although the more technically adept can circumvent this. Weibo is also subject to censorship at times, especially if users seek to openly discuss sensitive political issues, but the site is accessible to all.

Twitter's initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in November 2013 raised more than $1.8 billion, even though the social media site was yet to post an annual profit prior to going public.

Although neither company name is liable to resonate very much among the US populace, investors on Wall Street and beyond are well aware of both their existence and potential, operating in one of the world's fastest-growing online marketplaces.

Estimated valuations for Alibaba range from around $50 billion to three times that figure, with a future IPO likely to provide a more precise ballpark.

Most Popular Destinations##2875|Hertz Corp.'s (HTZ) board has approved the plans of separation into two independent, publicly traded companies. The two companies would be "Hertz," comprised of the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly rental car businesses as well as Donlen, a provider of fleet leasing and management services, and "HERC," the Hertz Equipment Rental Corp.

The separation is intended to be in the form of a tax-free spin-off to Hertz shareholders, and the firm has received a Private Letter Ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, allowing Hertz to separate the businesses in a tax-efficient manner. The HERC separation is expected to be complete by early 2015.

Hertz would receive net cash proceeds from a HERC spin-off of around $2.5 billion, which would be used to pay down Hertz debt and support a newly approved $1 billion share buyback program. As part of this new repurchase program, the major shares are likely to be purchased following the separation of HERC. The buybacks might reach 20% of Hertz's outstanding shares, including the $1 billion already approved.

After the separation, Hertz hopes to maintain a target net corporate leverage ratio of between 2.5x to 3.5x net debt / EBITDA. Given Hertz's new target net corporate leverage ratio, the company said it may opportunistically look to return additional capital to shareholders on an ongoing basis.

Hertz' board anticipates that the planned separation of the equipment rental from the car rental business would create a stronger growth profile and more competitive position for each company; optimize the companies' capital structures based on the objectives of each independent company; allow each business to attract and retain personnel by offering equity-linked compensation; as well as create a more targeted investment opportunity with multiples and trading valuations that more accurately reflect the strengths and opportunities of each business.

Improving the technology around HBO Go is a top priority for 2014, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes told investors Tuesday at Deutsche Bank's Media, Internet and Telecom Conference.

Many HBO Go users were left in the dark Sunday night when they tried to watch the season finale of HBO's "True Detective." The number of people tuning in effectively crashed the network's video-on-demand platform, sparking a flood of angry tweets from those trying to log on.

Still, Mr. Bewkes said, "Most of you could" watch it.

On Sunday night, the "True Detective" finale at 9:00 p.m. ET averaged 3.5 million viewers, a series high and 50% more than the premiere audience of 2.3 million. Across the night's three telecasts, the series also hit a high note with 4.9 million viewers. HBO has not released numbers on how many people watched or tried to watch via HBO Go.

"We're investing in HBO Go," Mr. Bewkes said. "That's good news for those of you that tried to watch 'True Detective' last week."

"We've got a lot of demand," he added. "We want to make HBO Go stronger."

HBO Go allows HBO subscribers to watch original programming and movies across multiple devices, including tablets, mobile phones and Apple TV. A number of its users, however, are not actual HBO subscribers but instead use a friend or family member's password to sign in.

HBO CEO Richard Plepler has brushed aside this fact, telling BuzzFeed that the platform is partly a marketing vehicle for the network, which is "in the business of creating addicts." Turning a blind eye to HBO Go pirates, he added, "has no impact on the business."

On Tuesday, Mr. Bewkes spoke on a range of topics, from video on demand and HBO Go to the Turner networks including TruTV. "We want to move it a little bit more upscale," he said of the channel. "Not a lot, but a little."

Twenty-five percent of HBO's revenue comes from overseas, Mr. Bewkes added, with more than 80 million international subscribers for the network. "You'll see growth in that," he said. Turner Networks' overseas revenue is about 18% to 20%, he added.

Time Warner's fourth-quarter revenue rose 5% to $8.6 billion, the company said in January, topping analysts' expectations.

Mr. Bewkes on Tuesday discussed neither CNN's ongoing makeover nor the company's plan to spin off the struggling magazine division Time Inc. into a separate public company. That separation is slated for the second quarter of this year.

The company plans to keep the Time Warner name even after jettisoning Time Inc., where the whole company began. But continuing to share a name with an earlier spin-off, Time Warner Cable, sometimes isn't the greatest, Mr. Bewkes allowed. "It would be good," he said, "if those Time Warner Cable trucks didn't say Time Warner, because people are calling me."##2885|Colorado Raises $2.1 Million in Recreational Marijuana Taxes

DENVER, CO — The tax figures are in, and in the first month of recreational pot sales, Colorado pulled in $2.1 million in tax revenue and fees, plus an additional $1.4 million from medical marijuana.

Figures published by the state Department of Revenue show $14 million worth of pot was sold in January, the first month Colorado’s first-in-the-nation law legalizing marijuana for recreational use was in effect.

“This is revenue directly out of the hands of cartels,” said Brian Vicente, who helped pass the law. “These tax numbers will probably grow over time, but since it’s a new market, will have to wait and see.”

Article continues after ad Advertisement

January’s numbers were skewed downward, thanks to the small number of stores ready to do business on day one, but skewed up as customers rushed to be among the first to buy their weed legally.

The office of Gov. John Hickenlooper predicted total taxes and fees would exceed $35 million by June and $188 million in the fiscal year beginning July.

The law, passed by voters in November, requires the first $40 million raised to go to school construction and improvement.

The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.

The maker of the popular game “Candy Crush Saga” has picked $7.6 billion out of the thin air for its initial public offering. King Digital Entertainment uses creative metrics to justify its whopping valuation. But there’s no way to calculate what an enterprise is worth when its profit can skyrocket 70-fold one year and could collapse the next. Rival Zynga’s IPO flub serves as an apposite warning.

King’s performance in 2013 was certainly impressive. Revenue climbed more than 11-fold, which means the company enjoyed astounding operating leverage. Moreover, the firm throws off boatloads of cash – $580 million from operations last year. Its backers have only had to put in $9 million of capital to date. No wonder they now fancy taking the company public.

The trouble is, the methods they’re using to value the company aren’t particularly helpful. Metrics like monthly gross average bookings per paying user (MGABPPU) and gross average booking per user (GABPU) shed little if any light for prospective investors.

Social gaming as a business is driven by hit products. Zynga’s travails show how hard it is to stay on top. Its shares have lost about half their value since their opening-day high in 2011 as the popularity of games like “FarmVille” faded. Heavy spending to buy rivals hasn’t worked either. Zynga spent $200 million on OMGPop and closed the business about a year later.

Sure, King looks cheaper – at the top of the range it would be worth about four times last year’s revenue, compared with five times for Zynga. But such comparisons may not be solid. “Candy Crush Saga” generated close to 80 percent of King’s bookings in the fourth quarter. There are already signs its peak may have passed. Instead of its customary explosive growth, fourth-quarter revenue was 3 percent lower than the third quarter. King needs a new hit, if not several, soon.

The company makes much of its “unique, repeatable, scalable” system of developing and distributing new games. There’s some truth to that – the company has been cash flow positive for nine years. So it can probably trundle along for a while even if it can’t develop a new hit when its current one fades. That’s hardly a basis for such a lofty IPO valuation.##2887|Bloomberg Chiquita Brands International Inc. bananas are displayed for sale at Union Street Produce Co. in San Francisco, California.

Chiquita bananas are grown in the banana belt. They’re shipped to the temperate belt. And the taxes on this enterprise will be paid in – Ireland?

Chiquita Brands International. Inc. , with headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., is already one of the world’s top banana distributors. It announced Monday it is buying Irish-based Fyffes, another global kingpin in the fruit distribution business, in a $1.07 billion, all-stock deal. The deal creates the world’s biggest banana business, with sales of about $4.6 billion.

By joining forces, the combined ChiquitaFyffes claims it will knock down operating costs by about $40 million a year.

But the move also knocks down Chiquita’s taxes, since it’s hitching itself to a company domiciled in Dublin.

Ireland isn’t exactly a tax shelter, but it’s close. Companies based there pay a 12.5% corporate tax rate compared with the (official) rate of up to 35% in the United States.

Several U.S. companies have already figured out the Ireland advantage. Drug maker Perrigo offshored itself to Ireland last year when it bought its Irish rival Elan Corp. (ELN). Industrial parts manufacturer Eaton Corp. is another one. It made the move in 2012 when it bought Ireland’s Cooper Industries Plc. It’s also why Apple Inc. maintains a network of unlimited Irish entities to avoid higher corporate taxes on billions of dollars of revenue it earns abroad. (Read more about it in this article in the Irish Times.)

In 2012, Chiquita’s income taxes resulted in a net expense of $105 million, reversing a net tax benefit the year before of $82 million. Much of the reversal had to do with establishing valuation allowances against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. It’s complicated stuff. But the company was clearly not pleased with the outcome, and said so in its annual report. So moving its corporate accounts to Ireland might actually simplify the taxation process as well as lighten the burden.

With operations in over 70 countries, Chiquita is no stranger to doing business abroad. The only problem it might have with its new Dublin address is convincing international regulators that the deal with Fyffes doesn’t put too many of the world’s bananas in the hands of one company.

Dan Schmerin is investment research director at Fairholme Capital Management, which owns more than 150 million common and preferred shares in Fannie and Freddie, and spoke to MarketWatch about the firms’ future.

Fairholme proposed a private recapitalization of Fannie and Freddie, but the Obama administration signaled that the plan was a no-go. Fairholme is also suing over a 2012 amendment to the government’s bailout agreement for Fannie and Freddie that forces the housing-finance giants to send all of their profits to the U.S. Treasury Department.

Fannie and Freddie’s futures remain unclear. U.S. lawmakers disagree over the role that the government should play in the U.S. housing-finance system. Also, with the recovery of the housing market, Fannie and Freddie have become cash cows, and some say the will to advance meaningful legislation is dimming.

Supported by political and legal hopes, investors have traded up Fannie FNMA, +0.70% and Freddie’s FMCC, +0.00% common shares more than 1,500% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the most heavily traded preferred shares of Fannie FNMAS, +7.36% and Freddie FMCKJ, +10.31% have each increased more than 500%.

This transcript has been edited for clarity and length.

MarketWatch: A U.S. Treasury official recently said Congress’s lack of progress on reforming the U.S. housing-finance system shouldn’t be “an excuse” to delay rebuilding the market for private-label mortgage securities. Has the administration given up on housing-finance reform?

Dan Schmerin, Fairholme’s director of investment research

Schmerin: It’s not entirely clear to us what the administration’s plan or strategy is with respect to reforming the GSEs. Aside from publishing a white paper in 2011, their thoughts, recommendations and viewpoints on GSE reform have really been few and far between. The president recently articulated, as you know, a few very high-level guiding principles, which are subject to significant interpretation and also subject to immediate disagreement from leaders within his own party.

MarketWatch: What does the lack of certainty and progress mean?

Schmerin: There is a growing recognition of the vital role that Fannie and Freddie play in our secondary mortgage market and the tremendous difficulties that our nation would face if one were to effectively abolish Fannie and Freddie with the hope of rebuilding other firms or a consortium of others firms to try and fill the void.

Our sense is that as more and more elected officials are examining the complexities inherent to this topic, they’ve realized that broad and sweeping reform, which may sound attractive, is actually very challenging to effectuate because the risks of getting it wrong are significant.

If you do away with Fannie and Freddie, congressional officials need to come forward and say: ‘We’re OK with doing away with affordable mortgages. We’re OK doing away with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and we believe our constituents will accept and understand that the availability and liquidity in the secondary mortgage market will be fundamentally different to their detriment going forward.’ Because those are the facts.

MarketWatch: Would it be such a bad thing if 30-year mortgages weren’t such a large share of the U.S. market?

Schmerin: An overwhelming majority of Americans demand the 30-year fixed rate. An overwhelming majority of Americans want the financial certainty that comes with fixed-rate payments and slow amortization over the lifetime of that mortgage.

We can certainly transition to a system that’s strictly adjustable-rate mortgages, but it’s not our sense that that is in the national interest.

Americans want, on a per capita basis, the highest quality homes, the largest availability of homes and, in terms of size, the largest square-footage homes. For all the perceived ills with our housing-finance system, we are all lucky in that in America we’ve achieved most of those objectives. That’s not to say that there aren’t high quality homes in other developed countries around the world. But they’re not as large, they’re not as easily available, on a per-capita basis, and most of them, frankly, aren’t as nice.

MarketWatch: Under what circumstances will Fairholme throw in the towel and sell its GSE stake?

Schmerin: I really couldn’t comment on that. I’m not the portfolio manager. I can also tell you that I don’t think that’s been contemplated.

MarketWatch: What’s the biggest misconception that Americans have about Fannie and Freddie stock?

Schmerin: There is a large gap in perception where many Americans believe these companies have been nationalized. Many Americans aren’t aware that there are private investors, shareholders, who still have a stake for 20.1% of the common equity and $33-plus billion of preferred stock.

These are not federal agencies and they are not wards of the state. They just happen to be unusual because of the charter that they have, the congressional charter, and some of the public mission element that was built into that charter. But at their core they are corporations.

MarketWatch: What does the White House not understand about the benefits of accepting a proposal like Fairholme’s?

Schmerin: We haven’t received a response from anyone in the government regarding our proposal or any other of the numerous proposals that are out there. So I’m not quite sure what to tell you other than we thought carefully about the prospects for reform and took into account some of the leading legislative proposals, took into account our sense of what private market participants would be willing to do and put forth one idea for how to transition going forward.

It was just one idea. There are many others, and to the extent that people have better ideas, we’d love to hear them.

It sounds like the administration has been having some private conversations with members of Congress, but we have yet to understand where that’s heading…The process has been very opaque.

MarketWatch: Would Fairholme be willing to negotiate with the government over its suit? And if so, what would the minimum settlement be?

Schmerin: I don’t think we’ve contemplated a minimum amount, per se. I think that’s really not the focus of our attention. We are open and optimistic that a consensual solution can be reached. It’s in the interest of the country. It’s in the interest of all taxpayers.

We are first and foremost taxpayers. The vast majority of our shareholders are taxpayers. The vast majority of owners of Fannie and Freddie are American taxpayers. So when we talk about who ought to see the benefits and the proceeds and the profits of Fannie and Freddie – taxpayers or shareholders -- we see that as a difference without a distinction.

MarketWatch: Is there anything you’d like to add?

Schmerin: The government has claimed in its responses…that imposing the net worth sweep was necessary because there was purported concern in the agency debt market about extinguishing the Treasury commitment to Fannie and Freddie as a result of this so-called mandatory 10% cash dividend obligation.

What that overlooks is the fact that in the preferred stock certificates, both Fannie and Freddie, if the board of directors did not declare a 10% cash dividend to Treasury, could simply pay a 12% stock dividend in lieu of that cash dividend.

We think that’s a really important point. It’s conspicuously absent from any of the explanations, justifications, memoranda, anything else that’s been produced to date in the administrative record.

MarketWatch: Is the 12% stock dividend going to be something that Fairholme emphasizes going forward in the litigation?

Schmerin: It’s a point that we are going to emphasize in multiple venues because we believe it’s a very important issue.

As Bruce [Berkowitz, Fairholme’s founder] said publicly, we actually think that that fact alone largely collapses the Justice Department’s case. We didn’t know it six months ago, but we know it now since they have responded to our complaints. And they have articulated that their primary justification for imposing the illegal net worth sweep was this concern around the ability of each company to continue paying the 10% cash dividend.

With each next step we have more unanswered questions than anything else. If I learned one thing from my time in Washington (I spent eight years there), it’s really not the initial action that causes as much consternation and upheaval as the potential cover up.

30-year mortgage rate falls##2892|March 14 (Reuters) - Sandwich chain Quiznos Corp filed for pre-packaged bankruptcy protection on Friday after struggling for years with high debt and rising competition.

The chain, known for pioneering the concept of toasted subs, said the restructuring would cut its debt by more than $400 million. It listed liabilities of between $500 million and $1 billion in its bankruptcy petition.

All except seven of its nearly 2,100 restaurants are independently owned and operated by franchisees and will not be affected by the bankruptcy, the company said in a statement.

“Our business plan includes several key elements aimed at supporting our franchisees, including reducing food costs, implementing a franchise owner rebate program,” Quiznos Chief Executive Stuart Mathis said.

The company has received $15 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its senior lenders in order to keep functioning during its restructuring period.

Quiznos has been facing stiff competition from its biggest rival Subway, one of the largest fast-food chain in the world with over 41,000 franchised stores in about 100 countries.

The company also faces competition from newer entrants such as Potbelly Corp, whose low-priced menus have appealed to consumers in a tough economy.

Struggling pizza chain Sbarro LLC also filed for its second bankruptcy in three years earlier this week, after struggling with fewer customers in malls that house many of its restaurants.

A pre-packaged bankruptcy is when an entity negotiates a deal with creditors and other interested parties in advance and presents that to a bankruptcy court judge. Pre-packaged plans greatly reduce uncertainty and legal fees.

The case is In re: The Quiznos Global LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No.14-10557.##2893|Empty##2894|Why did this happen?

The Libyan government ordered its armed forces to fire upon an oil tanker that was docking at a port in rebel-controlled territory. The North Korean ship arrived at Libya's largest oil-export terminal Es Sider, in an attempt to purchase oil from Libyan rebels. Libya has been engulfed in a political crisis between its weak central government and rebel militias, which has slowed oil exports to a trickle. Oil production is down to 235,000 barrels per day compared to the 1.4 million bpd in mid-2013.

Rebel militias in control of key ports hoped to illegally sell oil to a North Korean ship. The Libyan government ordered the armed forces to fire upon the ship, but the military refused, citing concern over safety of civilians and the desire to avoid an environmental disaster. Still, the government has promised to blow up the ship if it tries to follow through with oil exports.

Libya's central government has struggled to consolidate power in the country after being torn apart during its revolution. Militias that battled Muammar Gaddafi have refused to submit to the central government. Some have declared their own independence from Tripoli. Exporting oil would be a big step for them and a major blow to the central government. In an effort to prevent breakaway territories from exporting oil, the government has promised to bomb any ships seeking to export oil from such areas. The Libyan navy fired upon a ship from Malta in January that attempted to load oil in Es Sider.

The U.S. government expressed support for the Libyan government and stated that any illegal exports not sanctioned by Libya's National Oil Corporation amounted to "theft" from the Libyan people. The oil belongs to a joint venture run by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil, and Hess Corporation.

Twitter is rife with weird hashtag holidays that attempt to fill the non-holidays of the year with something special, and just as popular are “legit” holidays like Christmas and Mother’s Day.

There is, however, a right and a wrong way to do it. Most brands do it the wrong (boring) way, though inoffensively; some mess up badly enough that it trends for all the wrong reasons.

The goal of a holiday post is to score some points with an audience that is already primed to celebrate. This isn’t hard to do. A simple graphic with a festive greeting is usually enough to garner some engagement. But the memorable campaigns are the ones that approach holidays with an air of authenticity.

Here are a few tips on keeping it real.

Get Personal

Part of the reason to have a branded social account in the first place is to connect with your audience in a more personal way. Showing the people behind the company name is one of the most effective ways to do that. This boutique digital marketing agency in Ontario used the tactic to crowdsource a Father’s Day campaign to good effect; it highlights a few personal stories without hijacking or altering the meaning behind the holiday.

Get Creative

Every brand on the face of the planet seems to have a generic holiday greeting graphic at the ready. While eye-catching in isolation, these pictures quickly become repetitive when dropped in a sea of similar posts. They also come off as impersonal and inauthentic.

Brands can stand out from the crowd by differentiating themselves. Instead of a plain graphic, why not share photos from a company event celebrating the holiday? Or a quick video message? Or a themed Spotify playlist with your employees’ favourite holiday tunes? These don’t take much more effort than a graphic, but they make a bigger (and realer) impression.

Get Choosy

Every brand doesn’t have to recognize every single holiday on the map. If your company doesn’t have a clear reason to call it out (because it’s important to you or your audience), it’s fine to sit this one out. This will make the holidays you do celebrate on social more meaningful.##2901|Empty##2902|Copyright 2018 Zacks Investment Research

Calm Before the Storm for Gold Prices?

Today's Spotlight Market

Large speculators have been in a bullish mindset of late after adding to their overall net-long positions in Gold the past week. The most recent Commitment of Traders report shows non-commercial traders adding over 6,000 net-long positions during the week ending March 4th. On the other side of the trade were small speculators, who were reported to have liquidated just over 2,800 net-long positions, as well as commercial traders, who increased their overall short position by over 3,200 contracts during this time period.

Fundamentals

Following a price move below 1200.00 to start the year, front month Gold futures have staged a quiet recovery, rallying over $150 per ounce since January. With prices now hovering near 4-month highs, we have seen prices begin to consolidate within a $35 per ounce price band the past 2 weeks as neither bulls nor bears seems to have gained the upper hand at the moment.

Among the top concerns being voiced by Gold traders is the apparent sluggishness in the Chinese economy, which was highlighted by a surprising decline in Chinese exports which fell by 18% in February. Slower growth levels may force analysts to lower their estimates for Chinese commodity demand in the coming months, which can be viewed as a negative for Gold prices. China is believed to be the 3rd largest holder of Gold with an estimated reserve of 2,710 metric tons. Aggressive Chinese Gold purchases the past 5 years had some analysts looking for China to eventually hold as much Gold as that of the U.S., currently at 8,133.5 metric tons. But the timing of additional Chinese purchases remains unknown and it could take decades for the world’s most populous nation to accumulate that much of the yellow metal.

On the positive side for Gold prices, traders note some increased interest in Gold as a “safe haven” investment of late, as heightened geopolitical risks have emerged in Eastern Europe with Russian troops having occupied the Crimean region of Ukraine following the ouster of the nation’s President Viktor Yanukovych. This has led to calls by some political leaders for economic sanctions against Russia, which if implemented, could result in some sort of retaliation by Russia against western nations and potentially heighten global tensions which could trigger a flight back towards Gold by nervous investors.





Technical Notes - View Today's Chart

Looking at the daily continuation chart for Gold futures, we notice the bullish price move off the January lows has taken a bit of breather following a rally of over $150 per ounce. Prices have consolidated just above both the 20 and 200-day moving average although the 14-day moving average has moved out of overbought territory with a current reading of 62.00.

On a longer-term view, there appears to be a “double-bottom” formation on the daily chart going back to the July 2013 low. This could be a sign that a major bottom is in place but we would need to see a close above the intermediate high of 1428.00 to further validate this bullish chart formation. Near-term support is seen at 1317.40, with resistance found at 1355.00.

The combined company's board of directors will reflect an equal combination of directors from both companies and one mutually agreed upon director.

"This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders and offer immediate benefits for customers and consumers worldwide," Lonergan said in a press release. "This is a natural strategic partnership that combines two complementary companies of long history and great reputations that have built upon an unwavering commitment to exceed our customers' expectations. We will maintain our brands, all of which are valued by both customers and consumers. The combined company will also be able to provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice. We know Fyffes well, and our shared heritage will help to ensure a smooth integration as we work to bring best practices across geographies and business units to achieve substantial operating efficiencies."

"This deal will be transformative and offer exciting opportunities for the new business,” McCann said in the release. “We are looking forward to working with the Chiquita team to build a combined company that is well positioned to succeed in our highly competitive marketplace and which will create significant value for our shareholders. Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business that offers opportunities for growth.

Overall public transportation use grew 1.1% in 2013, and is up 37.2% from 1995 when transportation use outpaced population growth in the U.S., according to new data from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Last year was the eighth year in a row that over 10 billion trips were taken on public transportation across America. There were even more trips than in 2008 when gas prices rose to $4-$5 a gallon, and more Americans were opting out of driving, USA Today reports.

The APTA says economic recovery is a predominant reason for more transit rides, since public transportation use increases when more people have jobs. The APTA reports that about 60% of trips taken last year were people commuting to work.

Guinness World Records, which announced the policy, said it is the largest ever issued.

Neither the record keeper nor the issuer would say who is covered by the massive policy.

Dovi Frances, the adviser who arranged the policy, would only say it went to a well-known technology billionaire from California.

The wealthiest of the wealthy buy life insurance for several reasons.

Primary among them are tax purposes, Frances explained.

A wealthy estate is hit with a hefty tax bill, and there may not be enough cash to cover it, since many millionaires and billionaires hold their wealth in investments, he said.

The $201 million policy is more complicated than most. It's underwritten by 19 different insurance companies, each with a slice of less than $20 million, he said. If a single lender took the whole policy, Frances said, "they would go into bankruptcy if the insurance policy is called."

And a big plan comes with a big cost. Frances said the price is "in the low single-digit millions."##2921|THE governor of the Bank of England pledged to MPs today that the Bank would “ruthlessly” inquire into what officials knew about alleged rigging of currency rates by forex traders.

Mark Carney’s appearance before the Treasury Select Committee follows the suspension earlier this month of an unidentified Bank employee.

The central bank has said that so far there is no evidence that its staff colluded, participated or condoned unacceptable activity.

The governor said he was not pre-judging any inquiry into the individual,and that suspension was not in itself a disciplinary action. But he said: “We will ruthlessly, relentlessly follow through the investigation of what happened.”

It is believed the inquiry by independent legal counsel will focus on whether BoE officials were aware of the alleged rigging of currency rates, even if they did not collude in such manipulation or share confidential information.

“It’s imperative that we look at all aspects of this situation, and we re-confirm the integrity, probity, prudence and dedication of ongoing employees of the Bank of England,” Carney added.##2922|Taking out the often-volatile food and energy costs, prices rose 0.1% in February.

In London, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has started its own probe. The Bank of England (BoE) has also come under scrutiny for allegedly condoning the way currency traders at different banks shared information with each other at meetings with the senior bankers.

Communications between traders are a key part of several regulatory probes across the world into suspected currency market manipulation. The BoE denied ever condoning activity that was against the rules.

The BoE has suspended one official and revealed it stopped meeting a group of top London currency dealers in February 2013 amid an internal review.

"The BoE does not condone any form of market manipulation in any context whatsoever," said the central bank.

"The Bank has today reiterated its guidance to staff regarding management of records and escalation of important information."

It added that the internal review has not found any evidence that BoE staff colluded in any such manipulation or shared confidential client information.

The world’s biggest automaker said the move will see the lockout of about 6,400 employees at the factories in southern India.

Company and union officials had been trying to sign a new contract for the past 10 months, with the local government helping mediate negotiations.

“In the meantime, under the instigation of the union, certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days,” Toyota said in a statement.

“All these unlawful activities have been detailed in the lockout notice. With this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel,” it added.

A Tokyo-based company spokesman said Toyota hoped to restart production quickly, but could not give a timeline for any reopening of the plants, which make a range of models including the flagship Camry sedan, the Corolla and the Prius hybrid.

The two plants, near the city of Bangalore, produce about 310,000 units annually, Toyota said.

* Agence France-Presse##2929|Bank of England members have debunked claims the central bank knew about traders seeking to rig key foreign exchange rates for the past eight years.

Speaking at a Treasury Select Committee hearing, BoE's Paul Fisher said that there is "no evidence" of FX fixing despite allegations that the central bank new about allegations for years.

Fisher added that he has not even personally heard of currency rigging allegations until 2013 and would have told the regulator about it, if he had.

BoE governor Mark Carney added that "we first became aware ... a member of the bank first became aware of allegations related to (issues) we were discussing on the 16th of October, I was informed then, I informed the chair of court that day, we convened governors, we decided to launch an investigation within 48 hours we retained external council and they had begun a very thorough, systematic, relentless investigation."

"Best practice would appear, to discharge this type of rule, would be to have external expertise, not just legal expertise but an external person to run these types of reviews, and also to run the reviews of the bank's policy functions."

He added also reiterated that "this has taken a comprehensive, consistent, relentless approach to evidence, both obvious and not obvious."

Previously, IBTimes UK exclusively revealed that a whistleblower alerted regulators in the US, UK and Switzerland in 2011 about some of the world's largest trading companies and banks manipulating benchmark sterling, US dollar and Swiss franc currency rates.

However, it was not until 2013 that these authorities started investigating the allegations of market rigging.

BoE's Alleged FX Fixing Involvement

A few days ago, the BoE revealed that it suspended one official and confirmed that it stopped meeting a group of top London currency dealers last February following its internal review into allegations that it is involved in the foreign exchange fixing scandal.

In a statement, the BoE revealed that during its internal review into allegations that BoE officials condoned or were informed of manipulation in the FX market or the sharing of confidential client information, it suspended a member of staff, pending further investigation.

In a separate statement to IBTimes UK, a BoE spokesperson confirmed that the last meeting between central bank officials and the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee's chief dealers subgroup (CDSG), took place in February 2013.

Rumours surfaced four months later.

The CDSG consists of London's top FX dealers and is usually chaired by the BoE's chief dealer Martin Mallett. These meetings have existed since 2005 up to four times a year.

At the beginning of this month, BoE officials were accused of giving currency traders the green light over the way they shared customer orders with counterparts at other firms, when they met the central bank's seniors in 2012.

According to documents handed over to the regulator, BoE officials condoned the trading practices, which have now become a central part of the global foreign exchange manipulation investigations.

In January, a Freedom of Information Act request revealed that Bank of England officials discussed the foreign exchange setting process with chief currency dealers a year before any investigations were launched.

According to the documents, the FX setting was discussed with senior traders at some of the world's largest investment banks in April 2012, despite US, UK and European regulators launching their probes a year later.##2930|##2931|Investors will be keeping a close tab on Ukraine and China this week before turning their attention to the Federal Reserve.

Turmoil in Ukraine over the Crimean referendum could lead to more volatility in the markets.

Preliminary results showed the region voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to join Russia. The situation is causing growing tensions between the West and Moscow. The threat of sanctions and other action from the West against Russia means the crisis could further rattle investors as they worry about potential trade and energy disruptions.

Russia has paid a heavy price for the standoff so far. Its stock market and currency both tumbled since the unrest began. But it's not clear if Russia will back down.

"The logic now is that Russia is bracing for the next round of sanctions," said Brown Brothers Harriman analysts in a note Friday.

Related: Fallout of a 'yes' vote in Crimea

China could also weigh on market sentiment, as weak reports on the pace of growth in the world's second biggest economy put pressure on stocks last week. Japan's Nikkei suffered heavy losses last week, as investors sought safety in Japan's yen. Japanese stocks typically do better at times when the yen is weak.

Yellen's first press conference: Investors will focus on the Fed Wednesday. Janet Yellen is presiding over her first policy meeting at the helm of the central bank.

Afterward, she'll give a press conference updating the Fed's economic forecasts. The Fed said last month that it was still too early to tell what, if any, effects this winter's unusually harsh weather had on the economy. But a better-than-expected February jobs report supported the notion that the economy is sustaining its momentum.

Many economists expect Yellen to continue scaling back, or tapering, the Fed's stimulus program. The Fed is currently buying $65 billion of bonds each month to help keep interest rates low. It cut the size of its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion at its last two meetings and most expect another reduction of $10 billion to be announced Wednesday.

Investors will also be looking for clues as to when the Fed may raise interest rates. Though the central bank has maintained that it plans to keep its federal funds rate near zero for some time, minutes from its January meeting showed some internal debate about whether rates should be raised sooner rather than later.

And with the unemployment rate at 6.7%, many strategists think the Fed will officially abandon its previously-stated goal to raise rates once the unemployment rate hits 6.5%. It's possible that the Fed could set a lower threshold for unemployment.

Related: Yellen: 'Too many Americans remain unemployed'

But the Fed has a dual mandate to control inflation along with keeping unemployment low, so the Fed could also choose to focus even more on inflation targets as a gauge for interest rate adjustments.

To that end, the government will release key data on inflation -- the Consumer Price Index -- on Tuesday. In recent years, inflation has remained relatively low, held down by the Fed's interest rate policies and stagnant wages.

Banks too stressed? On Thursday, the Fed will release the results of its latest round of stress tests on the nation's biggest banks. The tests, introduced after the financial crisis, are designed to determine which banks have enough capital to weather catastrophic economic scenarios. Critics have charged that the tests do not go far enough.

Investors will be keeping an eye on the nation's largest institutions, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C), to see how they hold up against the Fed's requirements. Some regional banks will also be the spotlight.

In other corporate news, the earnings calendar isn't too crowded this week. But some big names are set to report results. Software company Oracle (ORCL) will report after the closing bell Tuesday, followed by shipping giant and economic bellwether FedEx (FDX) on Wednesday. Nike (NKE), a member of the Dow, will release earnings Thursday. Its report could shed more light on consumer spending trends around the world.##2932|Empty##2933|Last week MSNBC's Abby Huntsman expressed some strong opinions about Social Security. That's her right and her privilege. Unfortunately, she also made some inaccurate and misleading statements. (See Michael Hiltzik in the Los Angeles Times for details.)

As the saying goes, we are entitled to our own opinions but not to our own facts. We have written this open letter in order to ask for a correction.

Dear Abby:

We're writing you as members of two different generations -- Boomer and Millennial -- to ask you for an on-air correction to your recent segment on "The Cycle" focused on millennial and earned benefit programs. It was frustrating to see you unquestioningly repeat so many misleading talking points about one of our nation's most successful programs: Social Security.

Even more importantly, it was disappointing to see you repeat the phony claim that there is a "generational war" between the young and the old. The real "war" in this country is between the haves and the have-nots, and it's no secret who's winning that one. In fact, this notion of a "generational war" was dreamed up in the think tanks and PR firms of billionaires, so that credulous journalists, politicians, and yes, news anchors, would pick it up and repeat it endlessly.

Mission accomplished: many of them have. Fortunately, you have a great platform for correcting the record. Here's where you can start:

During your discussion of Social Security, you claimed that we need to increase the retirement age -- by as much as 10 years -- because life expectancies are about 20 years longer than they were in 1935. But when you factor out the large number of Americans who died young (often of childhood diseases) in the 1930s, and only take into account life expectancy after 65, our lives have been extended only by an average of about six years -- and these gains have disproportionately gone to wealthier Americans.

Currently, the "full retirement" age is 66 (it is gradually being raised to 67), but 41 percent of men and 46 percent of women take Social Security at 62, the earliest possible age. Starting Social Security at 62 means that their monthly benefits will be smaller for the rest of their lives, but millions of Americans have no other choice. They have health problems and cannot continue to work at physically demanding jobs, or they are unable to find employment due to age discrimination and the stagnant economy. Raising the retirement age is a Social Security benefit cut. If we increased it to 75, as you advocate, most people would still take Social Security much earlier and end up with drastically reduced lifetime benefits.

You maintained that we need to cut Social Security, or else there will be "nothing left" when it comes time for millennials to retire. The truth is that Social Security can pay out full benefits through 2033, and 75 percent of benefits through 2087. Removing the payroll tax cap so that millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share would close most of Social Security's modest funding gap. Instituting a small and incremental increase in the payroll tax (as has been done many times before, as the nation's wealth increases) would close the gap entirely, and allow us to expand benefits. There is no reason to think millennials will not receive 100 percent of promised benefits -- as long as the anti-Social Security forces do not succeed in gutting the program in the name of "saving" it.

Let's be real here. We know that Social Security cuts aren't likely to affect baby boomers nearly as much as they will the generations that follow -- particularly millennials. So why push the idea that old people are greedy, when all that does is provide ammunition for an argument that will be used to shaft your fellow young people?

Again, we know who's getting all the national wealth, and it's not old people. Let's look at the facts: in 2012, the average Social Security benefit was $13,648, or $1137 a month. And that's the average -- for workers with low earning, or those (primarily women) who take time out of the workforce to perform caregiving work, benefits are often much lower. For two-thirds of beneficiaries, Social Security makes up half their income or more.

Abby, you're fortunate enough to have been born into a well off family. Unfortunately, most Americans are not so lucky. The richest one percent of Americans control over 35 percent of our country's wealth, a massively outsized share of the economic pie. These plutocrats are working mightily to distract the 99 percent by turning them against each other -- men vs. women, whites vs. minorities, and as in this case, young vs. old. Young, socially progressive, moderates like you should know better than to play into these divisive, dangerous and disingenuous lies.

We're writing you together because we know that the generations should fight for these programs together. Younger Richard (we tried to call him "Little Richard," but he didn't know who that was) has no desire to throw his parents and grandparents overboard to serve the agenda of the rich. Older Richard (he's not comfortable being described as "Big Richard" for reasons he'd rather not discuss) wants to protect these programs through the generations that will follow his.

Instead of fighting against each other, it is time for all generations to come together and fight inequality by demanding more aid for children, seniors, and down on their luck Americans of all ages. These expansions can be funded by ending special tax breaks for corporations, asking the wealthy to pay their fair share, and making targeted cuts to the bloated Pentagon budget.

And before we go, let's not forget student loan debt, crushingly high unemployment rates, and low-wage-no-benefit jobs, which are "the norm" amongst younger Americans. With no solutions in sight from Congress, Social Security is more important than ever for young folks.

Now that you have the facts, we hope that you'll tell the truth and stop buying into deceptive arguments designed to mislead the American people.##2934|First Sbarro Pizza file for bankruptcy, and now Quiznos.

The Associated Press reported that the sandwich chain filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday. The chain is reportedly struggling with hundreds of millions of dollars of debt, declining sales and thousands of store closures.

The Denver-based chain, known for its concept of toasted sandwiches, is looking to slice its debt by more than $400 million, the company said in a statement Friday. Executives at the restaurant chain have listed liabilities of between $500 million and $1 billion in its bankruptcy petition.

The company has secured $15 million from its senior lenders to keep the business operating during the process.

"The plan is intended to increase the Company's flexibility as it executes operational enhancements designed to strengthen performance, revitalize the Quiznos brand and reinforce its promise as a fresh, high-quality and great-tasting alternative to traditional fast food offerings," the company said in a press release obtained by Fox Business.

All but seven of its nearly 2,100 restaurants in the United States and 30 other countries are independently owned and operated by franchisees. According to the company's statement, they will not be affected by the bankruptcy.

The company has faced increased competition from rival Subway, which has more than 41,000 franchised locations in about 100 countries. Quiznos also faces competition from newer entrants such as Potbelly, whose low-priced menus have appealed to consumers in a tough economy.

Quiznos bankruptcy protection comes five days after the Sbarro pizza chain did the same, claiming that low foot traffic in malls has led to decreasing pizza sales. It is the second time in three years Sbarro pizza has had to file for bankruptcy, following a trip through bankruptcy proceedings in April 2011 and in November 2011.##2935|Empty##2936|Starbucks iPhone app adds digital tipping

Starbucks has updated its iPhone app to support digital tipping, said by the coffee shop to be one of the most-requested features from its users, while Android support will come later in the year. The new app has also been aesthetically redesigned to make it easier to navigate and fit in with iOS 7’s design style, as well as giving more ready access to details in the My Starbucks Rewards scheme.

Starbucks app users had already been able to pay for their drinks and food with the app, charging it directly to their virtual payment card. Now, however, they’ll also be able to tip the barista in the process, with the app offering $0.50, $1, and $2 options on-screen.

Other changes include shake-to-pay, which calls up the payment barcode by shaking the iPhone.

Digital tipping only works in the US, and only at the roughly 7,000 locations that Starbucks itself operates. Any franchise stores will be cash-only for tips, as usual.

However, the new version of the iPhone app will also be offered in the UK and Canada with its updated interface style. Starbucks also says that an Android version will be released later in the year, also including a tip option.##2937|Holidays are low-hanging fruit for brands on social media. Twitter is rife with weird hashtag holidays that attempt to fill the non-holidays of the year with something special, and just as popular are “legit” holidays like Christmas and Mother’s Day.

There is, however, a right and a wrong way to do it. Most brands do it the wrong (boring) way, though inoffensively; some mess up badly enough that it trends for all the wrong reasons.

The goal of a holiday post is to score some points with an audience that is already primed to celebrate. This isn’t hard to do. A simple graphic with a festive greeting is usually enough to garner some engagement. But the memorable campaigns are the ones that approach holidays with an air of authenticity.

Here are a few tips on keeping it real.

Get Personal

Part of the reason to have a branded social account in the first place is to connect with your audience in a more personal way. Showing the people behind the company name is one of the most effective ways to do that. This boutique digital marketing agency in Ontario used the tactic to crowdsource a Father’s Day campaign to good effect; it highlights a few personal stories without hijacking or altering the meaning behind the holiday.

Get Creative

Every brand on the face of the planet seems to have a generic holiday greeting graphic at the ready. While eye-catching in isolation, these pictures quickly become repetitive when dropped in a sea of similar posts. They also come off as impersonal and inauthentic.

Brands can stand out from the crowd by differentiating themselves. Instead of a plain graphic, why not share photos from a company event celebrating the holiday? Or a quick video message? Or a themed Spotify playlist with your employees’ favourite holiday tunes? These don’t take much more effort than a graphic, but they make a bigger (and realer) impression.

Get Choosy

Every brand doesn’t have to recognize every single holiday on the map. If your company doesn’t have a clear reason to call it out (because it’s important to you or your audience), it’s fine to sit this one out. This will make the holidays you do celebrate on social more meaningful.##2938|Stock markets are set for what could be another nervous week, with continuing tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine and U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers highest on traders’ minds.

A slowdown in China is also weighing on investors. The S&P 500 index ended down 2 percent last week, its biggest weekly loss since late January.

Markets are also on alert after last week's record fall in foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries led to speculation that Russia has reduced its dollar reserves ahead of possible sanctions from the West.

Throw in the fact that this coming Friday, Fitch Ratings is due to announce its review of the U.S. sovereign credit rating, currently standing at AAA with a negative outlook. Any hint of a downgrade could add substantially to market jitters.

The big focus will be on Wednesday, when the Federal Open Market Committee concludes its first meeting since Janet Yellen became chair and is expected to announce another $10 billion a month reduction of the Fed’s bond buying stimulus program.

The Fed’s purchases of Government and mortgage related bonds helped the United States’ economic recovery by creating artificial demand for the debt and therefore helping to keep interest rates at historic lows.

Yellen said last month that while the recovery in the U.S. employment market is "far from complete", the U.S. central bank is likely to continue reducing or "tapering" its monthly bond-buying stimulus program at a "measured" pace as long as the economy continues to improve.

Yellen has also indicated the Fed is likely to keep interest rates at near zero well past the point when unemployment falls below a previous threshold of 6.5 per cent.

Investors as always will watch the language chosen by the FOMC in its statement and by Yellen in her press conference for any hints as to the Fed's schedule for rate rises and further reductions in its bond buying stimulus measures.

Other potentially market moving data expected this coming week includes U.S. industrial production on Monday, housing starts and consumer inflation data on Tuesday, and weekly jobless claims and existing home sales on Thursday.

Also on Thursday, the U.S. Federal Reserve is due to releases the results of its stress tests to determine if the largest financial institutions have enough capital to absorb losses and support their operations during adverse conditions, according to Bloomberg.

Company earnings are expected from Oracle on Tuesday, FedEx and General Mills on Wednesday, Nike on Thursday and Tiffany & Co on Friday.##2939|Empty##2940|Empty##2941|Empty##2942|General Motors shares took a big hit Tuesday as a federal probe was launched into the automaker’s handling of defects complaints tied to 12 deaths.

General Motors stock fell 5%, or $1.91 per share to close at $35.18 in trading Tuesday on reports of the news, and continued to fall Wednesday morning.

The kingpin automaker is under intense scrutiny for its response to complaints about faulty ignition switches, which led last month to a recall of 1.6 million cars. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York is leading the probe, reports the Wall Street Journal, but lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives are also investigating. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) said Monday the House Energy and Commerce Committee will examine whether GM knowingly allowed faulty and dangerous cars to remain in use without recalling them.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recorded a July 2005 death when safety bags did not deploy in a Chevrolet Cobalt, and pointed out the problem to GM in March 2007. The automaker did not recall the vehicles until this year.

The recall of 1.6 million autos covers the 2003-’07 Saturn Ion, the 2006-’07 Chevrolet HHR, the 2006-’07 Pontiac Solstice, the 2007 Saturn Sky, and the 2005-’07 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.

March 23 marks four years since the law took effect, and March 31 marks six months since new marketplaces for health insurance opened in all 50 states.

Millions of Americans—many previously uninsured and uninsurable—will have new health plans in place when this year’s enrollment period ends on the 31st. Millions more will remain uninsured—whether by choice or necessity.

And whatever the final enrollment tallies, the debate over health care reform will rage on. The voting public still strongly disapproves of “Obamacare,” even while strongly favoring most of its provisions. Republicans are preparing to run against it in this fall’s midterm elections, and Democrats are running scared.

Meanwhile, ordinary Americans are still coming to terms with the transformation of health care. The system now taking shape is far more inclusive and accessible than the old one, but people’s experience of it varies widely depending on where they live, where they work, how much they earn, and whether they’re full U.S. citizens.

What does the Affordable Care Act mean to you as a consumer, a voter and taxpayer? What aspects of it still concern or confuse you? Next week, as part of msnbc’s countdown to March 31st, national health reporter Geoffrey Cowley will answer your questions. Cowley has spent more than 25 years covering public health and health care—from the Clinton administration’s ill-fated 1992 reform effort through the passage and rollout of Obamacare.

To ask him a question, simply join the MyHealthCare group and type it into this article’s comment section.

One of the people said the work on the IPO for the Chinese e-commerce company was “not advanced” and “preliminary stuff”, including establishing the ideal timing for the listing to take place and the appropriate listing venue.

However, they acknowledged that the two banks were best positioned to win the official IPO mandate when that was confirmed. No banks had been officially mandated on the deal yet, the people said.

The two banks have worked closely with the company over several years.

Alibaba is expected to raise around US$15bn in New York in the highest-profile internet IPO since Facebook’s US$16bn listing in 2012.

Bloomberg reported today that Alibaba was aiming to go public in the US as soon as April, citing people familiar with the matter, although IFR’s sources suggested that a decision on timing had not yet been taken.

The company had yet to rule out formally a listing in Hong Kong, although executive vice-chairman Joe Tsai told Reuters on Wednesday the company would “never” change its partnership shareholding structure in order to list in Hong Kong.

A deal size of around US$15bn is expected to value the firm at US$80bn–$100bn.

Alibaba did not immediately return calls seeking comment.

Part of the reason for Alibaba’s favouring a listing in the US, rather than Hong Kong, is its partnership structure that allows founder Jack Ma to retain control of the firm despite limited equity ownership.

Ma and his top executives own only about 10% of the firm. US internet firm Yahoo and Japan’s SoftBank own 24% and 37%, respectively. There are currently 28 partners in the company.

The US market allows dual-class share structures, but does not have any exact precedent for the partnership structure of Alibaba.

Alibaba employs more than 20,000 people in over 70 offices in Greater China, Singapore, India, the UK and US. The e-commerce group is so large that it reorganised into 25 business units last year to allow it to adapt to changes quicker.##2950|Empty##2951|Men's Wearhouse has secured a deal to acquire US men's apparel and footwear business Jos A Bank Clothiers following a five-month merger tussle between the two firms.

The two companies have signed an agreement under which Men's Wearhouse will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Jos A Bank for US$65 per share in cash, or $1.8bn. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction.

Combined, Men's Wearhouse and Jos A Bank will operate more than 1,700 stores in the US, with around 23,000 employees and and sales of $3.5bn on a pro forma basis.

Men's Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert said it was "pleased" to have reached the agreement with Jos A Bank, which it believes will deliver "substantial benefits" to their respective shareholders, employees and customers.

"Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos A Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos A Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach," he added. "We expect the transaction will be accretive to Men's Wearhouse's earnings in the first full year."

Men's Wearhouse last week entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Jos A Bank Clothiers under which they discussed a potential merger. The move was a step forward in an ongoing battle over ownership between the two companies, which began with Jos A Bank offering to buy its larger menswear rival.

The agreed price is an improvement on the last bid by Men's Wearhouse of $63.50 in February, which it said would provide Jos A Bank shareholders with a "substantial premium and immediate value".

It did, however, say it would be prepared to increase its offer price to $65 per share if Jos A Bank could demonstrate or Men's Wearhouse could "discover additional value through discussions or limited due diligence".

The saga took a further turn in February when Jos A Bank announced a deal to acquire outdoor wear brand Eddie Bauer, which some industry observers suggested was a move made to ensure it remained independent.

Its tender offer, however, has now been withdrawn as part of the deal with Men's Wearhouse, its said.

Jos A Bank chairman, Robert Wildrick, said: "Our board has been rigorously focused on pursuing a path for our shareholders that maximises value creation. We have been committed to pursuing a range of strategic alternatives to achieve that goal.

"The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded, including a 56% premium since our interest in Men's Wearhouse became public last October, and allowing our shareholders to receive immediate consideration for their holdings."

Jos A Bank's share price was up 3.98% to $64.29 at 12:49 EDT today.##2952|Follow @csaid

EBay has come out swinging against activist investor Carl Icahn.

The San Jose e-tailer on Monday officially rejected Icahn’s proposed two board nominees. Icahn, who holds a 2.2 percent stake in eBay, wants the company to spin off PayPal, its electronic payments division. He wanted two of his employees on the eBay board to promote that agenda.

“Neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise,” said Richard Schlosberg, chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee.

Instead, eBay backs the re-election of four existing board members: President and CEO John Donahoe; Fred Anderson, co-founder and managing director of Elevation Partners; Edward Barnholt, former CEO of Agilent Technologies; and Scott Cook, co-founder and chairman of Intuit.

Talking smack, the company and the pugnacious billionaire issued dueling press releases notable for their frankness.

In a lengthy screed on his website, ShareholdersSquareTable, Icahn accused eBay CEO John Donohoe of “inexcusable incompetence (that) cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion” for selling Skype too soon and too cheaply. He also attacked eBay board member Marc Andreessen, whose investor group bought Skype and then flipped it to Microsoft at a $4 billion premium. Previously, he’d also taken aim at Intuit’s Cook,

Under eBay’s tender ministrations, PayPal may “wither,” Icahn wrote. “ I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL ,” he wrote.

For its part, Ebay said Icahn is dabbling in “false and misleading” statements.

“New eBay shareholder Carl Icahn has cherry-picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context to attack the integrity of two of the most respected, accomplished and value-driven technology leaders in Silicon Valley,” it said, referring to Andreessen and Cook. “And eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe is widely respected for his turnaround of eBay and leadership of the company over the past six years.”

Icahn’s 2.2 percent eBay stake isn’t actually enough for him to actually wrest much control. So what’s his real agenda?

As Icahn biographer Mark Stevens last week told Chronicle business editor and columnist Tom Lee: ”It’s all a game to him. He’s a master chess player. The only person who knows what Carl Icahn really wants is Carl Icahn.”##2953|An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy, worth $201 million.The man who cobbled the deal together said Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990."No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents who he calls a "well-known billionaire."The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said."It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing United Kingdom life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based S.G.

The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors."He wants his next of kin to keep working hard," Frances said.Frances said that the annual premium is in "the low, single digits of millions of dollars." He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon.Frances wouldn't disclose the billionaire's age.Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Frances declined to discuss identity of the policyholder.

However, it settled at $1,339.9/ounce for the week, trimming initial gains on strong economic data from the US. It ended the week up hardly 1 per cent.

Economic numbers from the US last week eroded much of the gains of gold and silver. The Institute for Supply Management reported last week that the manufacturing sector expanded in February. The PMI showed a reading of 53.2 per cent against January’s 51.3 per cent. Also, the weekly claims for jobless benefits dropped to a three-month low and the US economy added 175,000 jobs in February.

Earlier last week, gold prices got a boost from the sell-off in the US dollar. This followed the European Central Bank leaving interest rates untouched in its meeting and President Mario Draghi saying the bank expects economic recovery to continue. The euro hit a high of $1.3915 against the US dollar during the week and closed at $1.3875.

The winners last week were actually the platinum group metals. Fears that sanctions on Russia could hit supply of the precious industrial metals saw investors chasing them, driving prices higher. Platinum rose 2.5 per cent to $1,482.5/ounce. Palladium, too, rallied sharply to end the week at $781.6/ounce. Last week, talks between South Africa’s top platinum miners and their labour groups failed, increasing the threat of reduced supply. News of the US mint resuming sales of the American Eagle platinum coin on demand also helped push prices higher. Silver prices that were upbeat initially closed 1 per cent lower for the week at $20.94/ounce.

Gold prices in India still continue to trade at 5-6 per cent premium to international price. Dealers say the premium may continue till restrictions on gold imports remain. In India, gold prices are fixed by the industry body. These prices are not based on virtual order books or computer generated buy/sell bids. They are fixed by a few big dealers who arrive at a price depending on the orders they receive. Lack of transparency makes the prices move ₹100-300 higher or lower for little reason. London gold benchmark prices (which are used to determine gold prices globally) are also fixed the same way. Last week, a New York resident filed a lawsuit against the bankers for colluding to manipulate the London gold fix prices. Gold futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange closed the week at ₹30,130/10 gm, up barely 0.1 per cent. Silver futures ended 0.3 per cent lower at ₹46,205/100 gm. Gains were muted as the rupee strengthened against the greenback last week. The rupee gained 1 per cent and ended at 61.08 versus the dollar. The gain in the rupee followed improved current account deficit numbers.

Cues to watch

Gold prices might retract on profit-booking by investors if tensions in Crimea ease next week. But, note that some concerns of last year that drove gold down 28 per cent, have eased and there is room for a price upside in the medium term. Investors have started to hoard gold again. The SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, which started the year with a holding of 798.22 tonnes, holds 805.2 tonnes of gold now. Also, the improving situation on the balance of payments in India is a signal that restrictions on gold imports could be lifted soon.

The yellow metal may also have new takers. A solar panel producer in China has defaulted on interest payments on its bond on Friday. With the Government not chipping in to bail out the company, Chinese investors are getting anxious about more cases of default in the bond market. Next week, along with the developments in Ukraine, the market would also closely follow the US jobless claim numbers on Thursday. On the same day, retail sales and the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort index will be released. On Friday, the Producer Price Index that measures the change in price received by domestic producers of goods and services will be announced. Prices will, however, be only volatile till the US Federal Reserve’s meeting on March 19.

The gold chart remains in the favour of bulls. The $1,354/ounce level hit on Monday is the immediate resistance for the metal. If this level is breached, the next target is $1,360. Beyond this, the next level is high up at $1,433. However, a pullback next week cannot be ruled out. The support level is $1,314.

MCX Gold futures have to firmly move above ₹30,500 levels for the medium-term trend to turn positive. Next week, targets on the lower side are ₹29,635 and ₹29,500. Resistance is at ₹30,748 and ₹31,574. MCX Silver, too, needs to break above ₹47,000 levels. Till then, there will only be sideways movements. Support is at ₹45,692 and ₹45,200 and resistance at ₹48,000 and ₹49,112.##2955|NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — U.S. stock futures got a boost on Thursday from a duo of reports, which showed a surprise drop in weekly jobless claims and a rise in retail sales in February.

Shares of Plug Power Inc. and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. both jumped in premarket on earnings reports.

Futures for the S&P 500 index US:SPH4 rose 4.2 points to 1,871.90, while those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJH4 added 31 points to 16,370. Futures for the Nasdaq-100 index US:NDH4 added 12 points to 3,718.75.

The number of people who applied for U.S. unemployment benefits in the first week of March fell to the lowest level in more than three months, perhaps a sign of an uptick in labor-market conditions.

Sales at U.S. retailers rose in February for the first time in three months as shoppers boosted purchases of a variety of goods after being cooped up by one of the harshest winters in years.

Another focus for Wall Street will be the question-and-answer session during a Senate hearing of three nominees to the Federal Reserve. Those nominees released their written testimony on Wednesday, and the most prominent, Stanley Fischer, said the Fed’s easy U.S. monetary stance is still needed. The Q&A will start at 10 a.m. Eastern.

U.S. stocks finished little changed on Wednesday after erasing early losses that stemmed from a selloff of overseas markets. Worries about a China slowdown and Russia-Ukraine tensions contributed to early jitters, though the S&P 500 SPX, +0.10% ended up 0.57 point, or less than 0.1%, at 1,868.20.

China data shows industrial production, retail sales slowing

Asian markets were mixed, with the Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.10% ending flat, and the Hang Seng Index HSI, -2.38% falling 0.7% after data showed China’s industrial production slowed to 8.6% in the January-February period, versus 9.7% in December. Retail sales in China eased to 11.8% in January, from 13.1% in December.

Some analysts brushed the readings aside, while others saw a sharper slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. In a note, analysts at Danske Bank said the data suggests the economy is slowing faster than expected, and the slowdown in industrial production suggests growth in gross domestic product could drop below the government’s 7.5% target as soon as the first quarter.

Bloomberg Shoppers walk through the Westfield North County Mall in Escondido, California, U.S., on Sunday, Nov. 17, 2013.

Going the other way, the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +1.06% rose 1%. Some attributed this to comments by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who said he was confident the Chinese economy would meet its 7.5% growth goal for this year. He also acknowledged that defaults of some financing vehicles may be inevitable, but the government would closely monitor the situation.

Some said Shanghai stocks were also boosted by media reports that China’s securities regulator may allow companies to issue preferred shares within the first half of the year, as it works to try to deliver market-boosting measures to lift confidence in the battered market.

Gold US:GCJ4 shifted moderately lower, but copper prices US:HGK4 under pressure this week due to China worries, were off another 3.3%.

The dollar DXY, +0.21% meanwhile, fell across the board after stronger-than-expected labor-market data in Australia, which pushed the Aussie dollar AUDUSD, -0.4984% back above 90 cents. The euro EURUSD, -0.2591% remained above $1.39, after moving above that on Wednesday. Oil prices fell slightly.

Shares of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts US:KKD soared 10% in premarket after the donut maker lifted its financial guidance for the current fiscal year late Wednesday.

Williams-Sonoma Inc. WSM, -1.06% jumped 6.6% in premarket after the retailer topped forecasts with its quarterly earnings and revenue, as well as announcing a hike in its dividend late Wednesday.

Plug Power PLUG, -0.26% rose more than 12% after the fuel-cell company topped a sales forecast in results on Thursday.

China's Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to continue search efforts for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight "as long as there is a glimmer of hope".

His comments came as Vietnam and Malaysia investigated satellite images released by China that appeared to show possible debris in the South China Sea.

However, they were unable to find debris at the same location.

Meanwhile, one report said US officials suspected the plane flew for four hours after its last confirmed location.

However, Malaysia's transport minister described the report as inaccurate at a press conference on Thursday.

He also said China's embassy in Kuala Lumpur had said Beijing's satellite images had been released by mistake and did not appear to relate to the missing plane.

'Fruitless sightings'

Flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing went missing late on Friday, with 239 passengers and crew on board.

Teams have since been searching waters on both sides of the Malaysian peninsula for any sign of the plane.

Satellite images, released by China on Wednesday, appeared to identify floating objects 150 miles (250km) or so from the aircraft's last known position.

However, Dinh Viet Thang, deputy director of Vietnam's Civil Aviation Authority, told AFP that two planes sent to inspect the area had returned, and "found nothing so far".

Similarly, Malaysian Civil Aviation Chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman told reporters that Malaysia's planes did not find anything.

"There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing," he said.

Several previous sightings of possible debris in other areas have proved fruitless.

Diverted plane?

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal said that US investigators suspected that the plane stayed airborne long after its last confirmed contact.

Citing two unidentified sources "familiar with the details", WSJ said that data downloaded from the Boeing 777's engines led investigators to believe that the plane flew for a total of five hours.

US officials are exploring whether someone on the plane could have turned off the aircraft's transponders to avoid radar detection, and then diverted the plane towards another location, WSJ added.

Malaysia Airlines and Boeing officials, as well as representatives from plane engine-makers Rolls-Royce, declined to comment on the points reported by WSJ.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang made his comments at a press conference that came as China's annual parliament session ended: "We will not give up on any suspected clue that has been found.

"This is an international and large-scale search operation involving many countries."

Analysis With 154 Chinese citizens on board the missing jet, China has redeployed at least 10 of its satellites to help in the search. The photographs of the three objects, the largest of which measures around 24 metres by 22 metres, were taken on Sunday, the day after the plane vanished, but were only published on Wednesday. The wingspan of the missing Boeing 777 is around 61 metres. The satellite images place the objects 150 miles (250km) or so from the aircraft's last known position over the South China Sea and 250 miles from an oil rig on which a worker reported seeing a burning object in the sky on Saturday morning.

He also urged Malaysia to step up search efforts, saying: "The Chinese government has asked relevant parties to enhance co-ordination, investigate the cause, locate the missing plane as quickly as possible and properly handle all related matters."

Earlier, China's foreign ministry complained that there was "too much confusion" regarding information released about the plane's flight path.

The plane vanished late on Friday, about an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur.

No distress signal or message was sent from the flight, which was carrying 153 Chinese nationals among its passengers.

Earlier, Malaysian authorities revealed that the last communication from the jet suggested everything was normal on board.

Flight MH370 replied "All right, roger that" to a radio message from Malaysian air control, authorities said. Minutes later all contact with the plane was lost.##2957|Question: What does Obamacare mean for the Latino community?

Answer: For members of all ethnic groups, the Affordable Care Act helps expand opportunity and freedom to access quality, affordable health coverage that for too many was denied them. But there are benefits that have a greater impact specifically on the Latino community.

Latinos are disproportionately uninsured in the American population. But now 80% of uninsured Latinos eligible for marketplace coverage will have access to lower-cost health options, such as tax credits for private insurance plans on healthcare.gov or BadgerCare here in Wisconsin.

Citizens and documented immigrants may sign up at healthcare.gov. However, undocumented immigrants may not. But households of mixed status should not fear looking for coverage. Healthcare.gov cannot require individuals purchasing coverage for themselves to disclose the immigration/citizen status of anyone else in the household.

There will be new options to get health care as well. The Affordable Care Act expands funding to community health centers, such as the 16th Street Community Health Center here in Milwaukee, to serve new patients. And one out of every three patients at a community health center is Latino.

Lastly, Latino health care professionals will have new opportunities thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Expanded programs like the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) will provide more care and train more physicians. One out of ten NHSC physicians are Latino. That’s twice the rate than in the national physician workforce. New advancement opportunities are available for many.

While many Americans speak English as their first language or they are bilingual, some just prefer their first language. You can apply online at healthcare.gov, and in Spanish at cuidadodesalud.gov. Get help in more than 150 languages by calling the 24/7 call center at 1-800-318-2596. Open enrollment ends March 31, so be sure to sign up for the Affordable Care Act while you can.

Revenue from Fannie, Freddie triple that of 2012 government estimate

The White House budget office said Monday that it anticipates the government could take in nearly $179 million in profits over the next ten years if the terms of their conservatorship remain intact, tripling the government estimated profit from just one year ago.

In the wake of the 2008 mortgage-backed securities failure that preceded the stock market sell-off, the US government provided Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) $187.5 billion in bailout funds to keep the firms in business. After current payments are made at the end of this month, Fannie and Freddie will have repaid $202.9 billion to the government.

Amended agreement subject of lawsuits

In 2012 the government amended the bailout agreement, saying that all profits would flow to the US Treasury, with nothing going to shareholders as opposed to a 10% dividend on the bailout funds only. Buoyed by a strong housing market, the mortgage finance giants were much more profitable than anticipated, leading remaining shareholders to hope that the dividend stream would return.

Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) were thought of as highly conservative investments and held in the portfolios of many mom and pop retail investors as well as pension and retirement funds. When the crisis hit and the government took control, many confused retail investors sold their shares to hedge funds such as Perry Capital and Fairholme Capital Management, who are now aggressively lobbying the government to return the company into shareholder hands.

Activist Ralph Nader’s voice is heard

As previously noted in ValueWalk, Ralph Nader, a shareholder, is taking an activist stance as well. At a recent roundtable on the topic:

“In all the discussions following the 2008 Wall Street collapsed that involved Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC), there was very little attention paid to the owners, the shareholders,” Nader said in prepared remarks. “These shareholders were assured in 2008 by the regulator (Lockhart) and then Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson that both Fannie and Freddie were adequately capitalized and there was ‘nothing to worry about.’ Then a few weeks later they collapsed… What was interesting about those assurances (from Lockhart, Bernanke and Paulson) is that they were conducted by government officials. If corporate officials ever made those kinds of deceptive comments, even the Securities and Exchange Commission would have woken up and we would have seen some enforcement clarity. But it didn’t happen.”

Shareholders maintain that the decision by the Treasury to claim Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) profits as dividend payments is “plainly unlawful,” according to Theodore Olson, a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP representing a shareholder, hedge fund Perry Capital. Olson, a former U.S. solicitor general who represents them, who spoke at the event, said “This deal has proven extraordinarily lucrative for the federal government.”

Shareholders “zombies?”

When characterizing the jilted shareholders, Nader described the group by saying “We are not talking about day traders. We are talking about investors who had been told Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) were the safest investments next to treasuries.” The government is now treating shareholders “as if they were zombies,” he said.##2963|Mt.Gox, the Japanese Bitcoin exchange that last month filed for bankruptcy protection amid outcry from customers, has updated its website to allow customers to log in and check their accounts.

The US government's February payrolls report, released on Friday, showed employers added 175,000 jobs, a more generous amount than had been predicted by economists, while January's jobs gain was revised up. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, from 6.6 percent, as more people began looking for work.

The data cemented expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers will keep reducing the pace of monthly bond purchases, decreased by US$10 billion increments in the most recent two meetings to US$65 billion currently. The Federal Open Market Committee begins its next two-day meeting on March 18.

Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 1 percent to close at a record on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.65 percent. So far in 2014, the S&P 500 has gained 2 percent, while the Nasdaq has advanced 4.1 percent. The Dow has slipped 0.2 percent.

Evidence of resilience in the US jobs market reduced the appeal of Treasuries. Bonds fell for the week, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note 14 basis points higher to 2.79 percent.

The latest US economic data will arrive in the form of the NFIB small business optimism index and whole sale trade, due Tuesday; weekly jobless claims, retail sales, import and export prices, and business inventories, due Thursday; and consumer sentiment, due Friday.

Today, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser will speak on monetary policy, banks and protectionism in Paris, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will talk on the economy and monetary policy in Columbus, Georgia.

While investors opted to focus on good news from the US economy last week, concern about the latest developments of the Ukraine crisis and their consequences on financial markets will stay on everyone's radar.

"Ukraine was a very big deal and created a ton of market volatility and had a huge impact on the stock market," Richard Slinn, a San Francisco-based investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank, told Bloomberg News. "We're watching that closely, but you can't manage portfolios on geopolitical issues."

In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index shed 1.5 percent last week. The UK's FTSE 100 dropped 1.1 percent, France's CAC 40 fell 1.2 percent, while Germany's DAX slumped 2 percent.

Here, economic reports due in the coming days include euro-zone Sentix investor confidence, due today; Germany's trade balance, due Tuesday; euro-industrial production, due Wednesday; and German CPI and euro-zone employment, due Friday.

Investors remain concerned about a slowdown in the pace of growth in the world's second-largest economy, China. As a result, copper prices have slumped 9 percent this year, the most among 34 commodities tracked by Bloomberg. On Friday, copper futures for delivery in May dropped 4.2 percent to settle at US$3.0825 a pound.

"Copper is particularly exposed to Chinese issues due to palpably high local stocks and associated financing deals," BNP Paribas strategists including Stephen Briggs, said in a report, according to Bloomberg News.

There was more evidence to support that concern over the weekend. China's exports unexpectedly sank in February, plunging 18.1 percent from a year earlier, according to General Administration of Customs data.

"February export numbers were a surprise on the downside, and even combined January-February numbers were below market expectations," Li Heng, an economist at Minsheng Securities in Beijing, told Reuters. "The data shows that the economy faces relatively big downward pressures and macro-policies need to be loosened a bit."

Sbarro filed for bankruptcy on Monday after struggling with debt and low consumer traffic

Last month, Sbarro said it would close 155 of about 400 restaurants it owns in North America to cut costs

Sbarro was founded in Brooklyn, New York in 1956 by Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro, a married couple who had immigrated from Naples, Italy

Sbarro LLC, the pizza restaurant chain, on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years, after struggling with too much debt and lower customer traffic in the malls that house many of its restaurants.



Sbarro and more than 30 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.



The Melville, New York-based company has between $100 million and $500 million in both assets and liabilities, according to court papers.



Unfortunately Sbarro doesn't have enough dough to pay back their debts and have been forced to file for bankruptcy

Last month, Sbarro said it would close 155 of about 400 restaurants it owns in North America to cut costs.



Following those closures, it would still have more than 800 restaurants worldwide, including those owned by franchisees.



Moody's Investors Service in January said Sbarro has also struggled with high food, labor and occupancy costs.

Company representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Sbarro's restructuring plans.



Sbarro was founded in Brooklyn, New York in 1956 by Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro, a married couple who had immigrated from Naples, Italy.



It expanded in the New York City area before launching in 1967 its typical restaurant format, which includes an open kitchen and lets customers serve themselves.



The company had previously filed for protection from creditors in April 2011, and emerged from Chapter 11 the following November.



The company will have no more than 800 restaurants worldwide after they are forced to close many locations to cut costs





##2969|Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba says it is gearing up to go public on a US stock exchange in what is likely to be the world's biggest initial public offering this year. Investment banks have valued Alibaba at as much as $200bn. Photo: AP

Hong Kong - Alibaba Group would begin the process of filing for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US that may be the biggest since Facebook, China’s biggest e-commerce company said at the weekend.

The announcement comes after Alibaba struggled to persuade Hong Kong regulators to approve a proposed governance structure that would allow its partners to nominate a majority of its board of directors.

A listing in China might be considered “should circumstances permit in the future”, the company said yesterday.

Investment banks have valued Alibaba, founded by former English teacher Jack Ma, at as much as $200 billion (R2.15 trillion), which would make it the biggest internet company behind Google based on market capitalisation. A US share sale by Alibaba would be a blow to Hong Kong, which has not hosted an IPO of more than $4bn since October 2010.

“Alibaba’s preference to keep its partnership structure is probably the biggest reason it chose to list in the US,” said Stephen Yang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial. “The US has more investors and analysts in the technology space.”

Alibaba has not decided when to file for the listing, how much it plans to raise, how large a stake it may sell or which exchange in the US it would seek to list on, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company did not say if it had hired banks to manage the IPO.

“This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency,” Alibaba said in its statement. “We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong.”

The prospectus for an IPO might be disclosed as soon as next month, people familiar with the matter have said. The company was also working with New York-based law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, two people familiar with the matter have said.

Alibaba’s expansion since Ma started the company in his Hangzhou apartment in 1999 with two dozen items for sale mirrors China’s emergence as an economic superpower. The company had about 25 000 employees at the end of last month and generated about 70 percent of package deliveries in China in 2012.

There is still room for growth. China has 618 million internet users, greater than the population of any other country except India, and McKinsey estimates China’s internet retail market will triple to $395bn from 2011 to next year.

In January Alibaba, which operates online markets for products from Louis Vuitton bags to Boston lobsters, posted its fourth consecutive quarterly profit on surging sales.

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $792 million in the three months to September last year, a 12 percent increase from the June quarter, according to a January presentation from Yahoo, which owns a 24 percent stake. Revenue rose 51 percent to $1.78bn.

Analyst valuations of Alibaba rose 28 percent after the earnings, with the company worth $153bn, according to the average of 10 estimates compiled last month. – Bloomberg##2970|Empty##2971|The Obama administration announced Monday that more than 5 million people have signed up for new insurance plans under the health-care law, suggesting new momentum as the March 31 deadline for coverage this year approaches.

About 800,000 people have selected health plans on the state and federal insurance marketplaces this month, officials said in a blog post — almost as many as signed up during all of February. The figure brings the administration closer to Congressional Budget Office projections that 6 million people would enroll by the end of March.

Officials had predicted that the pace of enrollments would pick up this month, because March 31 is the last day to sign up for a marketplace plan and avoid a fine. The health law requires most Americans to have health insurance or incur a penalty of $95 or 1 percent of their income this year, whichever is higher.

Officials have not said how many of those who have enrolled have paid their initial premiums.##2972|CLOSE

AP investigation: Drug prices going up despite Trump promise##2973|As Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held his annual press conference at the close of the National People’s Conference, economic writers like myself were waiting for any clues about where Beijing’s policy team is heading on reform. To say this is a real press conference is something of an overstatement — like all government events, it is stage-managed, with all questions carefully vetted and selected in advance. But it is still a rare opportunity to at least hear directly from the otherwise unapproachable Chinese leadership. And though Li offered few details (as usual) and his language was vague (as usual), he did indicate that the government’s attitude toward the economy is changing in extremely important ways for the nation’s future.

Here we can find good news in the Premier’s bad news. The substance of Li’s comments suggested that China is heading for a rough patch, but he and his policy team are not going to pump it up at all costs. “We are not pursuing GDP growth alone,” he declared. This is an especially meaningful statement. In the past, China’s government felt compelled to supersize growth rates as soon as the economy showed any signs of faltering, as they did after the 2008 global financial crisis. But that has led to all sorts of problems for the economy — rising levels of debt, a shaky financial system and unhealthy excess capacity. Economists almost universally agree that Beijing has to start balancing its desire for growth with tough reforms to fix the negative fallout from that growth. In that way, China’s economy would be set upon a more stable future.

Li indicated that the days of blindly building GDP are over. Though he confessed that “China’s economy still faces severe challenges this year,” he went on to admit that “the space for wielding fiscal and monetary policy has limits, and [macroeconomic] regulation certainly faces many hard choices.” Instead, Li acknowledged that the economy has serious problems that must be addressed — terrible pollution, too much debt, inefficiency — and that the government needs to strike a balance between ensuring economic expansion and repairing its weaknesses. “We need to face up to the difficulties and challenges and make the most of the favorable conditions,” Li said. “Only a sharpened ax can cut through firewood.”

However, the question he left open is: How sharp is his ax? Li’s prudent comments are exactly what economists and investors want to hear — that Beijing will start to prioritize reform to set the stage for healthier growth rather than sacrificing everything for growth. Yet how committed are they to that course? Some economists are forecasting growth rates well below the government’s 7.5% target. How far will Li and his team allow growth to slip? Li left open the possibility that the government would jump in. “The acceptable lowest limit of GDP growth needs to ensure enough employment and that people’s incomes are increasing,” he said.

If the economy continues to slow over the course of 2014, Beijing may have to make a difficult choice — growth or reform — that will likely shape the direction of the economy for years to come. So, as usual, Li told people what they wanted to hear. We’ll have to see if he means it.##2974|General Motors is coming under mounting criticism for its handling of a serious defect. Last month, the company recalled 1.6 million vehicles because of faulty ignition switches linked to 13 deaths. The cars, made from 2003-2007, could stall or fail to deploy their airbags.

It's an issue GM has known about for a while, and now Congress wants to know why it took the automaker almost a decade to warn the public about it.

When there is an accident with a car that could involve new technology or a defect, the government sends in a team: the special crash investigators.

Allan Kam, a retired senior attorney for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says when investigators for the government first heard rumblings of problems with the now-discontinued Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, they filed a report.

The report, he says, "indicated loss of power and it was a kind of report which should have raised all kinds of red flags in the agency. It should have been referred to the Office of Defects Investigation to consider opening up a formal investigation."

It turns out the problem was the ignition. Essentially, a heavy keychain can put the ignition switch into the wrong position: Like when your car is sort of halfway on, and just the lights and radio are working but you can't drive.

Kam says NHTSA can only investigate problems that are brought to its attention. Carmakers are always hearing about potential defects from dealers, consumers and suppliers. GM had the first inklings of the problem 10 years ago.

"What you have is a failure, an apparent failure, of General Motors to make a defect determination which would result in a mandatory recall in a timely manner," Kam says. "And we're not talking here just about weeks and months — we're talking about years."

When a car company finds out about a defect, it's supposed to let authorities know within five days. NHTSA is asking GM what it knew and when.

The company has opened its own investigation and it hired a former U.S. attorney to lead the inquiry.

Now Congress has opened its own inquiry. Republican Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania is on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is investigating. He says he wants to know what GM knew and what the government knew as well.

"It sounds like there was enough loose ends here, enough data taking place that at least in retrospect we see there were trends pointing to a deadly problem," Murphy says. "And I want to know what each side knew."

Jack Nerad, with Kelley Blue Book, says the auto industry and its regulators work closely together.

"Well, I think NHTSA is viewed now as a part of the industry," Nerad says. NHTSA walks the line that any agency must when it oversees an industry, he says. "Well, I think most often NHTSA and the industry work together quite well. I think there is good, healthy give and take. One can question occasionally how quickly they move."

By law it doesn't matter necessarily how quickly the government moves — carmakers have a responsibility to point out problems. How quickly GM moves, however, could have wider effects.

"GM is a really a very special case because there really is an old GM and a new GM," says Jake Fisher, with Consumer Reports. He says the Cobalt is a sign of how bad the old GM was.

"It wasn't pretty. We weren't fans of the Cobalt. It was [an] uncompetitive vehicle that wasn't reliable."

Fisher says the company has improved tremendously in the last several years, but that may not matter.

"The vehicles of the old GM, which is ... the majority of the fleet out there, those bad experiences are having with those vehicles is going to make them not want to give the new GM a chance," he says. "Forget about the recall. Even in the best situation [if it's] not a very good car, why would you want to come back to GM."

In addition to the Cobalt, the recall includes the Chevrolet HHR, the Pontiac G5 and Solstice and the Saturn Ion and Sky.

And I'm Robert Siegel. General Motors is coming under mounting criticism for its handling of a serious defect. Last month the company recalled 1.6 million vehicles because of faulty ignition switches. They've been linked to 13 deaths. The cars could stall or fail to deploy their airbags. It's an issue GM has known about for a while and now Congress wants to know why it took the automaker almost a decade to warn the public about it.

NPR's Sonari Glinton reports.

SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: When there's an accident with a car that could involve new technology or defect, the government sends in a team, the Special Crash Investigators, or SCI unit. Allan Kam is a retired senior attorney for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA. He says when investigators for the government first heard rumblings of problems with the now-discontinued Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, they filed a report.

ALLAN KAM: The SCI report indicated loss of power and it was a kind of report which should have raised all kinds of red flags in the agency. It should have been referred to the Office of Defects Investigation to consider opening up a formal investigation.

GLINTON: It turns out the problem was the ignition. Essentially a heavy keychain can put the ignition switch into the wrong position. You know how when your car is sort of halfway on, and just the lights and radio are working, but you can't drive? That's what was happening. Kam says NHTSA can only investigate problems that are brought to its attention. Carmakers are always hearing about potential defects from dealers, consumers and suppliers, and GM had the first inklings 10 years ago.

KAM: What you have is a failure, an apparent failure, of General Motors to make a defect determination which would, you know, result in a mandatory recall in a timely manner. And we're not talking here just about weeks and months, we're talking about years.

GLINTON: When a car company finds out about a defect, it's supposed to let authorities know within five days. NHTSA is asking GM what did it know and when. General Motors has opened its own investigation and it hired a former U.S. attorney to lead. Now Congress has opened its own probe. Republican Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania is on the House committee that's investigating. He says he wants to know what GM knew and what the government knew as well.

REPRESENTATIVE TIM MURPHY: It sounds like there was enough loose ends here, enough data taking place that at least in retrospect. We see there were trends pointing to a deadly problem and I want to know what each side knew.

JACK NERAD: Well, I think NHTSA is viewed now as a part of the industry.

GLINTON: Jack Nerad is with Kelley Blue Book. He says NHTSA walks the line that any agency must when it oversees an industry.

NERAD: Well, I think most often NHTSA and the industry work together quite well. I think there is good, healthy give and take. One can question occasionally how quickly they move.

GLINTON: By law it doesn't matter necessarily how quickly the government moves; carmakers have a responsibility to point out problems. How quickly GM moves, however, could have wider effects.

JAKE FISHER: Well, you know, GM is a really a very special case because there really is an old GM and a new GM.

It has everything to do with how Fed Chair Janet Yellen articulates the path forward in her first meeting with the press Wednesday afternoon.

In guidance released last year, the central bank sought to calm market concerns about potential interest rate increases by laying out a quantitative threshold that committee members would be watching as they considered whether it was time to start raising interest rates again. Instead of just promising that interest rates would stay close to zero until, say, mid-2015, the Fed signaled it would hold steady until the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.5 percent as long as inflation also didn’t rise above 2.5 percent.

That unemployment figure is now within sight. The economy could easily reach it with a month or two of solid job creation, given that the rate currently stands at 6.7 percent.

Related: Yellen’s High-Stakes Challenge on Unemployment

The Fed, being the Fed, has been very careful about the language officials have used when discussing interest rate policies, and they have been quite clear that the 6.5 percent figure is a threshold, not a trigger for action. More recently, the bank’s policymakers have made clear that they will keep rates low well past the point that threshold is reached.

So nobody expects a sudden spike in interest rates coming out of this week’s two-day meeting or, indeed, any time this year. But businesses and investors plan for the long-term as well as the short-term, and Yellen will have to address the impact falling unemployment has on the FOMC’s thinking, even if actual policy movements are unlikely in the near term.

It’s clear that Yellen will have to lay out a new way to signal the Fed’s intentions – something more qualitative and open to interpretation – than relying on a hard number that could cause the market to make assumptions about imminent interest rate moves. The central bankers have already shifted their emphasis to that so-called “forward guidance,” but markets and Fed watchers will be eager to hear more about just what indicators Yellen and her colleagues will be watching.

Michael Feroli, a research analyst at J.P. Morgan predicted that Yellen would use the FOMC’s post-meeting statement, as well as her meeting with the press to help smooth the transition from quantitative to more qualitative guidance.

“Recent Fed-speak has increasingly focused on what Atlanta Fed President Lockhart has called the ‘shadow labor force,’ Feroli wrote in a research note. “In particular, the statement could begin to reference a desire to see lower levels of part-time employment for economic reasons and in measured marginal attachment to the labor force, such as discouraged workers.”



Related: Yellen Says Fed Needs “Firmer Handle” on Soft Data

Analysts at Nomura Securities said that while they expect the FOMC to jettison most of the quantitative aspects of forward guidance, they believe policymakers will retain language indicating that they “will maintain a low interest rate if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.”

The need for the Fed to adjust its forward guidance, interestingly, comes just a week after the influential Bank for International Settlements published a paper calling into question the overall usefulness of forward guidance as a tool.

The paper concluded, “The recent increased reliance on forward guidance has been helpful in clarifying policy intentions in highly unusual economic circumstances. However, the mixed evidence concerning the effectiveness of these practices, and the challenges they raise, caution against drawing firm conclusions about their ultimate value.”

Given that Yellen was an early supporter of aggressive forward guidance from the Fed, and that she has signaled that policies under her leadership will be largely consistent with those under her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, whatever the market hears on Wednesday will likely reflect a change in nuance rather than a change in overall philosophy.

Top Reads from The Fiscal Times##2976|The Federal Trade Commission has opened a formal investigation into Herbalife's operations Wednesday, pushing shares of the nutrition and weight loss company sharply lower.



Shares of Herbalife plunged as much as 15 percent after being temporarily halted but gradually recovered from lows, ending the day down 7.3 percent. Shares were up more than 4 percent prior to the halt. A circuit breaker also briefly halted trading in shares of rival Nu Skin due to volatility.

A source familiar with the probe told CNBC that Herbalife was surprised by the investigation but thought it was the best way to combat allegations about the company's business model.

The probe is expected to last a year or more.##2977|Empty##2978|House Republican leaders are committed to passing an Obamacare alternative before the November elections, but even proponents of the effort are skeptical that it will produce anything beyond a set of policy principles.

Senior Republicans charged with writing health care legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act are grappling with two major challenges: Drafting a package that can attract enough GOP votes to clear the House and crafting policy that doesn't undermine the party's politically effective criticism of Obamacare. To avoid those roadblocks, Republicans are signaling that they might delay plans for comprehensive legislation in favor of passing a set of narrowly targeted reforms.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., is running the process, with an assist from his leadership deputies and top committee chairmen. Rank-and-file Republicans familiar with their work describe it as a diligent attempt to develop workable, conservative health care policy that jettisons what Americans dislike about Obamacare while addressing the problems with health insurance that have lingered since the law was enacted in 2010. Nothing is likely to be ready for consideration before July.

“House Republicans will offer our own solutions that focus on patient-centered care, while reducing costs through increased competition, improving outcomes and expanding choices and coverage,” Cantor told the Washington Examiner in a statement provided by his office. “Repealing Obamacare is a prerequisite, but we will also share our alternative approach with working middle-class families being harmed by that law.”

According to Republican sources, Cantor at the very least wants to craft a midterm campaign agenda for health care that can be used as the basis for legislation next January, in the event that the GOP wins control of the Senate and is in a position to send legislation to President Obama's desk.

Rank-and-file House Republicans are doubtful Cantor will achieve much more than that before Nov. 4. Contributing to the skepticism that a sweeping Obamacare alternative will receive a floor vote is the heated political season — now fully underway — and House Republicans’ recent history of repeated failures to unify behind big-ticket legislation. The caucus is roughly split over what to do, and not along the usual conservative-Establishment lines.

Half of the House majority is aligned with leadership and supports passing a comprehensive alternative to the Affordable Care Act before the Nov. 4 elections. Among them are some of the staunchest conservatives in the House who especially bristle at Democratic charges that they have no ideas for how to reform health care other than repealing Obamacare.

The other half of the caucus also agrees that Republicans should offer an Obamacare replacement. But they prefer to wait until after the midterms, when doing so might be less politically hazardous and not run the risk of distracting voters from the ongoing problems with the Affordable Care Act.

The division, predicted one House Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity, means that the caucus probably will have to settle for passing a “milquetoast” piece of legislation, or, more likely, releasing a broad list of health care principles.

“The discussions still are going on that are, politically, would we be smart to put out an alternative plan or not? That’s what the debate is about right now,” Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, said. “You don’t want to give your opponents something to shoot at, and any alternative people are going to be able to shoot at in some way or another.”

House Republicans have reviewed an extensive amount of public and private polling about Obamacare since its rocky rollout began Oct. 1.

Even though the Affordable Care Act’s consistently low approval ratings have positioned the GOP to gain House seats and flip control of the Senate in November, House Republicans have concluded from the data that simply vowing to repeal Obamacare is not enough to capitalize on voters’ disenchantment with the law. To win seats, House Republicans believe they must pair their criticism with a proactive health care agenda of their own.

The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll lends credence to the Republicans' conclusions. In the national survey, only 35 percent of respondents said they thought “President Obama's health care plan” was a “good idea.” And yet, 48 percent said they would be more likely to vote for a Democrat in November who supports “fixing and keeping” the law; 47 percent were more inclined to vote for a Republican who backs “repealing and eliminating” it.

A recent survey jointly conducted by Democratic and Republican pollsters for America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry lobbying group, revealed similar findings. Overall, only 34 percent of respondents expressed support for the law and voters motivated by their disapproval of the statute are more likely to vote this year. But by a margin of 54 percent to 28 percent, they favored “fixing” Obamacare over “totally eliminating” it.

That is why, even after the Republicans' victory last week in Florida in a closely watched special House election fought largely over Obamacare, normally cautious GOP political consultants are recommending that House Republicans develop a health care agenda they can campaign on. One GOP strategist focused on House races said Republicans don't need to pass legislation, but need to be able to tell voters what they would put in place of Obamacare.

“The priority for us, our candidates and especially our members is that they have the ability to talk about what they’re for when it comes to health care,” the strategist said. “Democrats saying we would put the insurance companies back in charge has the capability to resonate."##2979|Bitcoin exchange MtGox is now displaying a login screen for users to check their balances, instead of the legal notices it has displayed for the past few weeks.

Late last month the Tokyo-based service filed for bankruptcy protection, according to Japanese media reports. A lawyer representing the company made a statement at the Tokyo District Court on February 28 and claimed that the company had outstanding debts of ¥6.5 billion.

Rumours also circulated that 744,000 bitcoin, the equivalent of £251 million , had been stolen. The amount equates to six per cent of all the coins in circulation.

The website provided a way for customers to exchange US dollars for bitcoins, a digital cryptocurrency that has soared in price over recent years but remains largely unregulated.

It remains unclear when users will be able to access their bitcoins.

A message on the site read: “This balance confirmation service is provided on this site only for the convenience of all users. Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgement by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users.”

In the days leading up to MtGox's collapse, the exchange was reportedly attacked 150,000 times per second by hackers issuing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

MtGox was founded in 2010 by programmer Jed McCaleb, who sold the company to Tibanne Co. in March 2011. It became the world’s largest marketplace for bitcoins, handling an estimated 80 per cent of all transactions of the digital currency.

Earlier this month more than 400 people signalled that they would join a class action lawsuit against MtGox, according to British law firm Selachii.

It is the latest effort to try to reclaim some of the hundreds of thousands of lost bitcoins from the exchange.##2980|Bill Ackman has had mixed success enlisting the US government in his fight against Herbalife. The hedge-fund manager, who has taken a $1 billion bet against the direct-sales firm he claims is a pyramid scheme, has been lobbying an army of congressmen and other officials to have it investigated. But so far regulators haven’t launched a probe, and Ackman has drawn bad publicity for his attempts to “leverage the corridors of power for his hedge fund’s profit,” as a New York Times investigation recently described it.

Maybe China, Herbalife’s hottest market, will prove more amenable to Ackman’s cause. Chinese officials are already investigating Herbalife’s rival NuSkin to determine whether it is an “illegal pyramid scheme” that brainwashes its local door-to-door sales force. That has led many analysts to question whether other direct-sales firms could also be in their crosshairs.

Ackman certainly has hopes of opening up a China front. His hedge fund paid a research firm, OSG, to investigate the company’s practices in China, and he said on a conference call yesterday (March 11) that Herbalife breaks a number of China’s direct-selling laws, including a ban on making recruits pay an entry fee. (What distinguishes a direct-sales company from a pyramid scheme is generally that it makes revenue from real customers, rather than from its salespeople, who must constantly recruit new ones to keep the money flowing.)

As Quartz has reported, China has long been suspicious of companies like Herbalife because they feared that sprawling sales ranks and corporate fervor could potentially pose a threat to Beijing’s rule. So it’s possible that officials could use OSG’s evidence to crack down on Herbalife, NuSkin, and the rest. Alternatively, Beijing may decide that its age-old distrust of direct sales companies belongs on the dustbin of history, and that Ackman’s argument is tainted by his own financial self-interest in Herbalife’s demise.

Besides, Ackman’s not the only one who knows how to access the corridors of power. Direct-selling pioneer Amway—which has also faced criticisms that it operates like a pyramid scheme—now gets almost 40% of its revenue from China. Since 2002 it has been bringing Chinese communist party officials to Harvard University since 2002, where they study public management as “Amway fellows.” As Bloomberg reported last year, one alumnus “is a former official in the government agency that polices direct selling.”##2981|Singapore: Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in 5-1/2 months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal`s safe-haven appeal.

Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at USD 1,355 an ounce, traders said.

Other precious metals were higher too, with silver climbing nearly 2 percent.

"There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals," said one Hong Kong-based precious metals.

"It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well," he said.

"With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold`s downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets."

Spot gold had gained 0.7 percent to USD 1,358.10 an ounce by 0710 GMT, after earlier hitting USD 1,362.24 - its highest since September 20. The metal gained 0.8 percent on Tuesday.

U.S. gold futures rose over 1 percent to their 5-1/2 month high of USD 1,364.10.

Bullion has gained 13 percent this year following a 28 percent drop in 2013, on escalating uncertainties around the world.

Ukraine`s government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise rule from Moscow within days.

China`s first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world`s second-biggest economy. Copper and iron ore prices have been hit the hardest.

In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock.

PHYSICAL MARKETS

Demand for physical bullion and jewellery has dropped off due to the jump in prices.

In China, the world`s biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about $3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of USD 20.

Pakistan has extended its ban on gold imports to March 31, as it tries to stop smuggling to India where high import duties have made supplies scarce.##2982|Thank you for subscribing!

Dick’s Sporting Goods has sued Modell’s Sporting Goods and its prominent fourth-generation CEO, Mitchell Modell, claiming Modell brazenly visited a Dick’s retail location and impersonated a Dick’s executive to unlawfully gain a competitive advantage.

Building off his 2012 acting performance on the CBS show “Undercover Boss,” where he transformed into his alter ego, rank and file Modell’s employee “Joey Glick”—complete with a shaved head, fake mustache and exaggerated New York accent—Mitchell Modell allegedly appeared at a Dick’s store in Princeton, New Jersey in February and identified himself to the store manager as “Joseph” (perhaps a derivation of Joey Glick?), a Dick’s Senior Vice President. According to the suit, Modell told store management that he was there to meet with Edward Stack, Dick’s Chairman and CEO, and while waiting for this supposed appointment, Modell requested and received access to the store’s private back-room and obtained Dick’s confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets.

The allegedly stolen information includes Dick’s processes and procedures for inventory handling, the planned pricing and quantity of inventory in each store, key store-level metrics and other areas of focus such as overall customer satisfaction scores, the marketing of Dick’s private label credit card program and add-on sales such as warranty programs, and the specific manner in which Dick’s executes at the store level on its omni-channel initiatives such as its “Ship from Store” online fulfillment program.

While it may be considered a good practice for retail executives to visit competitor stores, line to the unlawful. If true, Mitchell Modell impersonating a rival executive to gain access to non-public areas and proprietary information crosses the odell’s actions are rather shocking, particularly given his very public persona (in addition to the “Undercover Boss” appearance, Modell has appeared in the regional sporting goods giant’s well-known “Gotta Go To Mo’s” ad campaign and many other public appearances). Did he not think he’d be recognized?

So what lesson can businesses take away from Modell’s misadventures (aside from, of course, don’t impersonate a rival executive)? Since a key element in a trade secret case is the precautions taken to protect the secrecy of the information, businesses should ensure that they have policies in place restricting access to non-public areas (also a safety issue) and highly sensitive information, and managers and employees must receive training on these policies. By way of example, non-public areas should be locked, employees should be required to carry company-issued photo identification and, most relevant here, local level management should be required to confirm with headquarters any unannounced site visits. We don’t know what protocols Dick’s had in place to prevent a “Joseph” from doing what he did, but at first blush it doesn’t seem like Modell had a particularly difficult time talking his way into the Dick’s store’s non-public areas and accessing sensitive information. But in the spirit of Oscar season, perhaps we can ask whether more acting roles are in his future.##2984|Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced massive hacker offensives last month, coming under some 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report said Sunday.

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.

While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.

Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.

The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said.

MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that the company owned.

Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.

After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.

Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.

US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.

Japanese officials have said they were closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.##2985|We use cookies to give you the best experience on our site.

"The Congress voted to withdraw its confidence in the prime minister by 124 votes," lawmaker Suleiman al-Zubi told news agency AFP. Libya's top prosecutor also imposed a travel ban on Zeidan for his suspected involvement in the embezzlement of public funds, according to a post on his office's Facebook page.

The vote was scheduled by parliamentarians who reacted angrily when a North Korean-flagged tanker laden with an estimated 234,000 barrels of crude oil dodged a naval blockade and escaped to sea. The tanker docked without government permission at the eastern port of al-Sidra, which is controlled by a rebel militia. The region's self-declared autonomous rebel government sold the oil.

Zeidan's government threatened armed action to stop the tanker getting away, with Culture Minister Amin al-Habib saying on Sunday it would be "turned into a pile of metal" if it tried to leave port. The government earlier reported it had siezed the vessel.

But bad weather proved to the tanker's advantage - on Tuesday it moved to the open Mediterranean while Libya's smaller navy craft were forced to stay close to shore. The escape is a major humiliation for Libya's fledgling government, with lawmakers voicing their anger at the failure.

"The situation in the country has become unacceptable. Even those members of parliament who used to support the prime minister no longer have any alternative," lawmaker Suad Gannur told the AFP news agency.

Struggle for control

Authorities in Tripoli have struggled to control much of the country since a revolt in 2011 which led to the downfall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

A multitude of former rebel militias have carved out their own areas of control, particularly in the oil-rich country's east.

The judges has been asked to rule on whether the ESM violated the rights of Germany’s lower house of parliament – the Bundestag – to decide on budgetary matters:

Andreas Vosskuhle, the President of the Federal Constitutional Court, said: “The result is clear. The constitutional complaint is partly inadmissable and apart from that without merit”

More than 35,000 people had complained to the court, included academics and lawmakers of all political stripes.

The judges rejected their argument that the ESM illegally transfered sovereignty from Berlin to Brussels, saying there were sufficient safeguards and limits to Germany’s contributions.

The court stressed that measures had been taken to ensure Germany’s liability to the ESM was limited to 190 billion euros, with any increase subject to approval or veto by the Bundestag.##2991|Empty##2992|Harriet Green

Before dawn this morning, US Navy commandos boarded and took control of a North Korean-flagged tanker loaded with crude oil smuggled out of Libya, the Pentagon has confirmed.

The move foils attempts by a breakaway Libyan militia to sell the cargo, which is owned by the Libyan government’s National Oil Company, on the black market. It’ll now be returned to Libyan authorities.

The oil was loaded on at the rebel-held port of Sidra, where the tanker’s been docked. Local daily al-Wasat report last week that the ship has $36m of crude oil on it.

Sidra is currently under the control of Ibrahim Jadran, the 32-year old warlord with a history in oil.

Libyan prime minister Ali Zeidan had ordered an attack on the North-Korean-flagged tanker, but his failure to stop the activity saw him sacked by the country’s Islamist-led congress last Tuesday; he then fled to Europe.

Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement today that nobody was hurt "when US forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans.”

North Korea has denied providing authorisation for the action. News reports have said it was being operated by a company based in Egypt, and was in the Mediterranean looking for buyers for the oil.

The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Monday that enrollments in Obamacare marketplaces have hit five million. Meaning that with two weeks until a key deadline, the administration is still a million enrollees short of its most recent goal.

Or, put another way: about 48.73 people need to enroll in an Obamacare exchange every minute until April 1 to hit the baseline of 6 million set by the Congressional Budget Office last month.

If you look at the graph of enrollments over time, below, you can see that without a dramatic spike in enrollments, that won't happen. Many people expected the pace of enrollments to pick up as the April 1 deadline approached; if it has picked up much, it has been a subtle increase.

As Russia tightened its grip on Ukraine's Crimea region this month, U.S. and European Union officials were urging the Obama Administration to speed up approvals of more liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals.



Yet Russian exporter Gazprom's ability to swamp European natural gas markets with supply while depressing prices will make it difficult for as-yet unavailable U.S. supplies to displace Russian gas in Europe.



The EU is keen to diversify away from Russian gas imports, a stance hardened by Gazprom's decision to switch off supply to Ukraine during a pricing dispute in 2009 which curtailed supplies to EU member states, as well.



Yet U.S. LNG, exports of which are expected to ramp up beginning next year, are not a silver bullet in supply diversification for Europe.



State-controlled Gazprom sells most of its gas to Europe in long-term deals that are partly linked to the price of oil.



It has recently agreed major price reductions with most of its European customers, including Germany's E.ON and RWE, France's GDF Suez and Italy's ENI and Edison.



The move has helped defend its leading position in Europe, including from potential U.S. shipments, and industry sources say that Russia may agree to further discounts.



U.S. exports to Europe would barely break even at current spot market prices, as operating costs, fees and shipping rates would push the price of U.S. cargoes above European spot levels.



"Prices don't need to go down further to cap new 2020 supply," said Thierry Bros, senior gas analyst at Societe Generale, adding that such a fall would effectively rule out any significant role for American LNG in Europe.



Only a slight drop in Russian long-term prices or a rise in U.S. gas prices would see North American LNG cargoes to Europe pushed out of the market by Russian gas pipelines as well, Reuters research shows.



Asia is Better for LNG

European spot gas prices currently stand at around $10 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), half of what Asian buyers pay. Because U.S. prices are below $5 per mmBtu due to the shale gas production boom, U.S. LNG exports have become attractive.



Although U.S. spot gas prices are low, however, forward curves show prices rising in North America while Europe's contracts come down.



That means even just slight further rebates by Russia or a move towards more EU spot market indexation would effectively push U.S. LNG out of the market in Europe.



"Lower European prices could make U.S. LNG profitable for the Asian market alone," said Thierry Bros.



Political Gas

Although the United States has overtaken Russia as the world's biggest gas producer, there's an important difference in the politics of energy between Washington and Moscow.



Private companies and market mechanisms determine U.S. trade flows, which make it difficult for the United States to wield energy as a tool to punish Moscow. That points to LNG cargoes steering away from Europe towards higher-value Asian and Latin American markets given current price trends.



Not so in Russia, where state-controlled Gazprom granted heavy price discounts to reclaim lost market share.



That policy allowed Russian gas exports to Europe last year to rise to record levels, while LNG suppliers or pipeline competitors like Norway's Statoil saw their European market shares shrink.

##3000|LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Tuesday defended the bank's forward-guidance framework on interest rates, saying it has contributed to the strength of the labor market. In testimony to the Treasury Committee, the BOE chief was asked about his "bait and switch" tactics on forward guidance, in reference to the bank's latest revamp of the framework. Carney explained that the guidance was well understood by businesses, which contributed to the improvement in employment. He argued that it was not a bait-and-switch because the bank was doing exactly what it said it would do. "I have no regrets that we're sitting here in March with more than half a million more people in work," Carney said. The central bank's forward guidance laid out in August linked future interest-rate hikes to the unemployment rate, but after a better-than-expected improvement in the labor market, the bank said in February it would focus on a wider range of indicators.

The amount was not far behind the $2.7 million the state recouped in excise taxes on alcohol in the same period and is expected to exceed that in subsequent months.

More than $14 million worth of the dug was sold over counters to recreational users in the 30 days after cannabis shops opened on Jan 1.

Another $1.5 million in tax was collected from medical sales of the drug, the figures showed.

The total appeared low in comparison with recent estimates from Governor John Hickenlooper’s office that suggested the state should expect $117.8 million in tax revenue from recreational sales in the next fiscal year.

However, only 24 cannabis businesses were open on Jan 1, and 59 by Jan 31. The number has now risen to 167 and will expand further.

Barbara Brohl, head of Colorado’s tax department, said: “The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations. We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts.”

Other US states, and countries around the world, have been closely observing the Colorado experiment which has been described as the world’s first fully regulated recreational cannabis market.

The Netherlands has legal sales of cannabis but does not allow growing or distribution, and Uruguay’s legalisation program is still under development.

In Colorado the first $40 million in tax revenue will go towards school construction and Mr Hickenlooper wants additional revenue to be used for projects including anti-drug advertising aimed at children, campaigns against driving under the influence of cannabis, and public health projects.##3002|Empty##3003|Empty##3004|Empty##3005|Starbucks have announced that next week they will be rolling out a new update to their iOS application in the US, UK and Canada with new features that will enable customers to leave a tip for the Starbucks barista ranging from $.50 to $2 directly from their mobile device.

Life insurance policy one for record books

SAN JOSE, Calif. – An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world’s most valuable life insurance policy.

The San Jose Mercury News reported Saturday that Guinness Book of World Record officials say the $201 million life insurance policy is more than double the previous record set in 1990 by an unidentified “entertainment industry figure.”

A Southern California financial services company who helped put the deal together declined to identify the buyer for safety reasons.

“We don’t want hit men running around Palo Alto trying to find him – or members of his own estate,” quipped Dovi Frances of the Santa Barbara-based SG LLC financial services company.

Frances said the life insurance policy is actually two dozen policies underwritten by 19 different insurers. That’s because no one company could afford to pay the policies’ benefactors when the billionaire died.

Frances wouldn’t disclose the billionaire’s age. Frances said the billionaire purchased the policy to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax.##3008|Empty##3009|George Osborne under pressure to appoint a woman as the Bank's new deputy governor as Charlie Bean retires

George Osborne is today expected to name Charlie Bean’s successor as deputy governor of the Bank of England.



Bean, 60, is scheduled to retire on June 30 and the Chancellor is under pressure to appoint a woman to the £260,000-a-year job.



Those in the frame are thought to include Lucrezia Reichlin, a professor at London Business School who formerly headed the European Central Bank’s research department.

A number of senior officials already at the Bank have also been linked with the job, including chief economist Spencer Dale, executive director for markets Paul Fisher, and Ben Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist who sits on the monetary policy committee.



But the selection of a woman could be a political coup for Osborne on the eve of his fifth Budget as Chancellor. The nine-strong MPC has not included a woman since Kate Barker left in 2010.



There has never been a female governor and there has not been a female deputy governor since Rachel Lomax left in 2008.

##3010|Remarkably, though paying with your mobile phone has been possible for years at Starbucks, tipping with it hasn’t. The coffee giant is finally rectifying that, with an update to its mobile payment service that includes the ability to add a tip; it will roll out on iPhones in the US next week.

The change, says Linda Mills, a company spokeswoman, will apply to Starbucks’ own mobile app, which lets customers pay using the balance on a Starbucks loyalty card, but not to the wallet app from online-payments firm Square, which handles credit and debit-card payments for various retailers, Starbucks among them.

In some ways, the tipping feature will work like it does on other payment services, like Square: Users will be prompted to tip either nothing, $0.50, $1, or $2, at the push of a button. But Starbucks is also doing things a bit differently. Rather than prompting for a tip when you pay, it will instead nudge you with a mobile notification after the fact. “Once you leave, you’ll receive a push notification—or not, if you’ve already disabled that feature,” company spokeswoman Linda Mills told Quartz. There’ll be a two-hour window for adding a tip to the transaction. (Square Wallet already offers a similar window at other retailers.)

This dodges some of the manipulative subtleties inherent in many other services—namely, it doesn’t guilt customers into tipping in front of a server or cashier. That could make tipping more merit-based. It also helps speed things up; customers won’t linger at the counter while contemplating whether to tip or not to tip.

If there’s any worry, it’s that this could lead to a drop-off in tipping. Customers will be able to put off forking over an extra dollar or two until the two-hour window is up, and it’s no longer an option.

Unlike many restaurants, however Starbucks pays its employees more than the minimum wage, which means they aren’t as dependent on tips. That gives Starbucks the leeway to experiment. “This is new for us. It will be interesting to see how customers respond,” Mills said. And Starbucks will, at the very least, have a hefty sample size to cull from. More than 10 million people use its mobile app, which accounts for over 11% of its weekly transactions.##3011|Is your baby a star?

Investing.com - Consumer price inflation in the U.S. rose in line with expectations in February, while prices excluding food and energy costs also inched up modestly, official data showed on Tuesday.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said that consumer prices rose by as a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, matching forecasts, after rising 0.1% in January.

Year-over-year, consumer prices rose at an annualized rate of 1.1% in February, below expectations for 1.2% and down from 1.6% in January.

Consumer prices, excluding food and energy costs, inched up by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, meeting estimates. Core consumer prices rose 0.1% in January.

Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 1.6% in February, unchanged from January and in line with expectations.

Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

Following the release of the data, the U.S. dollar held on to losses against the euro, with rising 0.04% to trade at 1.3928.

Meanwhile, U.S. stock index futures pointed to a higher open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a gain of 0.25%, S&P 500 futures indicated a rise of 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures signaled an increase of 0.2%.##3016|Empty##3017|Doh! 404!

Just imagine a digital currency untethered from government regulators, existing only in the virtual world of computer code and cheaper to use than credit cards.

But the recent collapse of a leading bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, has raised concerns about the legitimacy of this virtual currency.

A $470 million digital heist last month at the Tokyo-based exchange pushed the company into bankruptcy and left many bitcoin investors empty-handed with little recourse.

Mt. Gox chief executive Mark Karpeles offered some hollow condolences during a late February press conference in Tokyo. He basically said, oops, there was a bug in the bitcoin software, which allowed thieves to hack their way into the system and fraudulently withdraw bitcoin.

And to think this was supposedly the precursor to a digital Utopia.

Investors in traditional currencies — U.S. dollar, Japanese yen or Swiss franc — need a cast iron stomach, a savvy trading strategy and a fat wallet because big losses are inevitable.

Breaking news in these markets is like waving a biscuit at a mad dog. It comes fast, and it ain’t pretty.

But at least sovereign governments and regulatory authorities stand behind and monitor traditional currencies. While Bitcoin’s exchange rate is even more volatile than traditional currencies, there is no oversight from the FDIC, Federal Reserve or U.S. Treasury.

Tyler Moore, an SMU assistant professor in computer science and engineering, said he doesn’t believe the Mt. Gox fiasco will spell the demise of bitcoin, but regulatory safeguards are needed. Moore co-authored a research report last year in which he examined the risks of investing in bitcoin.

“The bitcoin ecosystem is in need of regulatory oversight and reform,” he wrote in an email response to my questions. “Bitcoin currency exchanges act like de facto banks. Many customers leave the bitcoins in accounts at the exchanges, but there are no capital requirements as there are for traditional banks.”

This makes bitcoin exchanges vulnerable to withdrawal spikes, otherwise known as bank runs. Moore said the security breach at Mt. Gox wiped out the capital reserves of the exchange. He examined the track record of 40 bitcoin exchanges and found that 18 have closed “with customer account balances often wiped out.”

Bitcoin was supposedly created about five years ago by a computer programming genius named Satoshi Nakamoto — probably a pseudonym. Nakamoto created 31,000 lines of computer code that essentially created bitcoin, according to The New Yorker magazine.

Through this computer program, he set a limit on the amount of Bitcoin that would eventually be available in the system. Only 21 million bitcoins will be created over the next 20 years and currently about 12 million are in virtual circulation, meaning they are held in bitcoin “wallets” inside computers all over the world.

When I last wrote about the bitcoin phenomenon last summer, the exchange rate was $100 for one bitcoin. As it gained popularity it topped $1,100 in December.

But with the bad publicity swirling around Mt. Gox, one bitcoin now fetches about $500. Some 850,000 bitcoins, or about 7 percent of the bitcoins in circulation, were stolen from Mt. Gox.

Moore cited several examples of security breaches at bitcoin exchanges and other frauds. While it didn’t involve an exchange, one of the largest bitcoin Ponzi schemes occurred here in North Texas

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil complaint dated July 23, 2013, that Trendon T. Shavers of McKinney operated a bitcoin denominated Ponzi scheme under the name Bitcoin Savings and Trust.

The SEC is seeking monetary penalties and the return of the ill-gotten gains.

Perhaps the government can get back some of the lost money for investors if in fact this was a Ponzi scheme. But for the long-term stability of bitcoin, or any digital currency for that matter, Moore advocates some kind of mechanism “to reimburse customers for fraudulent transactions.”

An article in The Atlantic probably summed it up best: “No matter how perfect a technological concept is, when it enters the world of human beings, it becomes imperfect. Bitcoin is no exception.”##3022|Empty##3023|Empty##3024|Empty##3025|Empty##3026|Empty##3027|Mt Gox collapse shatters Bitcoin myth of virtual money By Peter Morici

Bitcoin believers were shaken to their digital souls when Mt. Gox, the world’s largest exchange, defaulted on $470 million worth of deposits and closed. The virtual currency was supposed to provide a safer, more private and less costly alternative to money issued by governments, but lacking the imprimatur of a sovereign is failing. Fundamentally, money provides a secure place to keep your wealth—you can store your savings for later use at a government guaranteed bank. And it eliminates the inconvenience of barter—a necessity for even the most rudimentary market economy. Money permits a nightclub singer to buy bread from a baker who gets his music from iTunes. All accept dollars, because the U.S. government declares those to be “legal tender for all debts public and private.” You can do business through barter or some alternative currency. However, workers, suppliers and landlords expect to be paid in dollars, and the IRS will require dollars at tax time for income earned through barter. What gives money its value are the goods and services that may be purchased and taxes paid within the sovereign jurisdiction of the issuing government. The earliest currencies were coins, often with the face of the sovereign stamped on gold or silver to instill confidence. Yet, governments minted coins with non-precious metals, and the Chinese issued paper money more than two thousand years ago. The creators of Bitcoin and advocates of virtual currencies are fixated by the temptation of governments to print too much and destroy its value through inflation. However, inflation is hardly a problem in the United States, Europe and Japan, and central banks in other countries hold dollars, euro and yen to back up their currencies. Bitcoin is created by ordinary folks solving increasingly difficult mathematical problems defined by the virtual currency’s creator, and like gold, is naturally limited in supply. It is stored in virtual wallets on private computers, or deposited at exchanges like Mt. Gox. These function much like commercial banks but are not guaranteed for safety by the FDIC, Federal Reserve and similar regulatory agencies around the world. There is no “Bitland” where a government has declared it legal tender to buy goods and services and pay taxes. Lacking such a tangible connection to the real economy, it is very hard to value day-to-day, never mind next year. Bitcoin traded for $1,117 on December 4, and now commands only about half that amount. It is no place for your children’s college fund or retirement savings. Bitcoin is hardly secure. A hacker can steal it from your digital wallet or an exchange that holds your deposits, just as pirates stole bank debit and credit card numbers from Target. And the government does not stand ready to back up Bitcoin exchanges that lose your money or identity to thieves. A 2013 study found some 45 percent of all Bitcoin exchanges closed, taking their depositors money with them. Bitcoin is supposed to be more private, because unlike commercial banks, its exchanges are not monitored by regulators, and its private payments system charges lower fees than do Visa and MasterCard. However, personal and business transactions can be spied by hackers or government security agencies through its fairly open payments system. The government can subpoena your Bitcoin records or those of your exchange when it needs. Factoring in such risks and potential intrusions, Bitcoin is a lot less private and more expensive to use than advertised. Detractors of paper money have always been fixated by the absence of gold to back it up, but they fail to recognize what really makes a currency accepted and secure—the government guarantee and the good sense of the sovereign not to abuse its franchise. It’s not the gold but the face of Caesar—the promise his image carries—that makes a coin money.

##3028|Comcast: We're Lobbying Congress For You, The People!

There's really no doubt that Comcast has its tendrils in deep when it comes to lobbying for approval of their $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable. The revolving door helps; former FCC boss Michael Powell now heads the NCTA, the cable industry's largest lobbying group. Former FCC Commissioner Meredith Attwell Baker, who voted for Comcast's acquisition of NBC while at the FCC, now lobbies the FCC for Comcast. FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen formerly provided legal counsel for Comcast.

But the company is also throwing money hand over fist at both parties in the hopes that they can quite simply buy merger approval. Comcast PACs have given money to all but three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and nearly all of the folks who'll be responsible with reviewing their merger application.

They've also donated to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, who'll be holding an upcoming merger hearing.

quote: “Comcast NBCUniversal operates in 39 states and has 130,000 employees across the country,” said spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice. “It is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process. The majority of our PAC contributions are to the senators and members who represent our employees and customers."

None of this is particularly surprising, given that this is how a broken democracy works. Whatsurprising is that in defending the practice, Comcast attempts to tell Politico in a roundabout way that they're doing this all for employees (who'll likely see layoffs from duplicate positions) and customers (who are more than certain to see rate hikes either way):That's a Comcast representative trying to claim that because lawmakers technically represent, throwing money at them to support a merger that likely won't help you in the slightest is perfectly ok.##3029|A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an "illegal" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were escorting it to port on Tuesday, MPs said.

Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic and political uncertainty, when the metal is preferred by investors over riskier assets such as equities. It has gained 14 percent so far this year on the global uncertainties.

A recent bond default in China and a weak exports report sent equities and base metals lower. More data on Thursday showed China’s economy slowed markedly in the first two months of the year, with growth in investment, retail sales and factory output all falling to multi-year lows.

Spot gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,371.76 an ounce by 0737 GMT, after jumping 1.3 percent on Wednesday. The metal earlier on Thursday hit $1,374.85, its highest since September 10.

Technical buying has also been supportive of price momentum in the last two sessions, especially after prices cleared a recent high near $1,355 an ounce.

“Given bullion’s technical break, it may be at risk of profit-taking in the near term, barring an escalation of Eastern European tensions,” HSBC analysts said in a note.

“Geopolitical events can have a pronounced, but sometimes short-lived impact on gold.”

Reuters technicals analyst Wang Tao said spot gold faces resistance at $1,375-$1,377, a break above which will open the way towards $1,433.31, the August 28 high.

The biggest factor driving gold prices at the moment is the stand-off between the West and Russia over Ukraine.

The EU agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the drive to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.

New money has been flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds in recent weeks, in a sign of investor confidence, after record outflows last year.

However, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 1.50 tonnes to 811.20 tonnes on Wednesday - the first decline since February 19.

Physical demand has been subdued due to the price rally, with prices in China - the biggest bullion consumer - trading at a discount to spot prices.##3032|Empty##3033|Kuala Lumpur: The co-pilot of a missing Malaysian jetliner spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the airline’s chief executive said on Monday, as investigators consider suicide by the captain or first officer as one possible explanation for the disappearance.

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on 8 March with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

A search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering a area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.

Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane’s automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane—an informal “all right, good night”—was spoken after the system, known as “ACARS”, was shut down.

“Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape,” Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.

That was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19am, as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.

The last transmission from the ACARS system—a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane’s status—had been received at 1.07am, as the plane crossed Malaysia’s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.

“We don’t know when the ACARS was switched off after that,” Ahmad Jauhari said. “It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through.”

Vast search corridors

Police and a multi-national investigation team may never know for sure what happened in the cockpit unless they find the plane, and that in itself is a daunting challenge.

Satellite data suggests it could be anywhere in either of two vast corridors that arc through much of Asia: one stretching north from Laos to the Caspian, the other south from west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra into the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia.

Aviation officials in Pakistan, India, and Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan—as well as Taliban militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan—said they knew nothing about the whereabouts of the plane.

“The idea that the plane flew through Indian airspace for several hours without anyone noticing is bizarre,” a defence ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, who are seeking to oust foreign troops and set up an Islamic state, said the missing plane had nothing to do with them.

“It happened outside Afghanistan and you can see that even countries with very advanced equipment and facilities cannot figure out where it went,” he said. “So we also do not have any information as it is an external issue.

China, which has been vocal in its impatience with Malaysian efforts to find the plane, called on its smaller neighbour to “immediately” expand and clarify the scope of the search. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH370 were Chinese.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had spoken to Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak by telephone, and had offered more surveillance resources in addition to the two P-3C Orion aircraft his country has already committed.

Malaysian acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said diplomatic notes had been sent to all countries along the northern and southern search corridors, requesting radar and satellite information as well as land, sea and air search operations.

The Malaysian navy and air force were also searching the southern corridor, he said, and US P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft were being sent to Perth, in Western Australia, to help scour the ocean.

Focus on crew

The plane’s disappearance has baffled investigators and aviation experts. It vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysian authorities believe that, as the plane crossed the northeast coast and flew across the Gulf of Thailand, someone on board shut off its communications systems and turned west.

That has focused attention on the crew. Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.

Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry, Hishammuddin said: “We are looking at it.” But he added it was only one of the possibilities under investigation.

Police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programmes were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practise flying and landing in different conditions.

A second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group.

“Based on what we have so far, we cannot see the terrorism link here,” he said. “We looked at known terror or extremist groups in Southeast Asia. The links are not there.”

North or south?

Electronic signals between the plane and satellites continued to be exchanged for nearly six hours after MH370 flew out of range of Malaysian military radar off the northwest coast, following a commercial aviation route across the Andaman Sea towards India.

The plane had enough fuel to fly for about 30 minutes after that last satellite communication, Ahmad Jauhari said.

Twenty-six countries are involved in the search, stretching across much of Asia. Three French civil aviation experts involved in the search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic in 2009 arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to help.

A source familiar with official US assessments of satellite data being used to try to find the plane said it was believed most likely it turned south sometime after the last sighting by Malaysian military radar, and may have run out of fuel over the Indian Ocean.

The Malaysian government-controlled New Straits Times on Monday quoted sources close to the investigation as saying data collected was pointing instead towards the northern corridor. Reuters##3034|MILAN — UniCredit SpA reported Tuesday a massive net loss for the fourth quarter, after a giant write-down on the value of past acquisitions and bad loans, as it published a new four-year strategic plan.

The bank UCG, -1.85% UNCFF, -2.13% said its net loss for the fourth quarter was 15 billion euros ($20.79 billion), compared with 553 million euros for the same period of the previous year.

The bank, Italy’s largest lender by assets, opted to set aside 9.3 billion euros to cover bad loans in the fourth quarter, compared with 4.5 billion euros for the same period of the previous year, as it prepares for the review of its asset that the European Central Bank is carrying out before taking over supervision of the continent’s largest lenders.

The bank also wrote down the value of past acquisitions by 9.3 billion euros, which it said led to the full write-down of the goodwill allocated to Italy, Central and Eastern Europe and Austria.

The bank said the remaining goodwill on its balance sheet amounts to 3.5 billion euros, which is broadly in line with its 2004 level.

Gains in most revenue streams were in line with the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

The bank said its board approved a strategic plan that will drive the bank’s activity until 2018. It forecasts a net profit of 6.6 billion euros for 2018.

The firm also is planning to cut 8,500 jobs.

The world's largest fast food chain said global comparable sales decreased by 0.3% last month, as Europe same store sales increased 0.6% while the metric in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region fell 2.6%.

International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan, as well as by a stronger dollar, which makes its food more expensive overseas.

"We are diligently focused on strengthening our performance, however our relatively flat year-to-date global comparable sales will pressure margins in the first quarter," said McDonald's CFO Pete Bensen in a statement announcing the sales figures this morning.

"Looking ahead, we believe that we are taking the right actions to more clearly align with our customers' needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitable growth."

The company said that systemwide sales globally, which includes sales at all restaurants whether operated by McDonald's or its franchisees, would have increased 2.2% if not for the weight of the stronger dollar instead of a 0.6% decline in February.

The burger chain blamed weakness in the U.S. last month, on top of a same store sales drop of 3.3% in January, on "challenging industry dynamics" and the harsh winter weather, while European sales were bolstered by the U.K. and France, mostly offsetting poor performance in Germany.

Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald’s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.

Shares of McDonald's were down 0.3% on Monday morning, at US$95.24, stretching year-to-date losses to almost 2%.##3036|What stocks are you watching? Sign up to get started or log in to see your watchlist. Sign Up Log In

At 1200 AEDT on Monday, the local unit was trading at 90.51 US cents, down from 90.90 cents on Friday.

The currency fell as low as 90.31 US cents during the local session but has since recovered somewhat.

Over the weekend, Russian state-owned company Gazprom increased the pressure on Ukraine's new government by threatening to cut off gas supplies.

But, FXCM currency strategist Ilya Spivak says he doesn't expect problems in Ukraine to have too much of an affect on markets.

"Vested economic and geopolitical interests in Ukraine, from both Russia and the West, should be enough to have cooler heads prevail," he said.

"It is arguably for that reason that Eastern European troubles have not sparked broader emerging market contagion and financial market distress."

Mr Spivak said the Australian dollar should be well supported this week after last week's raft of positive economic data.

He said that data increased the likelihood of a period of interest rate stability and decreased the chances of another cash rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia.

"The fourth-quarter GDP (gross domestic product) report topped economists forecasts, showing the year-on-year growth rate accelerated to 2.8 per cent and marked the highest reading since the three months through December 2012," Mr Spivak said.

"Meanwhile, retail sales unexpectedly jumped 1.2 per cent in January to yield the largest increase in 11 months.

"While an outright interest rate hike is still not being telegraphed over the coming 12 months, a meaningful hawkish shift in the underlying bias for what the RBA's next move will be is clearly perceptible."

Financial markets are broken, dominated by a small clique of corrupt bankers who have subverted the whole meaning of capitalism for their own ends, Bank of England governor Mark Carney indicated this afternoon.

The solution: a new Bank of England deputy governor to reform the way the Bank interacts with markets, make sure key benchmarks like Libor and FX fixings are used for good, and consider new regulations to keep traders in line.

The current three deputy governors receive salaries of around £260,000, not a bad deal for a new deputy who is charged with stopping future scandals.

“What we saw in Libor and what the FCA is investigating in the FX markets around fixes, are symptomatic of a group of individuals in markets who have lost sight of what a real market is, and that is unacceptable,” Carney told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

“Part of the way we ensure the Bank has its rightful place is to help lead the effort to rebalance these markets.”

The governor stressed that making real capitalism work is not just about defending banks but about their customers too, up and down the country.

“The market system is the best way to achieve allocative and dynamic efficiency, but it has to be a real market – not just that there is no market abuse, but that there is fair access to the market and that if you’re acting on behalf of a client that you’re giving them the best terms, equivalent to those you would get yourself,” he said.

And as well as protecting the rest of us, Carney added that these reforms are vital to the future of the Bank of England, too.

“This institution has to be beyond reproach, we have to have the highest standards of integrity,” he told MPs.

“We have to ensure we ruthlessly, relentlessly follow through with this investigation of what happened, that we explain very clearly why, if there were failings, those occurred, and ensure that these do not happen again.”##3041|Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Carney talks about risks in the banking system

Two new deputy governors have been named at the Bank of England, as part of a radical shake-up by governor Mark Carney.

Ben Broadbent will become deputy governor responsible for monetary policy, and Nemat Shafik will take charge of markets and banking.

Both will sit on the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC).

And Andy Haldane, executive director for financial stability, will swap jobs with chief economist Spencer Dale.

There is a bewildering game of musical chairs going on at the Bank of England this morning. And pretty much every big job there, bar the very top one, is changing in some way

The appointments are the first of several changes being made as part of what Mr Carney has said will be a "root-and-branch" review of how the Bank conducts market intelligence, following criticism of its response to claims of manipulation of foreign exchange (forex) rates.

In a speech at Cass Business School Mr Carney set out his vision for the Bank.

He said the financial crisis was a "powerful reminder" that to maintain economic stability the Bank had to do more than just fight inflation.

Initiatives

To do that Mr Carney has set out fifteen initiatives to reshape the Bank.

They include the creation of Ms Shafik's Deputy Governor role to oversee markets and banking.

Also, the responsibilities of the chief economist will be expanded to help improve the Bank's collection of data.

Victoria Cleland has been named as the Director for Banknotes and Chief Cashier, replacing Chris Salmon.

The appointment means Ms Cleland's name will appear on banknotes.

Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said the dramatic changes indicated the extent of the changes Mr Carney planned to make.

"He's serious about making reform, not only to the structure of the Bank... but also in terms of its culture," he said.

'Pretty tough'

Ben Broadbent, who takes over from the retiring Charlie Bean on 1 July, will now be responsible for the Bank's analysis of the UK economy.

Ms Shafik, an International Monetary Fund official, will become the first female MPC member since 2010 when she replaces executive director for markets, Paul Fisher, on 1 August.

She will be in charge of the Bank's eventual exit from its quantitative easing policy, which it has so far used to inject £375bn into the economy by buying government bonds.

Ms Shafik will also lead the Bank's review on its market intelligence, which has come under attack after claims some Bank officials knew about the alleged fixing of foreign exchange rates.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nemat Shafik will take charge of markets and banking

Jonathan Portes, director of Britain's National Institute for Economic and Social Research said that she is a good person to monitor the financial industry.

"She's pretty tough and at the moment you need someone who is prepared to be fairly tough with the London financial sector," he said.

'Well-rounded'

In other changes, Anthony Habgood was named as chairman of the Bank's supervisory body, the Court of Directors, whose role will be to oversee Mr Carney's governance, including the Bank's adherence to official rules on how it operates.

"These appointments result in a well-rounded senior management team at the Bank - one that will set the direction for an ambitious agenda of transformation," said Mr Carney.

BNP Paribas economist David Tinsley said the appointments would add "a degree of raised uncertainty" about when the central bank would start to raise interest rates from their current 0.5% record low.

Mr Carney has also given the Bank a new mission statement: "Promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability."##3042|We're always interested in hearing about news in our community. Let us know what's going on!

Mark Carney will probably face his toughest questioning so far as Bank of England (BoE) governor today when MPs will seize on a foreign exchange scandal to press their demands for tighter oversight of the central bank.

A group of influential MPs has long been frustrated with what they say is the bank’s outdated governance system. The matter boiled up again last week when the BoE suspended an official amid an internal review into whether staff turned a blind eye to possible manipulation of key rates by foreign exchange traders.

The meetings at which the BoE and traders discussed possible problems in the market took place as far back as 2006, seven years before Carney’s arrival in London from Canada.

But MPs are angry that the bank’s governing board asked its oversight committee to investigate only last week.

Carney may also be asked to show how quickly he responded to signs of the case last year.

Mark Garnier, a member of the parliamentary committee that will hear Carney today, said perceptions that the BoE was not tough enough on tackling problems could damage London’s reputation as a financial centre, potentially weakening Britain’s hand in EU talks over financial reforms.

“We will be asking the governor what steps he is taking to bring management arrangements and committee structure up to the standards of the 21st century,” Andrew Love, another member of the treasury committee, said.

There could also be tough questions for another BoE policymaker. Paul Fisher previously chaired the foreign exchange joint standing committee, a forum for BoE officials and market players to discuss market issues.

It was at a sub-group of that committee that dealers raised concerns with BoE officials as early as July 2006 over attempts to move the market around the time of daily benchmark fixings. – Reuters##3044|(Reuters) - King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of hit mobile phone game “Candy Crush Saga”, expects to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga Inc (ZNGA.O), which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.

“Candy Crush,” which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King’s revenue.

Dublin-based King said on Wednesday it expects to price its IPO at $21-$24 per share, valuing it at up to $7.6 billion - slightly higher than Hasbro Inc (HAS.O), the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

“I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock,” said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.

Twitter Inc’s (TWTR.N) successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) shares have fueled speculation that other tech firms could go public, including music-streaming service Spotify, lodging website AirBnB and mobile payments company Square.

However, Schuster and other analysts questioned if King could maintain its breakneck growth rate.

“I think the valuation of a P/E ratio of 13 for a high-growth company is indeed reflecting a scepticism about the ability to continue growing at such a rapid pace,” said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

“The ability to come up with future games and get people to pay for the game is a big question mark.”

Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake in King after the IPO. Zacconi, 47, worked with online dating site uDate.com Ltd till it was bought by InterActive Corp in 2002.

ANOTHER ZYNGA?

“Candy Crush” launched on Facebook in April 2012. The game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.

The game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra “lives”.

Such stellar popularity has helped King’s revenue grow to $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.

But most of that growth was fueled by “Candy Crush” rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.

King, which had 665 employees at December 31, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to $17 billion this year from just $6 billion in 2010.

Zynga’s stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of “Farmville” waned, while Finland’s Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of “Angry Birds”.

Zynga acquired mobile game developer NaturalMotion for $527 million and cut over 300 jobs this year, in an effort to narrow its focus to mobile gaming.

To be sure, King’s revenue for the quarter ended December 31 declined 3 percent from the preceding quarter, which the company said was due to a fall in “Candy Crush” gross bookings.

However, bookings rose for its other games such as “Pet Rescue Saga” and “Farm Heroes Saga”. About 73 percent of total bookings in the quarter came from mobile users.

King's five games for mobiles have drawn a "substantial fan base" Zacconi said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (r.reuters.com/bar57v).

“The opportunity in front of us is exciting: mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion’s share of time spent.”

NYSE DEBUT

King’s IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, two underwriters told Reuters. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KING” on March 26.

Of the 22.2 million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5 million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, King said.

Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.

In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company’s games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

At the top-end of the planned range, the IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million, slightly more than the $500 million placeholder figure it disclosed in its first public filing in February.

Entities related to Apax will own 44.2 percent of the company following the offering, according to the IPO filing.

JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are lead underwriters for the offering.##3045|Empty##3046|Empty##3047|By Mike Sherry

KHI News Service

KANSAS CITY, Kan. — With the deadline fast approaching to get health coverage this year through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace plans, a final push is on across Kansas, Missouri and other states to get people signed up.

“We have stepped up efforts with our outreach activities. Our navigators have jam-packed their schedules, getting appointments made to get people enrolled,” said Katrina McGivern, communications coordinator for the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, one of the Kansas groups given federal grant dollars to help get people enrolled. The association represents Kansas’ various safety net clinics.

KAMU already had billboard advertisements for the Obamacare marketplace up in various parts of the state, but this past weekend also began airing ads in movie theaters. Radio and TV ads also have been airing in the various markets.

The last day of open enrollment is March 31 and most involved with it report that the pace has picked up considerably since the marketplace’s slow start in October 2013. Starting this year, most people who don’t have health insurance but can afford it will face penalties.’Starting to realize’

“I think people are starting to realize the deadline is coming. We’re seeing a lot of people who have never had insurance before. They don’t know about co-pays and deductibles. We’re really working with them from square one,” said Misty Kruger of the Shawnee County Health Agency in Topeka.

The agency hired certified navigators and counselors to help people get enrolled and stationed the workers at the public library, a popular community gathering spot, with hours that extend into the evenings and weekends.

Earlier this month in Kansas City, Kan., organizers held a two-day health fair as part of efforts to get the word out.

Salvador Lopez, an Excelsior Springs, Mo. farm worker, was among those who attended the event. He came with his wife and two daughters.

He said he would like health insurance so he could afford diabetes medicine. The coverage also could help his wife, who said she wasn’t feeling well as she had her blood pressure checked.

Lopez said Medicaid already covers his daughters and he was optimistic he would be able to find a plan he could afford through the new marketplace.

“It’s going to help me a lot,” he said.

“I would say the majority of people that we see have no idea what health insurance is, have never had it,” said Pam Seymour, executive director of Shepherd’s Center Central. The nonprofit has two locations in Kansas City, Mo., and has more than a dozen trained workers to help individuals navigate the enrollment process using the federal website.

Surge expected

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported last that 4.2 million people nationwide had purchased exchange plans through the end of February. The Congressional Budget Office had originally projected that 7 million people would enroll in private plans in the first year of the marketplace. Last month it revised that downward to 6 million.

The latest numbers from HHS included about 104,000 people who were signed up in Missouri and Kansas. According to federal estimates, about 1.1 million people in the two states are uninsured and eligible to participate in the exchange. Nationally, the number of uninsured people in 2012 was estimated at about 47 million.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 6 million people will get coverage through the Obamacare marketplaces this year, about 20 percent less than originally projected.

But officials said they are expecting there will be a flurry of enrollments at or near the deadline.

“What we are finding,” HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said with the release of the new enrollment numbers, “is that as more Americans learn just how affordable marketplace insurance can be, more are signing up.”

A department spokeswoman said agency officials were “busy preparing to handle an anticipated surge in enrollment as we approach the end of March.”

HHS officials said they had hired an additional 2,000 workers for the department’s help line – bringing the total to about 14,000 representatives.

Drafters of the Affordable Care Act intended the health insurance marketplaces to operate much like online systems that allow shoppers to compare prices on airline tickets or hotel rooms. The idea behind that was that competition among plans would yield the best deals for consumers.

There also was the assumption that the marketplace could give individuals the clout of being part of a large group similar to people enrolled in a large, employer-based plan.

Resistance

The health-reform law gave states the option of establishing their own marketplace or participating in a federally run exchange.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 17 states have their own exchanges. The remaining states are relying on the federal marketplace or created a hybrid federal-state operation.

In many instances, as in Missouri and Kansas, the decision not to establish a state exchange stemmed from conservative Republican and/or voter opposition to Obamacare.

In November 2012, Missouri voters approved a proposition barring the governor or any state agency from helping establish an exchange without legislative or voter approval.

Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, a conservative Republican who ran for office campaigning against the health reform law, rejected $31.5 million in federal grant money that would have allowed the state to build its own exchange. He also rejected a plan that would have let the state partner with the federal government on a marketplace, opting instead for one run solely by the national government.

Final push

At the Shepherd’s Center in Kansas City, Seymour said, “everybody is ready and up to the challenge of getting these last-minute people enrolled. We are going to pull out all the stops and do whatever we need to do.”

Shepherd’s Center is among the various groups in Missouri and Kansas that are working to inform people that time is running out to buy insurance for 2014 through the marketplace. The next enrollment period starts in November.

Among the initiatives in the Kansas City metro area are Enroll Wyandotte, the coalition that sponsored the recent health fair, and CoverKC, a $700,000 effort bankrolled by the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City.

The St. Louis-based Missouri Foundation for Health has a statewide project called Cover Missouri.

In Kansas, the state insurance department is working with KAMU and other outside organizations to spread the word about the Obamacare health plans.

Various activities

Here are some of the efforts to date and plans for the next couple of weeks

• Cover Missouri: Has helped enroll about 68,000 Missourians for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, said Ryan Barker, health policy vice president at the Missouri Foundation for Health. That total includes some people who turned out to be eligible for Medicaid. With a multimedia campaign on tap, Barker said he hopes the effort can have 130,000 people enrolled by the end of the month.

• Among KAMU’s efforts is a text messaging campaign. And various KAMU members are running their own ad campaigns and enrollment events, including an “enrollment blitz” scheduled from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Center for Health and Wellness in Wichita. The Wyandotte Health Department will be taking enrollments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the deadline day.

• CoverKC: Since January, workers have knocked on more than 35,000 doors in the urban cores of Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City, Kan., according to Jessica Hembree, program and policy officer for the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City. Organizers said they hope to have knocked at 70,000 doors by the end of this month, supplemented by mail, telephone and digital marketing.

• Enroll Wyandotte workers aim to have reached about 18,000 residents by the end of the month, said Jerry Jones, executive director of the Community Health Council of Wyandotte County. By the end of the next enrollment period, which ends in mid-January, Jones said the goal is to have 12,000 previously uninsured county residents enrolled in plans through the marketplace.

Enrollment workers said the federal website is working much better than it did last fall.

Field workers said it still can take upwards of two, three or five hours to enroll, if the case is complex, but that they are cautiously optimistic the anticipated surge of sign-ups in the next couple of weeks will not lead to another meltdown.

“We hope the process works better,” said Linda Sheppard, special counsel and director of health care policy and analysis at the Kansas Department of Insurance. “I assume it will. We will see what happens.”##3048|Jos. A. Bank Clothiers finally liked the look of Men's Wearhouse's takeover offer as the Hampstead-based retailer accepted a $1.8 billion buyout Tuesday.

The deal would pay Bank's stockholders $65 a share cash, $10 more than Men's Wearhouse initially offered in November, but their gain could mean more job losses in Maryland, where Bank traces its roots to 1905.

The combination of the nation's two biggest men's apparel specialty chains would create a $3.5 billion retail powerhouse with 1,700 stores across the United States and about 23,000 employees that analysts said could compete better with department stores and online sellers.

Men's Wearhouse said it would keep the Jos. A. Bank brand, and Bank terminated its recent agreement to acquire outdoor apparel retailer Eddie Bauer.

The deal ends months of acrimonious tug of war between the two rivals that started when Bank made a surprise $2.3 billion offer to buy Houston-based Men's Wearhouse in September. Spurning Bank's overtures, Men's Wearhouse turned the tables and moved to buy Bank in a series of bids that turned hostile in January.

Leaders of both companies struck much friendlier tones Tuesday after their boards of directors approved the transaction.

Men's Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert said his chain has "great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and is eager to work with Jos. A. Bank's talented employees. Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos. A. Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach."

Bank Chairman Robert N. Wildrick said the retailer's board has been focused on finding a strategic alternative that would maximize value for shareholders.

"The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded," Wildrick said.

Bank's shares rose nearly 4 percent Tuesday, closing at $64.22.

While the higher price is a boon to shareholders, it will bring increased pressure to trim expenses, said Steven Isberg, a finance professor at the University of Baltimore's Merrick School of Business.

"This is a much higher price than originally talked about, and they will not make it back through revenue enhancements," he said.

Isberg said all business processes will be on the table for being eliminated, from back-office operations to the supply chain, including reducing the number of distribution faculties.

"To generate the value they're paying, they're going to have to create some significant cost reductions, more significant than the earlier proposal," he said.

The companies expect expense savings of $100 million to $150 million over three years. The savings are expected to come from more efficient merchandise buying, improved customer service and marketing, and streamlining of corporate functions, they said.

Jos. A. Bank employs about 780 people in Carroll County between its headquarters and three distribution centers, making it the county's fourth-largest employer behind the school system and two hospitals.

It could be months before any decisions are made about the fate of those facilities. Any big changes would be unlikely before the deal closes, which is expected by the third quarter, analysts said.

State economic development officials said Tuesday that it is too early to know how the acquisition might impact Maryland jobs.

"We are hopeful that it will not have an impact and that those jobs will remain in Maryland," said Karen Glenn Hood, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Business and Economic Development. "We just don't have those details."

Consumers probably won't see significant changes.

"There will be no rebranding or remodels required — Jos. A. Bank's store banner will remain in place," the companies said.

Still, the merger could be tricky, analysts said, as the retailer navigates an increasingly competitive retail climate while trying to become more efficient and combine two disparate corporate cultures yet retain brand identity and customer loyalty.

"They speak to two different types of customers," said Christine Carter, president of Baltimore-based Epps Consulting, a retail marketing firm. "Jos. A. Bank has more of a mom-and-pop feel, even though it's national, and more intimate relationships, where Men's Wearhouse comes across as a big box, one-size-fits all retailer. The challenge will be retaining the Jos. A. Bank customers."

A big challenge will be avoiding losing loyal customers who might perceive the merger as eliminating the brand they favor, said Roy DeYoung, senior vice president for Paradysz PM Digital, a New York-based marketing firm.

"There could be some customer apprehension about why are they doing this to my brand?" he said. "They're going to need to make a statement real soon to the customers — why we did the deal, what's in it for you, and join us in celebrating. They don't want an exodus."

DeYoung said that while a combined chain can expect a bigger share of the growing men's apparel market, it still faces stiff competition, not only from traditional department stores but from a growing number of online-only and catalog retailers.

Each chain will benefit from the other's strengths, said Mark Montagna, a senior research analyst with Avondale Partners LLC, a Nashville-based investment bank. Bank will get a boost for its tuxedo rental business, while Men's Wearhouse will get the advantage of lower costs and higher quality in sourcing products.

The deal still must be approved by shareholders and will get an antitrust review.

"It's a slam dunk — shareholders will approve this," Montagna said. "I think it's a good deal. It's a positive for shareholders of both companies."

Montagna said he doubted that the merger would be held up by antitrust issues because the combined company would represent only about 5 percent of the total menswear business.##3049|Why did this happen?

Get all the latest industry news in your inbox. Email address

New York — Dick’s Sporting Goods reported consolidated net income of $138.6 million, for the 13-week period ended Feb. 1. Results also exceeded the company’s performance in last year’s fourth quarter, which had an additional week. For the 14-week period ended Feb. 2, 2013, the company reported consolidated net income of $129.7 million.

The company reported a net sales increase for the quarter of 7.9% to $1.9 billion compared to the prior-year quarter. On a 13-week to 13-week basis, net sales increased 12.5%. Adjusted for the additional week last year’s fourth quarter, consolidated same-store sales increased 7.3% — compared to last year’s increase of 1.2% — although the company was expecting a 3 to 4% increase. Adjusted same-store sales in the quarter for Dick’s Sporting Goods stores increased 7.9% while same-store sales at Golf Galaxy decreased 11.7%. E-commerce penetration for the quarter was 12.2% of total sales.

"We generated strong results in our fourth quarter, with record earnings per share of $1.11, above the upper end of the guidance range we provided in our third quarter press release, as our sales and merchandise margin exceeded our expectations," said chairman and CEO Edward W. Stack. "As we look to 2014, we believe our robust and growing omnichannel network and exciting merchandising opportunities will support double-digit growth in earnings."

In the fourth quarter, the company opened six new Dick’s Sporting Goods stores, one new True Runner store and closed three underperforming Golf Galaxy stores. The company also remodeled one Dick’s Sporting Goods store during the fourth quarter. As of Feb. 1, the company operated 558 Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in 46 states, with approximately 30.1 million sq. ft. and 79 Golf Galaxy stores in 29 states, with approximately 1.4 million sq. ft.

In 2014, the company expects to open approximately 50 Dick’s Sporting Goods stores, relocate six Dick’s Sporting Goods stores and remodel five Dick’s Sporting Goods stores. The company also expects to open approximately eight Field & Stream stores, relocate two Golf Galaxy stores and open one Golf Galaxy store in 2014.##3051|Empty##3052|KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia | Officials dismissed reports Thursday that the missing Malaysian airliner's engines continued sending data for hours after its last contact, but said it was possible the plane continued flying and that they would widen their search farther to the west.

INTERACTIVE: What we know about the crash

The Wall Street Journal newspaper quoted U.S. investigators on Thursday as saying they suspected the Boeing 777 remained in the air for about four hours after its last confirmed contact, citing data from the plane's engines that are automatically transmitted to the ground as part of a routine maintenance program.

Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the government had contacted Boeing and Rolls Royce, the engine manufacturer, and both had said the last engine data was received at 1:07 a.m., before the plane lost contact over the South China Sea on its way to Beijing.

An international search effort is sweeping the South China Sea and also the Strait of Malacca because of unconfirmed military radar sightings indicating the plane may have changed course and headed west after it stopped communicating.

Asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Hishammuddin said, "of course, this is why we have extended the search."

He said the search had been expanded into the Andaman Sea and that the country was asking for radar data from neighboring countries. If the plane flew far from current search areas, then locating it will be a much harder task.

Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the disappearance of the plane and the 239 people on board.

With the end of the Cold War, NATO appeared to be on the road to irrelevancy. But the sunshine has faded. Russia's dismemberment of Ukraine should remind Americans and Europeans that European security, for which all of us paid a high price over the past hundred years, is not assured.

For Europe, the decade before 9/11 was hardly perfect. There were wars in the Balkans, and a civil war against Islamists in Algeria, across the Mediterranean. But Russia appeared to be democratizing. Turkey was moving toward Europe. The Israel-Palestinian peace process seemed to be working. Above all, Eastern Europe was secure and free.

Today, few of those hopes remain. Russia is an authoritarian menace. Turkey is unsure of its regional role. Palestinians have never unambiguously accepted Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. The Arab Spring has toppled old autocrats, and replaced them with new ones, or with violent radicalism.

All of that is bad. But worse, Americans and Europeans alike are operating on the strategy born in the sunny 1990s. We act as though Europe has solved its security problem, as though it has stable and increasingly friendly borders. It does not.

NATO still exists, but a military alliance without a military is a contradiction in terms. European defense budgets have shrunk, reflecting the broader European public distaste for anything that reeks of hard power. Regrettably, most of the world feels differently.

And since the United States no longer has a single Army brigade permanently deployed in Europe, our own commitment has melted away. This is not because of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia. It's because of the gradual U.S. acceptance after 1989 that most of Europe's problems had been solved, and the European Union could be trusted to handle what was left.

The EU's approach was to employ soft power. North Africa would be slowly pushed toward reform by investment and diplomacy, Turkey would be strung along in negotiations about EU membership, and Ukraine would be pulled westward by support for civil society.

But in most cases, the EU's approach didn't work. Turkey tired of the EU's road to nowhere. North Africa didn't reform; it revolted. Ukraine was pulled toward Europe, but the EU's soft power strategy has been crushed by Russia's hard power hammer.

Russia's Vladimir Putin doesn't want to recreate the Soviet empire. He's learned the lesson of its fall: Don't occupy big places, like Poland, that hate your guts. His strategy is subtle: Use a Russian population, or create it by distributing passports, to manufacture grievances, then occupy a little chunk of territory and intimidate the rest. He still has vulnerable neighbors, including the Baltic republics.

This week, the crisis is in Ukraine. But Crimea looks likely to join Kaliningrad, Belarus, Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, Georgia and Chechnya, all of which are either occupied in whole or in part by Russia, or are pseudo states recognized primarily by Russia and its cronies. These conflicts are frozen by Russian power, and too often ignored by the West, which encourages Putin to try again.

So the first job for the United States and Europe is not responding to the Ukrainian crisis, per se. It is to recognize that our strategy for securing Europe from the troubled periphery is broken. These threats do not stem only from Putin, though he creates more than his fair share. Contrary to our hopes, Europe still has a security problem, one that cannot be met by the EU. As in the Cold War, it will take American leadership in NATO, and American recommitment to the security of Europe.##3054|Toyota Kirloskar Motors has declared a lockout at its Bidadi manufacturing facility with effect from March 16 due to labour related issues. The company has issued a press release in this regard which says that the management and union had been discussing the charter of demands for the period FY13-14 for the past 10 months. As a bipartite agreement was not reached, the labour department of the Government of Karnataka conducted seven tripartite meetings in order to reach a settlement. The conciliation efforts of the Labour Department have not yet resulted in an agreement.

The official statement furthers says, “In the meantime, under the instigation of the union, certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days. All these unlawful activities have been detailed in the lock-out notice. With this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel.” However, the workers union has not issued any statement regarding the charter of demands or the lockout.

The Japanese automaker currently manufactuers the Innova MPV, Fortuner SUV, Corolla Altis as well as the Etios and Liva at the plant outside Bengaluru. It locally assembles the Camary and imports the Landcrusier Prado, Prius Hybrid and LC 200 for the Indian market.

Toyota is the second major Japanese automaker to declare a lockout of its plant in the last two years. Maruti Suzuki has faced a similar scenario in 2012 but on a much more violent scale and it is probable that Toyota does not want to see such an incident at its plant. Workers at Maruti Suzuki’s Manesar plant rioted on the evening of August 17 after talks with management over various issues failed. The riots saw 96 people injured and one death resulting in the plant being locked out for a month.##3055|The Sbarro pizza restaurant chain filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, just three weeks after it closed down 40 percent of its locations, mostly in airports, malls and highway rest stops.

Click here for reprint permission.##3056|Empty##3057|Empty##3058|Urban Outfitters‘ (NASDAQ:URBN) Q4 fiscal 2014 revenues increased by 6% to $906 million, but missed expectations of $926 million. While the retailer recorded strong sales growth for its Anthropologie and Free People brand, its namesake business stumbled due to missed fashion calls and severe winters in the U.S. However, Urban Outfitters’ Q4 earnings per share of $0.59 was better than the consensus estimate of $0.56.

In the current environment, U.S. retailers are struggling for growth due to weak consumer spending and fierce competition from fast fashion brands such as Forever 21 and H&M. Considering this, Urban Outfitters’ 1% comparable sales growth looks quite impressive, which was driven by higher e-commerce revenues, average unit retail and units per transactions, partially offset by low store traffic. [ ]

Although the company’s near term growth might be slow as it expects to continue facing challenges with the Urban Outfitters brand, long term outlook is promising. We believe that Urban Outfitters brand will perform better eventually, driven by its several initiatives. Meanwhile, the company has stated that customer response to its other brands, Anthropologie and Free People, has been very strong so far. This indicates that given the right product mix and marketing, these brands can propel Urban Outfitters’ long term growth.

Our price estimate for Urban Outfitters stands at $43, implying a premium of about 15% to the market price. However, we are in the process of updating our model in light of the recent earnings release.

See our complete analysis for Urban Outfitters Inc.

Anthropologie Shows Promise

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Anthropologie registered 10% rise in retail comparable sales driven by its compelling product offerings and store shopping experience. The brand has improved its product mix and designs substantially over the last few quarters, which resulted in double-digit growth in its regular price comparable sales in Q4. Total markdown rate during the fourth quarter decreased by 20% as compared to the same quarter last year, which is very impressive considering that the holiday season of 2013 was more promotional than the holiday season of 2012. Since Anthropologie’s updated theme of sensual and feminine looks has found tremendous acceptance among its customers, we believe the trend is likely to continue. To attract customers and enhance its appeal, the brand also creates engaging story telling techniques through its store windows, visual merchandising and display, along with catalog and email communications. This should assist the brand in driving store traffic going forward.

Apart from its core merchandise offerings, Anthropologie’s new products have also performed very well. During Q4, the brand continued to expand its boutique assortments and it now offers this category in seven Anthropologie stores. Boutique assortment sales increased by 303% in the fourth quarter and the brand plans to expand this category to twelve additional stores in fiscal 2015. [ ] This move adds a new category to the Anthropologie portfolio, which can make a material contribution in the future.

Free People Continues To Surge

Urban Outfitters’ Free People brand has grown at a robust pace over the past few years, which continued in fiscal 2014 as well. The brand’s revenues in fiscal 2014 increased by almost 30% and its comparable sales during the fourth quarter surged by 20%. Moreover, Free People’s international and domestic shop-in-shop expansion resulted in 24% rise in wholesale revenues. Alongside, the brand continued the expansion of its intimate category, where retail sales grew twice as fast as apparel sales. Sales penetration of intimates in wholesale revenues increased by as much as 320 basis points. This indicates that even though U.S. buyers have been reluctant to spend on apparel, they have shown great affinity towards intimate products. Victoria’s Secret’s recent success in the U.S. further confirms this trend. Free People’s footwear category also registered a strong rise of 54% in retail revenues, suggesting that buyers have developed a liking for the brand.

Overall, Free People turned out to be the most productive brand for Urban Outfitters in terms of revenue per square foot in fiscal 2014. Although the brand does not contribute much to the retailer’s revenues at present, it can become a big business in the future if it sustains its healthy growth rate.

Urban Outfitters Can Improve In The Long Run

Urban Outfitters’ namesake brand’s comparable sales declined by 9% during the quarter mainly due to weak response to its fashion and partially on account of adverse weather conditions (450 basis points contribution). The management stated that poor product execution and lack of creativity resulted in the brand’s dismal performance. Although it is unlikely that Urban Outfitters will see a complete turnaround in the first quarter, it will improve eventually as the company is prioritizing the brand’s revival in fiscal 2015. [ ]

Urban Outfitters is elevating its creative functions and restructuring new procedures and communication, into a more central role in order to reconnect with its core customers. During the quarter, Urban Outfitters introduced a new concept named “Without Walls”, which aims to attract young customers with active lifestyle products, placed in an enthralling environment. The concept was recently launched in five stores, where it received tremendous customer response. The retailer is now planning to open three to six such store-in-store locations in fiscal 2015. [ ]

Additionally, the company made significant strides towards the improvement of its supply chain system during the year, which should assist Urban Outfitters’ revival. The retailer lowered its weeks of supply by one week and reduced its lead times by more than 10%. This should help it better adjust to the changing customer preferences. It also reduced direct-to-consumer orders fulfilling time by 30% and shipping time by over 15%, to improve the customer service. We believe that these efforts along with an improvement in design should help the brand’s steady recovery going forward.

The flotation is expected to generate proceeds in excess of $15bn (£9bn), ranking the company’s listing alongside record-breaking IPOs such as Visa, which raised $17.9bn (£10.8bn) in 2008, and Facebook, which took $16bn (£9.6bn) in 2012.

Alibaba, the world’s largest online retailer with over 500 million customers, did not release details of the size or date of the listing, but sources said that it will be in the second half of the year.

The company is in talks with six banks – Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley – for lead underwriting roles, which would yield an estimated $260m (£156m) in fees, a source close to the situation said.

Alibaba said that listing in the US would make it “a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency.”

The announcement ends months of speculation over where the Hangzhou-based group, which is expected to reach a value of $200bn (£120bn) by the end of this year, would hold its IPO.

In September last year, Alibaba indicated that it favoured New York after Hong Kong regulators balked at its proposed structure, which allows a group of partners to nominate the majority of the board of directors.

At the time, Joe Tsai, executive vice chairman, said: “We understand Hong Kong may not want to change its tradition for one company, but we firmly believe that Hong Kong must consider what is needed in order to adapt to future trends and changes.

“The question Hong Kong must address is whether it is ready to look forward as the rest of the world passes it by.”

Last week, the Financial Times reported that Alibaba, which made a net profit of $801m (£482m) in Q3 last year, had stopped engaging with Hong Kong and was “95pc” certain to choose New York for its initial public offering.

In a statement, the company said that it would also consider listing on China’s capital market in future to share its growth with local investors.

The statement continued: “We wish to thank those in Hong Kong who have supported Alibaba Group. We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong and will continue to pay close attention to and support the process of innovation and development of Hong Kong.”

The announcement comes two days after Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter, announced plans for a $500m (£301m) listing in the US.##3060|Empty##3061|Investing in Real Estate

Experts have always considered investing in real estate an outstanding investment. However, the house you live in isn’t necessarily an investment: True real estate investments are typically comprised of buying, holding, fixing and flipping rental properties, forming REITs, handling short-term rentals and more.

When you invest in in real estate, it’s key to keep your emotions out of the equation. You won’t be buying a house that you’re going to live in or pass down to your children, so you need to look at the property simply as a tool that’s going to generate an additional stream of income for you.

One of the best ways to invest in real estate is through buying rental properties. You purchase a home or apartment building —fix it up if you need to — and rent it out. Rental properties allow someone else to pay down your mortgage and then some.

Vodafone will acquire Ono for €7.2bn ($10.03bn, £6bn), including about €3.3bn in debt. Private equity-backed Ono is Vodafone's third acquisition in European fixed-broadband industry in two years.

Vodafone intends to source the acquisition from existing cash and debt.

Shares in the company rose 1.06% as at 8:42 am GMT, following the announcement.

The deal was reached after months of talks with Ono and its private equity owners: Providence Equity Partners, Thomas H Lee Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors and Quadrangle Capital, according to the Financial Times.

"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said Vittorio Colao, Vodafone CEO.

"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said José María Castellano Ríos, chairman of the Ono board.

The acquisition is expected to be part of the company's strategy to enlarge its global footprint after the $120bn sale of US arm to Verizon Wireless.

In September, Vodafone agreed to buy a controlling stake in German cable operator Kabel Deutschland. It had earlier agreed with French telecoms operator Orange to build out fibre networks in Spain – a move which is expected to complement the Ono deal.

Attractive Synergies

Ono is Spain's second-largest provider of broadband internet, pay TV and fixed-line. Vodafone is likely to add extra products to bundled tariffs as well as reduce the cost of its offerings.

"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the past few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market," Colao added.

If that sounds less than super-enthusiastic (what, no exclamation mark?), so be it. Yes, the S&P 500 index hit another record on Friday. But two facts make it hard to uncork the champagne and cut myself a slice of cake. The first is that a very large proportion of Americans haven’t benefited from this five-year-long rally. The second? I’m not confident that this bull market is going to last much longer than many of its predecessors. I certainly doubt whether we’re in the early stages of another 18-year bull market like that we witnessed from 1982 until 2000.

I’d be more likely to celebrate this bull market if it had enriched a larger swath of the country. Data from Lipper and other providers who monitor flows into mutual funds show that until last year, ordinary investors stayed away in droves; they were more likely to keep yanking money out of stock mutual funds. So while the S&P 500 index is up 177.6 percent since the March 9, 2009 bottom (and 208.9 percent if you take dividends into consideration), anyone who delayed investing until last January lost out on most of those gains. Stocks have continued to soar since then – the S&P 500 is up 28.4 percent, and 31.7 percent if you include dividends – but that’s a fraction of what investors could have earned had they been willing and/or able to jump back in the market in 2009.

Of course, ordinary investors had plenty of reasons to stay away. In the wake of the financial crisis, many Americans simply may not have felt financially solvent enough to take more risks with their money. Collectively, they had seen trillions wiped off their net worth as a result of the 40 percent stock market nosedive and the meltdown in real estate values.

At the same time, it’s not easy to follow Warren Buffett’s advice and be greedy when others are fearful, especially when the pain of market losses is so fresh. Consumer confidence – a proxy of sorts for the willingness of investors to take risks – has recovered from the lows seen during the crisis and up until 2009, but it still languishes below its average during non-recessionary periods.

Whatever the reason for the average investor’s reluctance to load up on stocks, it’s clear they haven’t benefitted as much from the market’s run. Yes, the net worth of U.S. households hit a new record of $80.6 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the Federal Reserve — about $12 trillion above where it stood in the spring of 2007, before the financial crisis. Yet the income gap has only widened in recent years: By the time the economic recovery (as distinct from the stock market recovery, which preceded it) finally got going, the top 1 percent of earners collected 93 percent of income gains.

Let’s put to one side the vexing question of whether that’s fair or moral or sustainable. This data suggests that the vast majority of American households likely were less able to take advantage of the stock market’s recovery, even if they had been able to shake off the lingering psychological effects of the events of 2007 to 2009. Corporate profits may have rebounded, justifying the increase in price/earnings multiples and market valuations that we have witnessed – most dramatically during the course of 2013 – but personal earnings and profits didn’t.

By the time individual investors shook off their aversion to stocks and climbed back on the bandwagon, it was already 2013. The lion’s share of the gains had already been captured. Of course, to the extent that those investors already had a toehold in the market in the form of 401(k) investments in mutual funds that owned stocks, they benefited to some extent, but odds are that their risk aversion was mirrored in their choice of 401(k) allocation as well.

The question now is whether the bull market will keep going so that those who arrived late to the party have a chance to capture some more gains going forward. It’s certainly possible, but market fundamentals are less rosy than they have been. The S&P 500 looks relatively pricey, and analysts are calling for relatively unimpressive first-quarter earnings growth. And economic growth is still clouded in uncertainty.

The Federal Reserve is another source of uncertainty. How committed is the Fed to easing up on its bond market purchases and allowing interest rates to drift higher once more? It’s hard to argue that the incredible inflation in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet that accompanied the stock market rally is merely a coincidence; what remains unclear is the degree of willingness on the part of investors to focus on equity market fundamentals when the Fed removes its heavy hand from one side of the scales.

That doesn’t mean that we’re about to careen off the edge of a cliff – clearly, the bull market requires more than just a slow-motion taper on the part of Fed policymakers and pockets of bad news from emerging markets before it bids us sayonara.

It’s worth remembering, however, that if you do feel like celebrating the bull market’s birthday, the safest way to do it may be by ordering up a big dessert after dinner rather than by allocating a lot more of your assets to U.S. stocks. Analysts widely expect that, even if the rally does continue, the path forward may be much bumpier than it has been. Certainly, it will be tough for the broad market to replicate its outstanding gains from last year.

If you haven’t already rebalanced your portfolio in the wake of the 2013 gains, this is probably a great time to do so – and to scour the market for asset classes that are just as much in the doldrums today as U.S. stocks overall were back in the gloomy days of March 2009.

In a statement released by the company last evening, TKM says that the management and union have been discussing the charter of demands for the period FY 13-14 for the past 10 months.

However, an agreement was not reached even after the intervention of the Labor Department of the Government of Karnataka. In the meantime, TKM says that certain sections of its employees have "resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors". This has been ongoing for the past 25 days, says the company.

In a move to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel, TKM has declared a lockout of the premises. Production of cars in both plants have come to a halt now.

Toyota's first plant, established in 1997, began producing cars since December 1999. The plant has an installed capacity of 100,000 units and makes the Innova and Fortuner. TKM's second plant started producing cars in December 2010 and makes the Etios, Etios Liva, Corolla, Camry and Camry Hybrid. The second plant has a capacity of 210,000 units.

[Head to Slideshare if you're unable to view the document above.]##3070|Andy Greenberg just did a piece on Forbes with regards to hackers claiming to have hacked the Mt.Gox servers. The recent bankruptcy of the Bitcoin exchange has many up in arms and some are deciding to get answers on their own. Some of the data released and posted on Reddit has already been taken down. Greenberg reached out to disgraced Mt.Gox C.E.O. Mark Karpeles but has yet to get a reply back.

From the article:

The Bitcoin community has been angrily pressing for details on what the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has described as a massive hacker attack that stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its users’ bitcoins and left the company bankrupt. Mt. Gox’s staff isn’t talking. So another group of hackers say they’ve broken into the company’s servers to provide answers of their own.

On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users. “It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt. Gox has gone offline, delayed trades or suspended withdrawals, events so common that Bitcoin users coined the phrase to be “goxed”–to suffer from Mt. Gox’s technical glitches.##3071|* U.S. equities down as Ukraine tensions build * Weak Chinese export data fuels economic fear, lifts gold * SPDR ETF fund sees 7.5-tonne inflow * Coming up: U.S. Federal Budget Wednesday (Adds comment, second byline, dateline, updates market activities) By Frank Tang and Clara Denina NEW YORK/LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Tuesday as fears of a slowdown in Chinese economic activity and worries about an escalating crisis in Ukraine boosted demand for bullion. Tensions over Ukraine continued to build and with diplomacy at a standstill, European Union governments said they were considering sanctions against Russia if it failed to respond positively to an initiative to calm the crisis. The Ukraine crisis sapped appetite for risk and weighed on U.S. equities, which also boosted gold demand. The precious metal also climbed after China's data showed exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the world's second-largest economy. However, analysts warned of possible gold losses if geopolitical tensions ease and U.S. economy recovers. "If the Russian situation can be contained and U.S. data continues to hold in, gold will turn into an excellent short opportunity once again, with specs likely to flip back from long to short quite quickly," said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. Spot gold was up 0.7 percent at $1,346.70 an ounce by 2:35 p.m. EDT (1835 GMT), having earlier reached $1,352.50, near a four-month high. U.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery settled up $5.20 at $1,346.70 an ounce, with volume about 10 percent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed. The confrontation around the Black Sea peninsula showed no sign of easing on Tuesday, a day after pro-Russian forces opened fire in seizing a Ukrainian military base in Crimea and NATO announced reconnaissance flights along its eastern frontiers. "There is still a good deal of safe-haven bidding in the market on Ukraine and any possible Russian response, and that's helping get beyond that crucial $1,350 technical and psychological level," Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said. ETF INFLOWS In a sign confidence in the precious metal may be returning amid global uncertainties, the world's biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund saw its largest inflow in a month. SPDR Gold Trust said holdings rose 7.50 tonnes to 812.70 tonnes on Monday, the biggest inflow since Feb. 13. Among other precious metals, platinum was down 1.1 percent at $1,457.80 an ounce, while palladium fell 0.9 percent to $765.90 an ounce.

Sens. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a joint press release that they would release legislative text in coming days that would closely mirror an existing bill sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators on the committee, led by Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Bob Corker, R-Tenn.

Both bills would wind down and eliminate the mortgage behemoths Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were taken into federal conservatorship after failing in 2008 and have remained in the government's control since. In recent months, the two companies have returned to profitability, so far yielding the government more in dividends than the $187.5 billion it cost to bail them out.

Both Senate measures would establish a Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation, modeled on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that provides depositors' insurance for banks. The FMIC would provide insurance on approved mortgage-backed securities that would only kick in once the private owners of those securities had suffered some losses. The FMIC would be intended to ensure a liquid market for mortgage securities while avoiding taxpayer losses on guaranteed loans.

The Johnson-Crapo plan would eliminate federal housing affordability goals in favor of housing funds taken from FMIC user fees and provide a securitization platform that would allow for standardized mortgage securities without Fannie and Freddie's influence.

Fannie and Freddie do not issue loans but buy mortgages from lenders and package them into guaranteed securities to sell to investors. In recent years, following the collapse of the housing bubble, Fannie- and Freddie-backed mortgages have accounted for as much as two-thirds of all new home loans.

The details of the differences between the Johnson-Crapo plan and the Warner-Corker plan are not yet known, but it was widely expected that, as chairman and ranking member, the two senators would want to put their own stamps on the legislation that would likely prove to be at the center of congressional debate in the years ahead. Although the political atmosphere is thought to preclude action on housing finance reform during the current Congress, lobbyists and housing activists have suggested that the bipartisan Senate bill will likely be the vehicle for reform in the medium-term.

Originally, Johnson and Crapo had said that they hoped to introduce their own measure in 2013. But the drama surrounding the government shutdown and the debt ceiling interrupted their schedule.

Although it is not actively involved in the push for housing finance reform, the White House has signaled support for the basic outline of the Senate bipartisan bill. President Obama said last year that the Corker-Warner principles were "consistent" with his own.

But House Republicans are not on the same page. The House Financial Services Committee, led by Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, last year approved a bill to wind down Fannie and Freddie and remove the government's involvement in backstopping mortgage-backed securities. Instead, that legislation involved a privately run utility that would have standardized mortgage products without involving a guarantee. The federal government would retain a role in subsidizing mortgages only through the Federal Housing Administration, which insures loans for low-income home buyers. The House Republican bill would relax the FHA’s requirements during a downturn, to allow it to play a countercyclical role.

That bill, which is opposed by homebuilders' groups, has not advanced in the House, nor does it have support in the Senate.

Hensarling issued a statement Tuesday in which he thanked Johnson and Crapo for working to end the "unacceptable" status quo. But he also said that he is "skeptical" of any plan that does not end government guarantees in secondary mortgage market, warning that the bill could "perpetuate the cycle of boom, bust and bailout we tragically just witnessed."##3073|Empty##3074|The debacle surrounding Mt. Gox continues to rumble on as CEO Mark Karpeles remains silent following his application for bankruptcy at the end of last month.

Over the weekend hackers released information they claim shows Karpeles continues to lie about the amount of bitcoin stolen from the exchange, however the continuing uncertainty over what exactly happened at Mt. Gox doesn't seem to have impacted the value of cryptocurrencies in general.

According to stats from CoinMarketCap.com, bitcoin's value rose 3% in the last 24 hours to $640, continuing to show resilience in the face of the Mt. Gox uncertainty. While the cryptocurrency is still some way off its high of $1,200, it is proving some naysayers wrong by remaining relatively stable in the face of widespread upheaval.

Bitcoin's relative stability has buoyed the rest of the cryptocurrency market, with 11 of the top 15 mineable cryptocurrencies showing a rise in value in the last day.

The big winner however was the eco-focused mintcoin which rose some 30% in value in the last 24 hours.

Hackers claim Mt. Gox CEO Karpeles is lying

Over the weekend hackers posted account transaction information from beleaguered Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, claiming CEO Mark Karpeles was lying about the amount of bitcoins the company had before it filed for bankruptcy.

The stolen information claims to show a ledger balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which is over 100,000 more than Karpeles claimed was stolen from his exchange when he filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.

The hackers attacked the personal blog of Karpeles, called "Magical Tux in Japan - Geekness brought me to Japan!" and posted the stolen information there.

Karpeles is remaining silent about the accusations for now.

The bitcoin-friendly gunstore

The reputation of bitcoin was for years hampered by its connection to illicit marketplaces on the dark web - such as Silk Road - where you could anonymously buy everything from drugs to machine guns.

Now one businessman is looking to get remove that stigma by allowing people to purchase guns using bitcoin directly in its store. The firearm shop and training centre Central Texas Gunworks , based in Austin, has installed a bitcoin ATM to allow those wishing to purchase a gun using the cryptocurrency to do so.

However, unlike on the dark web, you won't be able to buy any firearms anonymously as the same paperwork and background checks required of anyone will still apply. Even online buyers can only have firearms shipped to a nearby gun store where the same legal process applies.

Dogecoin on BitPay before Litecoin

According to a comment from the CEO of Bitcoin payment processor startup BitPay, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin could be the next virtual currency accepted on the platform – even before the world's second biggest cryptocurrency litecoin.

Reddit user and dogecoin enthusiast jimmy0x52 claims to have spoken to CEO of BitPay Tony Gallippi at music, film, and interactive conference SXSW which is taking place in Texas this week. Gallippi is reported to have said:

"Think about the consumer - if they have LTC [litecoin] they have BTC [bitcoin]. Doge is really popular and a whole new marketplace currency"

This is contrary to a tweet from BitPay in February, when it said: "Competition among cryptocurrency is important, but we do not currently have plans to accept Dogecoin. Much currency, such persistence. Wow."

BitPay has yet to officially confirm its plans for accepting other cryptocurrencies, but with more than 10,000 bitcoin-accepting merchants on its books, the addition of dogecoin to a platform like BitPay could be huge for the young cryptocurrency.##3075|American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) ended a partnership agreement that allowed passengers to purchase connections from each other’s carrier.

Based on the statement of the American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL), its customers will no longer earn miles or points when travelling on eligible routes operated by JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) and vice versa effective April 1.

“All American AAdvantage miles or JetBlue TrueBlue points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and are not affected,” according to the statement. The two the airlines are working together to make sure that the change will have little impact on travelers.

American Airlines’s February traffic results

In separate announcement, American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) announced that its total revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 0.5% to $15.1 billion in February.

According to the airline’s operators, its total capacity available seat miles (ASMs) increased 0.8% to 19.2 billion and its total passenger load factor was 78.4% for the month.

Flight cancellations

American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) said severe weather conditions significantly affected its operations in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. in February. During the month, the airlines operator cancelled 14,000 flights, an increase of 149% compared last year.

During the first two months of 2014, American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) cancelled around 28,000 flights, up by 164%.

The company expects to deliver strong unit revenue despite the weather-related challenges, and estimated that its 2014 PRASM for the first quarter will be approximately around 2% to 4% compared in the previous quarter a year earlier.

American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) is the holding company for American Airlines and US Airways.

Washington — A small, four-rotor drone hovered over Washington Nationals players for a few days during spring training in Florida last month, taking publicity photos impossible for a human photographer to capture. But no one got the Federal Aviation Administration’s permission first.



“No, we didn’t get it cleared, but we don’t get our pop flies cleared either and those go higher than this thing did,” a team official said when contacted by The Associated Press. The drone flights ceased the next day. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be named.



The agency bars commercial use of drones no matter how seemingly benign. The lone exception is an oil company that has been granted permission to fly drones over the Arctic Ocean, and it took an act of Congress to win that concession.



FAA officials say rules to address the special safety challenges associated with unmanned aircraft need to be in place before they can share the sky with manned aircraft. The agency has worked on those regulations for the past decade and is still months and possibly years away from issuing final rules for small drones, which are defined as those weighing less than 55 pounds. Rules for larger drones are even further off.



But tempting technology and an eager marketplace are outrunning the aviation agency’s best intentions. Photographers, real estate agents, moviemakers and others are hurrying to embrace the technology. Drones have been used to photograph the two apartment buildings that collapsed in New York City this past week and a car crash in Connecticut. The AP, in fact, is one of several news organizations studying the possible use of drones.



Unless FAA officials receive a complaint or chance upon a news story that mentions drone flights, they have little ability to find out about violations. The ban was further undercut this month when a federal judge dismissed the only fine the FAA has imposed on a commercial drone operator. The judge said the agency can’t enforce regulations that don’t exist.



The FAA, which contends it controls access to the national air space, has appealed.



The use of commercial drones, most of them small, is starting to spread to countries where authorities have decided the aircraft presents little threat if operators follow a few safety rules.



The drone industry and some members of Congress are worried the United States will be one of the last countries, rather than one of the first, to gain the economic benefits of the technology.



“We don’t have the luxury of waiting another 20 years,” said Paul McDuffee, vice president of drone-maker Insitu of Bingen, Wash., a subsidiary of Boeing. “This industry is exploding. It’s getting to the point where it may end up happening with or without the FAA’s blessing.”



In Japan, the Yamaha Motor Company’s RMAX helicopter drones have been spraying crops for 20 years. The radio-controlled drones weighing 140 pounds are cheaper than hiring a plane and are able to more precisely apply fertilizers and pesticides. They fly closer to the ground and their backwash enables the spray to reach the underside of leaves.



The helicopters went into use five years ago in South Korea and last year in Australia.



Television networks use drones to cover cricket matches in Australia. Zookal, a Sydney company that rents textbooks to college students, plans to begin delivering books via drones later this year. The United Arab Emirates has a project underway to see whether government documents like driver’s licenses, identity cards and permits can be delivered using small drones.



In the United Kingdom, energy companies use drones to check the undersides of oil platforms for corrosion and repairs, and real estate agents use them to shoot videos of pricey properties. In a publicity stunt last June, a Domino’s Pizza franchise in the U.K. posted a YouTube video of a “DomiCopter” drone flying over fields, trees and homes to deliver two pizzas.



But when Lakemaid Beer tried to use a drone to deliver six-packs to ice fishermen on a frozen lake in Minnesota, the FAA grounded the brewskis.



Andreas Raptopoulous, CEO of Matternet in Menlo Park, Calif., predicts that in the near term, there will be more extensive use of drones in impoverished countries than in wealthier nations such as the U.S.



He sees a market for drones to deliver medicines and other critical, small packaged goods to the 1 billion people around the globe who don’t have year-round access to roads.



Later this year, Matternet plans to start selling to government and aid organizations a package that includes a drone and two landing pads. On the return trip, the drones can carry blood samples bound for labs and other packages.



Germany’s express delivery company Deutsche Post DHL is testing a “Paketkopter” drone that could be used to deliver small, urgently needed goods in hard-to-reach places. Facebook is in talks to buy Titan Aerospace, a maker of solar-powered drone-like satellites, to step up its efforts to provide Internet access to remote parts of the world.



There is also a strong business case for urban drones that can replace truck deliveries of single packages.



“If you look at the economic footprint and CO2 emissions,” Raptopoulous said, the drone “beats the truck hands down.”



Worldwide sales of military and civilian drones will reach an estimated $89 billion over the next decade, according to the Teal Group, an aerospace research company in Fairfax, Va. The FAA estimates as many as 7,500 small commercial drones will be in use within five years once the necessary regulations are in place.



Jim Williams, head of the FAA’s drone office, said writing rules for the U.S. is more complex than other nations. The U.S. has far more air traffic than anywhere else and a greater variety of aircraft, from hot air balloons and old-fashioned barnstormers to the most sophisticated airliners and military and business jets. At low altitudes, the concern is a small drone could collide with a helicopter or small plane flown by a recreational pilot.



“It’s a different culture in the U.S. and Canada,” Williams said in an interview. “People believe they have the right to just jump in their airplane and fly just like they do their car. ... We can’t set up a system that puts any of those folks at risk.”



Yet the FAA permits hobbyists to fly model aircraft that have so improved in technology that they’re little different from small drones. The FAA has issued voluntary guidelines for hobbyists, including staying away from airports, flying no higher than 400 feet and staying within the line of sight of the operator.



“You could go off to the hobby shop, buy a little remote control helicopter and fly it to your heart’s content,” McDuffee said. “But if you hung a digital camera on that, took pictures of your neighbor’s roof and sold those pictures to him or her, now you are in business and you’re flying” an unmanned aircraft system.



Sean Cassidy, senior vice president at the Air Line Pilots Association, said he worries that commercial drone users will be less willing than hobbyists to abide by restrictions because of economic pressures.



Drones are “becoming so prevalent and affordable that something has to be done to make sure they’re not being used in a reckless manner,” he, said. “Even a fairly small (drone), if the person flying this thing is unaware of their surroundings ... there could be very dire consequences.”

When the enrollment deadline for the Affordable Care Act rolls around, I will be one of the millions of Americans who hasn’t signed up. If it were entitled the Affordable Insurance Act it would at least bear an honest name. And as laudable as it may be to make health insurance more affordable, it has very little to do with health care.

The health insurance industry sucks billions of “health care” dollars from Americans without providing a single service that is health restorative in any sense. If anything, insurance costs, hassles and inadequacies should only be seen as exacerbating factors in dealing with problems of bad health. These billions of dollars, if not being used to generate profits as well as administering parameters and limits to health care, could be available to pay for the care itself. Some of it could stay in our pockets.

People claim that this arcane insurance gateway to health care system stems from our mistrust in government and our love for free enterprise. No matter that in one industrialized country after another, single payer health care systems are successfully taking care of peoples’ health at a much lower cost than we pay in America.

Our history is a free-for-all of healers of all stripes advertising their cures. While medical practices have ranged wildly over the spectrum, they shared one common quality; whether a quack or a surgeon, medical practitioners have mostly operated for profit. As a result many a poor American has perished from not being able to afford medical treatment. Instead of stepping in as a polis and understanding that a healthy life for everyone is necessary for a nation to thrive, we allowed the free enterprise system to intrude instead, creating a for-profit labyrinth of bureaucracies that served a majority of the public (good enough for private contractor work) while leaving a large minority without adequate access to health care.

Is there a risk to living without insurance? Of course there is. Even though the odds are in my favor (that’s where those insurance profits come from) and I’ve made it this far, an accident or sickness could leave me with an enormous bill to pay.

Even if the subsidies in the ACA offered me a chance to enroll relatively cheaply, I wouldn’t do so any more than I would spend medium amounts of money on anything that I didn’t like or didn’t believe in.

Call me old fashioned, but I’m also not willing to sally forth to Vermont Health Connect and give some website contractor all of the personal data that is required to determine eligibility for the ACA. When a government or industry spokesperson assures us the latest data breach probably won’t do any harm, it rings with the same false bravado that accompanies every declaration about “safe” radiation leaks that pose no threat to public health. I don’t bank or manage any of my affairs online. I rarely purchase anything online and I don’t share personal information, medical or otherwise, with anyone online. As I get by well enough without these Internet services, I’m less inclined to be sanguine about the possible cost of a hack attack or the loss of private data.

Is there a risk to living without insurance? Of course there is. Even though the odds are in my favor (that’s where those insurance profits come from) and I’ve made it this far, an accident or sickness could leave me with an enormous bill to pay. At that point, I’d be making monthly payments just like I would for insurance, but it would be paying for a service (even if an over-priced one.)

I am waiting instead for single payer health care to come to Vermont as planned by 2017. Some assert that IT problems with Vermont Health Connect are a harbinger of the disaster that single payer will surely be. But the current website and its problems should not bear have much bearing on Vermont’s eventual single payer system. We are already connected for single payer in that the state has already figured out how to reach us each year with a tax form. I’m happy to let the Legislature and the governor hash out what taxes will need to be raised to pay for providing health care in the state. And I’ll welcome the inevitable rise in taxes that I will face. Since I don’t pay for health insurance coverage, I will see an increase in taxes without a commensurate decrease in insurance premium rates.

But as much I am adamant in refusing to pay insurance premiums, I will have no problem in paying a hefty tax rise knowing that the money is paying for actual health care for all Vermonters. I have a debt to society in being part of it. I have no interest in being indebted to insurance corporations.##3084|The falling out between Bill Gross and his one-time partner Mohamed El-Erian has quickly turned into one of the ugliest bust-ups in recent history.

El-Erian stunned markets when he abruptly resigned as CEO of asset manager Pimco in January. Soon, reports emerged of tensions between him and Gross, the chief investment officer long revered for his prowess in the bond markets.

Those tensions came to a head Thursday when Gross told Reuters he had been monitoring El-Erian's phone calls and that El-Erian was trying to "undermine" him.

The tension over Gross's relationship with El-Erian has been exacerbated by his performance of late. In recent months Gross's flagship Total Return Fund has lagged most of its peers.

After losing nearly 2 percent in 2013-one of the strongest market years in history-some question whether Gross has lost his touch.

El-Erian has thus far been largely silent on Gross's claims. Many have speculated about his next move-US government service, or perhaps some sort of public position in his native Egypt.

Pimco's usually active Twitter account has been silent on the spat so far Friday morning. (Pimco emailed Reuters a statement in which it said: "Mr. Gross did not make the statements Reuters attributes to him.")

That hasn't stopped others, though, from commenting on the unusual spat.

Despite weakness in Asian markets, a sense of relief in Europe that tensions between Russia and the West over Crimea had not escalated buoyed shares in early trading, though there was no escape from the undercurrent of unease.

European shares faded through the morning and were back in the red as U.S. trading loomed, and the continued weakness in the DAX and big German firms that sell to Russia offset gains by Portuguese, Italian and Spanish stocks.

Merger activity in France helped the CAC 40, but mining firms sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials weighed on London’s FTSE 100 as commodities and related currencies lost altitude.

“People sold on Friday on fear of an escalation in Crimea, but things seem to have stabilized now so it’s tempting to buy the dip,” said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled 18% year-on-year in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy.

It put an immediate dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report.

China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest in nearly nine months, copper – of which China is the biggest consumer — hit an eight-month low, while the commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars also suffered.

For emerging markets Chinese gloom added more strain, compounding worries over the U.S. turning off the taps on the cheap money that has been flowing to them.

Emerging stocks fell 1% and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan posted its biggest fall in more than a month as it lost 1.4%. Tokyo’s Nikkei shed 1% as Japanese GDP figures also disappointed.

UKRAINE

Wall Street was expected to dip about 0.2% when trading resumes. The S&P 500 hit its latest all-time high on Friday, underscoring how recent market jitters have driven investors back into more predictable economies.

Part of the attraction is that central banks such as the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England have promised to keep interest rates down for as long as they can.

There was a shot across the bows for that tactic over the weekend, however, from the central bank of central banks, the Bank of International Settlements, warning it raised “the risk of an unhealthy accumulation of financial imbalances”.

China’s export woes also cast a cloud over currency markets.

The yuan fell as much as 0.5% and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China’s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.

The Australian and Canadian dollars, which are highly sensitive to China’s fortunes, lost as much as half a percent, while the dollar and Russia’s rouble were both steady amid the lull in Ukraine.

The euro was steady at $1.3882 after hitting a 2-1/2 year high peak on Friday. Rate cut bets have been significantly scaled back since the ECB suggested last week that the eurozone recovery was on track.

Focus was turning to a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday in Brussels over plans to wind down troubled banks. It will comes alongside more details on the ECB’s stress tests of the banking sector.

COPPER SUFFERS

Gold edged lower for a second straight session after the strong U.S. jobs data on Friday eased fears of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal’s safe-haven appeal.

However, the crisis in Ukraine was likely to remain a crucial factor. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week to their highest in more than a year.

The Chinese data helped send Brent and U.S. crude oil down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two straight days of gains.

The biggest blow came in copper, however, as it hit an eight-month low of $6,608 a tonne and Shanghai contracts dropped by the 5% daily limit. As well as the weak export data, there were also fears about copper finance deals after China’s first domestic bond default last week.

“Clearly there’s an unwind of positioning in the credit markets in China, and as a result of that, copper which was being held as collateral against that credit is no longer required,” Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at Marex Spectron, said.

London shares were flat on Tuesday as banking shares dropped after Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned of a scandal from alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets.

The benchmark FTSE 100 index shed 3.93 points to end the day at 6,685.52 points.

"A bounce in Chinese equities after yesterday?s rout wasn't enough to convince UK markets this morning, with equities selling off," said Toby Morris, trader at CMC Markets.

"The Ukraine situation continues to rumble with no conclusion which doesn't help sentiment."

Ukraine's Crimea peninsula on Tuesday voted for full independence ahead of a referendum to join Russia, while France threatened sanctions against Moscow as early as this week.

The latest escalation of Europe's worst crisis for decades came moments after Ukraine's ousted pro-Kremlin leader Viktor Yanukovych defiantly vowed to return to Kiev from Russia and declared he was still the leader of the ex-Soviet country.

"The possibility of a war is forcing dealers to remain on the sidelines," said David Madden, market analyst at traders IG.

Carney said the potential repercussions of alleged fixing of currency values could be "as serious as" the Libor rate rigging scandal that rocked the financial sector.

"This is extremely serious... this is as serious as Libor, if not more so," Carney told a panel of MPs amid the forex investigation.

Canadian national Carney was grilled over the case after the Bank of England last week said it had suspended a worker following a review of its processes triggered by a probe into the suspected forex rigging.

At the time, the BoE said that it had found no evidence that staff colluded in the alleged manipulation of the global forex trades, 40 percent of which are conducted in London.

Banking shares fell as investors feared the possibility of more huge fines for the troubled sector.

State-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland sank 3.00 percent to 310.20 pence, Barclays fell 2.42 percent to 236.15 pence and Lloyds lost 0.48 percent to 81.11 pence.

Specialty chemical maker Johnson Mathey shed 2.89 percent to 3,096 pence and miner Antofagasta dropped 2.15 percent to 840 pence.

Sports Direct led the gainers, jumping 3.58 percent to 838 pence after news of a bonus scheme for the sportswear group's founder Mike Ashley, dealers said.

Sports Direct called a shareholders' meeting for next month at its Derbyshire headquarters to stage a vote on an incentive scheme worth an estimated £67 million to Ashley, the company's main shareholder as well as owner of Newcastle United football club.

"This reflected the fact that Mike Ashley had received no remuneration for his substantial contribution to the company since its initial public offering in February 2007," Sports Direct said in a statement.

"Since September 2012, the company's market capitalisation has increased from less than £2 billion to approximately £5 billion. The board believes that Mike Ashley is central to this value creation," the company said.

Investors were impressed by Sports Direct's assurance that Ashley will only get the bonus if EBITDA profits reach £330 million this year and £410 million next year.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group climbed 2.52 percent to 444 pence and insurer Aviva rose 2.75 percent to 523.50 pence.

The Morning Glory, which docked in al-Sidra on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.

The central government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorization of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.

But members of the General National Congress, Libya's highest political authority, said that bad weather prevented the navy's small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean.

"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow," one GNC member told Agence France Presse.

Abdelkader Houili, who sits on the GNC's energy committee, told al-Nabaa television that the navy's warships, which mainly consist of fast patrol boats, had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.

The Morning Glory's escape is a new humiliation for the Tripoli authorities who have been battling to assert control over much of the country since the NATO-backed 2011 revolt that ended the 42-year autocratic rule of Moammar Gadhafi.

In eastern Libya in particular, a myriad of former rebel militias, Islamist as well as regionalist, have carved out their own fiefdoms.

There have been almost daily attacks on security and other government personnel in the region's main towns.

Former rebels calling for the restoration of the autonomy that Cyrenaica enjoyed for the first 12 years after Libyan independence in 1951, seized control of eastern export terminals last July.

They have made several attempts to export crude through their own oil company but the Morning Glory is the first to have successfully taken on crude.

"We are not demanding the breakup of the country," the head of the federalists' self-declared autonomous government, Abdrabbuh al-Barassi, said on Saturday.

"The oil revenues would be split between the three autonomous regions," he said, promising that all sales would be carried out with complete transparency.

But Washington said on Sunday that it was "deeply concerned" over the loading of "illicitly obtained" oil.

"This action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the Libyan people," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

"The oil belongs to the Libyan National Oil Company and its joint venture partners."

Warships had deployed to block the Morning Glory after Culture Minister Amin al-Habib warned on Sunday the tanker would be "turned into a pile of metal" if it tried to leave port.

The GNC said a task force composed of both regular troops and ex-rebel militia was being formed to bring the rebel ports back under central government control within a week.

But analysts warned that any resort to force risked plunging Libya back into civil war and wreaking major damage to the country's key oil infrastructure.

The standoff between the Tripoli authorities and the eastern rebels has already slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels per day to just 250,000, dealing a massive blow to the North African country's key revenue earner.

The simmering tensions in Libya helped push up oil markets Tuesday with New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in April, gaining 19 cents to $101.31 a barrel.

"Libya continues to support prices as well, with the threat to sink a North Korean tanker if it loads oil from a rebel held port being taken seriously in the markets," said analyst Joe Conlan at energy consultancy Inenco.##3100|Empty##3101|For Starbucks baristas, there was always one reason to resent ringing up a customer with with a Starbucks app or credit card: they couldn’t add a tip.

Representative Chris Kelly (D-Columbia) tells the House Committee on Crime Prevention and Public Safety, he once opposed the legalization of marijuana. He says it was during his time as a Boone County Associate Circuit Judge that he began to change his mind.

“I changed kind of gradually,” says Kelly. “I saw too many young people whose lives were ruined by convictions for small amounts of marijuana.”

Kelly’s bill would make legal the possession of up to a pound of usable or solid marijuana and up to 72 ounces of marijuana in liquid form. It would create a system for licensing growers and retailers and for taxing the sale of pot, while exempting those who grow their own in limited amounts.

It is the by-products that interested some parents who testified, including Heidi Rayl. She tells the committee Kelly’s bill would allow her to make a compound to treat her son, Zayden.

“He’s four years old and has a genetic condition that is very rare called MCSZ,” Rayl testified. She says the disorder has many symptoms, the most severe of which is intractable epilepsy. “I look at my son’s suffering and it breaks my heart that I can’t fix it. I can’t fix his boo-boo.”

Three law enforcement officer associations testified against the proposal.

Jason Grellner with the Missouri Narcotics Officers Association tells a House Committee the state should proceed slowly with the pursuit of medical applications of marijuana.

He argues one of the unforseen consequences of marijuana legalization in other states has involved children getting a hold of products made with THC, the primary psychoactive agent in marijuana.

“When we have individuals that are making brownies, carrot cake, cookies, peanut butter, granola bars, ice cream … how’s a child supposed to know the difference between a brownie that isn’t infused with THC and one that is?” Grellner asks the committee. “You have marketing of ring pops, of marijuana and THC-infused sodas with pictures of horses and apes.”

Michael Halford with the Troopers’ Association shares the concern that because legalization would make marijuana more available, it would result in more children getting their hands on it.

Halford asks the committee to consider, “We’ve failed the children in keeping alcohol and tobacco out of their hands. How are we going to actually keep marijuana out of their hands?”

The committee has not held a vote on the proposal.

The company behind the compulsively addictive cellphone game Candy Crush Saga is expected to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it starts publicly trading later this month. Turns out that getting people to spend their subway rides moving three same-colored candies into a row is a very lucrative industry.

Talks of an IPO were first heard last June, but as Aman Shah and Neha Dimri report for Reuters, King Digital Entertainment Plc are looking to capitalize on a strong demand for technology investments. Facebook's recent $16 billion purchase of mobile messaging app WhatsApp and Twitter’s successful IPO in November have boosted confidence — but just don't mention Zynga.

Shah and Dimri also report that the King IPO could prompt other technology companies, many of whom are known for their “disruptive” ethos, including Spotify, AirBnB, and Square, the payments company, to go public sooner rather than later.

King Digital, who announced they were going public in February, has 180 games in 14 languages for Facebook, mobile platforms and their website. But its main draw is Candy Crush, which was the most downloaded free app of 2013 and has been downloaded more than 500 million times since it launched in 2012.##3105|Empty##3106|The Malaysian ambassador to China has received confirmation from the Malaysian military that it detected a rogue jet just an hour after flight MH370 vanished - but denied rumours it was shot down.

Iskandar Sarudin, confronted by the frustrated families of Chinese passengers, called up a military source to dispel rumours on social media that the aircraft was shot down - and that it could have been the Beijing-bound flight.

Sarudin was bombarded by questions from concerned relatives at a Malaysia Airlines briefing at Beijing's Lido Hotel.

Watch: Malaysia says hunt for jet not in disarray

The military confirmed spotting the unidentified aircraft on its radar about an hour and 20 minutes after MH370's signal went cold on Saturday, the ambassador said.

A Malaysia Airlines representative at the same briefing said the military had not determined if it was the missing plane.

The ambassador was quoted as saying the military official had said the rogue aircraft was not deemed a threat, otherwise it would have notified its response teams.

The press was barred from the briefing, but some Chinese correspondents managed to get accounts and pictures from the event. They posted these on their newspapers' microblogs.

The families also asked about the mental health of the pilots, Captain Zaharie Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. Shah had more than 18,300 hours of flight experience, while Hamid had 2,800 hours.

Malaysia Airlines said its investigation of the crew had not brought up anything unusual.

The airline representative also shed some light on the mystery of the continuing connection to some MH370 passengers' mobile phones. He said that at least two numbers could be reached and that the ringtones could be heard when dialled, but no one picked up.

But Malaysia Airlines said they had yet to confirm if the calls were actually connecting to the phones or if they were being redirected to telecom providers' servers.

Asked if the military radar had not been fully activated, the airline representative said the military could not track flight MH370's signal after it vanished from civil aviation radar.

Accounts described the meeting as tense. The aggrieved relatives stopped the officials proceeding to a media briefing until their questions were answered.##3107|Stocks drifted to a slightly lower finish Monday as investors sifted through a blend of discouraging economic data from China and Japan as well as ongoing uncertainty over Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.

Major market indexes pared their losses as the day drew to a close, aided by some high-flying stocks including Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Chiquita Brands International and Southwest Airlines.

In the absence of U.S. economic data, investors focused on news that China’s exports slumped 18 percent in February. The report reinforced fears about the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy.

In addition, Japan reported a record current account deficit for January and lowered its economic growth estimate for the October-December quarter to 0.7 percent from 1 percent.

The reports made for a downbeat start for the market as investors seized the moment to recalibrate their stock holdings.

“It was a little bit of an excuse to take some money off the table,” said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. “We have geopolitical uncertainty, so (it’s) a good excuse to re-evaluate your risk exposure. It’s going to be par for the course for this year.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index edged down 0.87 of a point to close at 1,877.17. It had been down 11 points earlier.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418.68. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.77 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.45.

The three major U.S. indexes are still up for the month, and only the Dow is down for the year. The S&P 500 ended Monday up 1.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq finished up 3.8 percent.

The downbeat economic report from China hurt several industry sectors heavily reliant on Chinese economic growth, in particular, materials, energy and industrials. Six of the 10 sectors of the S&P 500 index ended lower, led by industrials. Mining company Cliffs Natural Resources was among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500, shedding 70 cents, or 3.8 percent to $17.95.

“The market is growing more pessimistic around growth in China,” said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management. “Expectations have been coming down, but the numbers have been disappointing even those reduced expectations.”

Despite the disappointing data from China, some market watchers anticipate that last week’s gains will continue.

The S&P 500 index notched record highs three times last week as investors grew more confident that weak U.S. economic reports in recent weeks were a reflection of unusually severe winter weather, not a broad economic slowdown. Better-than-expected payroll numbers last week also helped encourage investors.

“In general, I think the market will move past the poor China export numbers fairly quickly,” said James Liu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. “There’s still a lot of fundamental support for the S&P at this particular range.”

Chalupnik also anticipates Monday’s decline isn’t telling of the market’s trajectory for the week ahead, barring more fallout from Russia’s deployment of troops in Ukraine.

“My guess is the market moves ever so slightly higher this week,” he said. “The trend is still up. We really haven’t seen anything to break that trend.”

Monday marked the fifth anniversary of the current bull market in stocks.

Share##3108|Empty##3109|NEW YORK — Sbarro has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization for the second time in just three years as the pizza chain struggles to turn its business around amid a drop in traffic at shopping mall food courts.

The bankruptcy filing on Monday comes after the company shuttered 155 of its U.S. locations last month. The Melville, N.Y., company still has about 800 locations globally, half of those in North America.

Additional Photos A customer looks at pizzas at a Sbarro restaurant in San Jose, Calif. The pizza and pasta chain says it is filing for bankruptcy reorganization protection after an effort to revitalize the chain’s image with new recipes and ovens apparently didn’t work. The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store →

The pizza chain isn’t alone in hurting from the decline in traffic at shopping malls. Earlier this year, the owner of Hot Dot on a Stick also filed for bankruptcy protection, citing the negative impact from the trend.

There is one Sbarro location in Maine, at the Kennebunk Travel Plaza at Mile 25 on Interstate 95. There previously were locations at both the Maine Mall and Bangor Mall, but both have shuttered.

Sbarro is working to balance out its portfolio of mall-based stores with a new concept called “Pizza Cucinova” that lets people build their own pizzas, company spokesman Jonathan Dedmon said in an email. There are two locations of the new restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, and a third planned for Cincinnati in the summer, Dedmon said.

Sbarro is also trying to update its image for serving re-heated pizza at a time when people are increasingly reaching for foods they feel are fresh and wholesome. Dedmon said the chain has been “emphasizing freshness and quality” of its pizza.

Sbarro first filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain’s image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn’t take hold.

The company says its latest strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will slash debt by more than 80 percent and improve its profitability. It said its filing is designed to “allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy” as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.

The minutes did not say that any violations of compliance were endorsed.



Carney's questioning by politicians about the issue is a further blow for the bank after public criticism of its role in the scandal surrounding the rigging of the key bank rate LIBOR.



The global banking sector's reputation is now undergoing another battering amid global investigations into foreign exchange markets following reports that traders were colluding to manipulate the daily foreign exchange rates.

The Treasury Select Committee's Chair Andrew Tyrie has expressed concern about the speed with which the Bank of England's Court of Directors – which is responsible for managing its affairs – responded to concerns.



The court asked its Oversight Committee to investigate the allegations just last week – despite concerns dating back to last October "or possibly earlier," according to Tyrie.



"The Bank of England's foreign exchange dealers seem to have had knowledge that there was manipulation going on, but this wasn't passed on to the regulator – despite the bank being a member of the regulation community," committee member Mark Garnier MP told CNBC. "We need to get to the bottom of how this break down occurred."



Garnier stressed that London's reputation as "the center of the world for financial services" was at risk – which is especially important given the ongoing overhaul in regulation across the world.



"There is a huge amount of change to financial regulation going on at the moment, and we want to be leaders in this change," he said. "If we now discover a problem with a prime regulator's (the Bank of England) conduct, this will this damage our input in the world's regulatory change."

Carney took over at the Bank of England in the summer of 2013, years before the alleged currency market manipulation took place. Allegations that bank officials knew first surfaced months ago, however, so there are likely to be questions asked about why he did not immediately order an inquiry.



"This situation tests the mettle of an individual. He has to demonstrate that he is taking control of this situation and convince everyone – including the international forex market - that he's doing the right thing," Garnier added.##3112|Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption CMC Markets' senior analyst Michael Hewson: "If Vodafone is to survive... it really needs to take on fixed line infrastructure"

Vodafone has agreed to buy Spanish cable operator Ono for 7.2bn euros ($10bn; £6bn), in deal aimed at expanding its interests in Europe.

Ono, which is private equity-owned, offers cable TV and internet services and has 1.9 million customers in Spain.

Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao said the deal was "an attractive value creation opportunity".

The deal comes just six months after Vodafone bought a controlling stake in German cable operator Kabel.

Vodafone has said it plans to spend up to £25bn of the £84bn it generated from the sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless on investment in its core European networks.

Before the Vodafone deal, Ono's private equity owners had been planning to float the company on the Madrid stock exchange.

Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of Ono's board of directors, said the enlarged business would help to "drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry".

Peregrine & Black analyst Markus Huber said the deal would put Vodafone in a better position to compete with rivals such as Telefonica and Orange.

"It follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general, which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services," he added.

Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor, agreed the purchase was a "shrewd strategic move" for Vodafone, noting that the deal would provide it with the fixed-line operation it currently lacked in Spain.##3113|* Spain, Portugal, Ireland sales growth in double digits

* Toyota, GM, Ford, Renault lead February’s increase

* French auto sales dip 1.4 pct; Germany’s underperform

By Agnieszka Flak

MILAN, March 18 (Reuters) - European car sales rose 7.6 percent in February, as a gradual economic recovery in Portugal, Spain and Italy boosted demand for mass-market brands, industry data showed on Tuesday.

New passenger-car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association trading bloc rose for the sixth straight month to 894,730 vehicles in February from 831,371 in February a year ago, according to data from the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA).

Europe’s car industry endured a six-year slump, with auto sales falling to a two-decade low, as austerity-hit consumers cut back on expensive purchases. Now the market is starting to grow again.

“As the year progresses, we would expect the car market continuing to pick up because the economy is starting to move in the right direction,” said Jonathon Poskitt, head of European forecasting for LMC Automotive. Selling rates in western Europe clawed their way back to mid-2012 levels, he said.

“People are going to feel more confident to make that big-ticket purchase, such as a car, that they’ve been holding off on because of the concerns over their employment prospects and their income,” he said.

At the Geneva auto show earlier this month, executives said they were encouraged by the recovery in crisis-hit European countries, although they were worried that volatile emerging markets could overshadow the gains.

Registrations in Germany, the top car market, underperformed the regional trend, with a 4.3 percent increase, and fell by 1.4 percent in Europe’s second-biggest car market, France. But sales grew by double digits in some states most hit by the crisis.

Sales grew 17.8 percent in Spain, 40.2 percent in Portugal and 20.6 percent in Ireland, signalling that a fragile recovery in the region was gaining strength. In Italy, the region’s fourth-biggest market, sales grew 8.6 percent as the country recovers from its longest recession in 70 years.

“We keep forecasting an ongoing improvement of the underlying sales trend,” ISI Group said in a note. “In addition, we keep highlighting improved vehicle pricing in tandem with better residual values and sales channel mix.”

Sales at Renault Group jumped 11.5 percent, boosted mainly by a 33.6 percent surge in registrations of its no-frills Dacia brand. Ford sales were up 11.3 percent. Toyota Group, the world’s biggest-selling car maker, posted a 14 percent increase, and General Motors saw sales go up 12.3 percent, boosted by a 15.6 percent increase in registrations of its Opel- and Vauxhall-branded vehicles.

Germany’s Volkswagen group, Europe’s biggest carmaker by volume, posted a 7.2 percent rise, helped by a 21.5 increase at its value brand Skoda, a 15.7 percent jump in Seat sales and an 11.8 percent gain at its premium brand, Audi. VW’s performance was weighed down by a 0.8 percent decline in sales at its namesake brand.

French carmaker PSA lost some market share in February. Its overall sales grew 3.5 percent, supported by an increase in registrations of its Peugeot brand, but sales of Citroen-branded cars were roughly flat year-on-year.

The long-awaited revival of the European market seems to be on track, with almost all countries and manufacturers performing better. But industry players urge caution, pointing out the gain comes from historic lows. In Italy, for example, car sales are recovering from levels last seen in the 1970s.

“Sales have effectively been growing, but discounting practices have been following a very similar path, it seems,” Carlos Da Silva, an analyst with market researchers IHS Automotive, said in a note. “This would tend to indicate that the overall situation remains more tense than it might appear.”##3114|(Newser) – President Obama had little trouble garnering young people's support for his election—but when it comes to youth backing for the Affordable Care Act, it's a different story. Young enrollees are essential to the functioning of ObamaCare, but as of the end of February, just 1.08 million had signed up, the White House says. That's 25% of total enrollees; the administration needs the figure to be 40%, it has said. "If the proportion doesn’t improve significantly, the result likely will be fatal for the Affordable Care Act," writes Dana Milbank in the Washington Post.

Why have young people become detached from the Obama presidency? Milbank has some theories. For one thing, they were "disillusioned" by the lack of a "public option" in health care reform. And more broadly, millenials have an "inability … to remain attached to a cause. The generation that brought Obama to power is connected online but has no loyalty to institutions"—like political parties, unions, churches, and the White House, Milbank writes. "The organizational structure they’re growing up in is so weak," says an expert on young people's civic involvement. "There aren’t very many durable institutions that can capitalize on their enthusiasm. They’re being asked to do it themselves, online, and it’s a tall order." Click for the full piece.

##3115|Empty##3116|Bitcoin has spurred interest in virtual currencies, which have the ability to revolutionize our world. But governments and regulators will have the last word on bitcoin’s future prospects.

After a year of wild price swings–from $13.50 per coin in January 2013 to $1,242 in November and now back to around $500–and the recent closure of Mt. Gox in Japan, until recently bitcoin’s largest exchange, the bitcoin currency system looks far too volatile to become a universal currency any time soon. However, some economists and venture capitalists believe that a digital monetary system has enough practical advantages that sooner or later, your money may be even more virtual than it is now. What is the future of bitcoin?

Invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of an unknown cryptographer, bitcoin is an ingenious peer-to-peer payment system that enables people to make transactions without any recourse to a government-issued currency.

But like the ones and zeros that make up the binary language of the digital world, the views of what that future might look like tend to run toward extremes. On the con side, science fiction writer and economic blogger Charles Stross imagines that a bitcoin economy would starve government services by reducing government’s ability to tax, make it easier to trade all kinds of illegal things, and in the end, make “a sub-Saharan kleptocracy look like a socialist utopia”.

Bitcoin boosters, on the other hand, see it as a key technology in building a more prosperous world in which capital moves with less friction, individuals are completely free to make their own economic choices, and money is no longer a government monopoly. As one bitcoin site puts it, “No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.”

Bitcoin Pluses and Minuses

If the advantages and the disadvantages sound quite similar, that’s no accident. Many of bitcoin’s most committed supporters have a Libertarian bent, and argue that apart from a few limited functions, the world could be run better if people were left largely to their own devices.

A world dominated by a digital, non-state currency, would be “a world of strong privacy,” says David D. Friedman, a law professor at Santa Clara University in California and son of the late free market economist Milton Friedman.

Strong privacy would share many of the characteristics of the old Swiss bank system that enabled people to hold assets anonymously–a good thing say, if you’re trying to escape from the Nazis, but not so good if you’re a citizen in a developing country trying to find your country’s vanished oil revenues.

Taxation would be more difficult in a world of strong privacy. “It’s really hard to tax something you can’t see,” Friedman says. It would also be a lot more difficult to watch what people are doing.

One possible preview of the dark side of that future came in November, when the US Justice Department disclosed the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht, the alleged founder of Silk Road, a kind of underworld eBay, in San Francisco. Prosecutors allege that the secret website had made it possible for people to buy and sell drugs, arms, and a variety of illicit services, all with bitcoins.

It would also make it more difficult for governments to clamp down on organizations for ideological reasons. Eli Dourado, a research fellow at the technology policy program of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, says a virtual currency would also make it a lot harder for governments stop organizations they don’t like. Wikileaks, for instance, was starved of funds because the US government made it impossible for people to donate money to the controversial group.

Bitcoin could lead to considerable disruption in the financial world as well. For example, bitcoin could be a boon for migrant workers, who now must spend a considerable part of their income simply sending their hard-earned money home. Migrant workers send more than $500 billion home a year, according to World Bank figures, and currently pay high fees on those remittances: a 2010 United Nations report noted that they pay as much as $18 on a $200 transfer by Western Union or the other two leading operators.

However, as radical as some of these changes might sound, Dourado argues that people have overlooked even more revolutionary implications of bitcoin. “I think bitcoin is actually a kind of base-layer protocol in the same way that TCP/IP is for the internet,” he says.

“Bitcoin is programmable money,” Dourado explains. As a ledger-based system, a bitcoin could be attached to some real property. For example, a single bitcoin might be tied to a title deed, making it possible to buy a car without ever meeting the seller. Or it might be programmed to perform an if-then statement, he says, making it possible to create Kickstarter-like but entirely decentralized markets.

Dourado’s view isn’t unique. Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, has argued in the New York Times that bitcoin is at a similar stage of development to the personal computer in 1975 or the internet in 1993, and represents “a sweeping vista of opportunity”.

Andreessen and number of other Silicon Valley venture capitalists are already trying to stake claims in that sweeping vista. In 2013, venture capitalists invested $74 million in 40 bitcoin-related ventures, $50 million of that in the fourth quarter, according to CB Insights, a venture capital data analytics firm.

Bigger players may be trying to get in on this virtual gold rush as well. In December, eBay filed a patent application for something that sounds a lot like electronic money and could be sent by one person to another, “a Gift Token… that can be limited to use at a specified store, a specified group of stores, or a specified chain of stores. The token can be limited to use in purchasing a specified product.” Tokens could also be limited geographically, according to the application, to a particular city or region.

Not-so-Brave New World

But whether bitcoin itself is part of that digital monetary future remains to be seen. Enough legal problems have already cropped up that the new currency could end up being the Napster of digital money–the pioneer that paves the way for a more government-friendly alternative. It has been especially difficult for bitcoin in China.



Government officials in Europe and elsewhere won’t sit back forever if the use of digital money grows, predicts Robert Pargac, Director of Global Investigations and Compliance for Navigant Consulting in New York. Should the value of bitcoins remain volatile, regulators could ultimately classify them as a type of commodity, he says.

“If [bitcoin proponents] really want a secretive, anonymous, free-floating market-driven virtual currency that’s not regulated, that’s simply not going to happen,” says Pargac. “It’s not going to be good for the consumer, it won’t be good for the economy and regulators and law enforcement will not permit it. They will find it and they will close it down.”##3117|Empty##3118|##3119|Can a gaming company built on the back of one gigantic hit be worth 80 percent of gaming titan Electronic Arts? Candy Crush maker King Digital thinks so.

King revealed in an SEC filing on Wednesday that it and its current shareholders are looking to raise a combined $532 million in its imminent IPO, which would value the Dublin, Ireland-based company at around $7.6 billion. At that valuation, King would be worth about four-fifths of Electronic Arts, which has a market cap of $9.3 billion, and 1.6x of one-time gaming darling Zynga.

King is selling 15.5 million shares in the offering, while its current shareholders are offering an additional 6.7 million shares. Each share is expected to be valued at between $21 and $24, meaning King could bring in as much as $372 million at the top end of the range.

The company, which also produces games like Pet Heroes Saga and Farm Heroes Saga, posted profits of $568 million in 2013 on revenue of $1.88 million billion. But its reliance on the success of Candy Crush — 78 percent of revenue came from the one game — is a potential problem, as is the fact revenue fell to $602 million in the fourth quarter from $621 million in the prior quarter.

Still, Candy Crush’s daily active user count rose from 93 million in December to 97 million in February, according to the new filing.

Upon completion of the IPO, private equity fund Apax will own 44.8 percent of outstanding shares, while Index Ventures will hold 7.8 percent.##3120|In the last week of February, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged concern over the strength of the economy in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. If you assumed that one of the nation's top economic officials expressing doubts about economic growth would be unsettling to the stock market, you would be wrong.

In love with low interest rates

Stocks instead rallied on news of Yellen's testimony -- such is the upside-down logic of stock prices and interest rates.

The reason the stock market liked Yellen's comments was that it raised the possibility that the Fed would slow the tapering of its quantitative easing program, thereby holding long-term interest rates down for a while longer.

Low rates can be stimulative. Low interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money, and thus easier to spend. However, whether Fed policy has succeeded in stimulating the economy is a matter of some debate. The Bureau of Economic Advisors recently downgraded its estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 to a real annual rate of 2.4 percent. This is quite a drop from the original estimate of 3.2 percent, and an even bigger plunge from the third quarter's growth rate of 4.1 percent. Once again, the economy has failed to sustain any momentum. Low rates make stocks look good by comparison. Technically, this has to do with using a lower interest rate to discount the value of future earnings. More intuitively, any investor can relate to the fact that low rates drive people toward the stock market. Savings account rates are near zero, and Treasury bond yields are less than 4 percent. Among conventional asset classes, stocks are the only option offering a solid chance for growth and beating inflation.

Yield comparison

The market has two reasons to applaud low interest rates:

The relative attractiveness of stocks is illustrated when you look at stocks in terms of yield. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 is about 2 percent -- certainly much better savings account rates and even most long-term CD rates , though not as high as long bond yields. However, since stocks do not pay out all of their earnings, stock analysts generally look at earnings yield (essentially, the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) more than dividend yield in valuing stocks.

Currently, the earnings yield on stocks is 5.7 percent, much higher than bank rates or bond yields. At the end of the 1990s, the earnings yield on stocks was 3.3 percent. At the time, 30-year Treasury yields were about 6.4 percent; today Treasury yields are down around 3.8 percent.##3121|Empty##3122|Washington - US Navy SEALs boarded and took control of an oil tanker late on Sunday that had been seized earlier this month at a Libyan port by three armed men, the US Department of Defence said.

“The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra,” his statement said. - Reuters##3123|The United States along with allied governments is considering the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. It is a strategy that trails skeptical question marks. The historical record tells us that sanctions rarely are effective. They can cause much pain and suffering but do not change the policies of governments as intended. From Japan before Pearl Harbor to Cold War China, to North Korea, Iraq and Iran in more recent times, their ineffectualness has been demonstrated. South Africa is the exception -- as were the conditions there.

The willfulness of states to act in accordance with their self-defined basic interests is the main reason for the recurrent failure of sanctions. This is especially true of authoritarian regimes that have the means to contain social unrest. There also are economic factors at work. The essential nature of economic relations is that they are the expression of the parties' mutual interests (except in the case of slavery or other forms of coerced employment). That is to say, they entail mutual gain - even if the benefits are unequal or asymmetrical and leave one party feeling the outcomes as unfair. Trade dealings certainly fall within this category. And it is on matters of trade that American policy currently is focused. For it is far harder to impose curbs on financial transactions, e.g. freezing assets or denying access to banking facilities. The latter require near unanimity among countries where financial institutions are chartered. Already, we have learned that Great Britain has decided to resist the proposed imposition of financial sanctions out of fear for their impact on the City of London which is the foundation stone of the British economy.

Commodity trade with Russia is the center of attention - for obvious reasons. The Russian economy is heavily dependent on the export of natural resources, oil and natural gas above all. They provide the bulk of the country's foreign exchange earnings, employ a large fraction of the nation's industrial workers, and are the main source of the state's tax revenues. The numbers paint a striking portrait o the Russian economy.

Russia is the second-largest producer of dry natural gas and third-largest liquid fuels producer in the world; oil and gas revenues account for more than 50% of the federal budget revenues. Russia's economic growth continues to be driven by energy exports, given its high oil and gas production and the elevated prices for those commodities. Oil and gas revenues accounted for 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports in 2012, according to PFC Energy. Russia was the world's third-largest producer of oil (after Saudi Arabia and the United States) Preliminary data for 2013 show that Russia still is the third-ranked producer of total liquids, with average production at 10.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) through September 2013. Russia was the second-largest producer of natural gas in 2012 (second to the United States).

Russia has roughly 7.2 million bbl/d of total liquid fuels available for export. The large majority of Russian exports (84%) went to European countries, particularly Germany, Netherlands, and Poland. Around 18% of Russia's oil exports were destined for Asia, while the remainder went mostly to the Americas. Russia's crude oil exports to North America and South America have been largely displaced by increases in crude oil production in the United States and Canada. More than 80% of Russia's oil is exported via the Transneft pipeline system, and the remainder is shipped via rail and on vessels that load at independently-owned terminals.

Russia also exports fairly sizeable volumes of oil products. Russia exported about 1.2 million bbl/d of fuel oil and an additional 889,000 bbl/d of diesel in 2012. It exported smaller volumes of gasoline (52,000 bbl/d) and liquefied petroleum gas (56,000 bbl/d) during the same year.

Natural gas exports

Russia sends about 76% of its natural gas exports to customers in Western Europe, with Germany, Turkey, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom receiving the bulk of them. Smaller volumes of natural gas are also shipped via the Gazprom pipeline network to Austria, Finland, and Greece.

Europe is Russia's main energy export market. 75% goes to Western Europe, with Germany being the biggest importer, while 24% goes to Eastern Europe. Fully 25% of the European Union members' total natural gas consumption is met by Russia. This energy symbiosis dates from the early 1980s when the EU and the then Soviet Union entered into a collaborate project to construct a natural gas pipeline. Early on, the project figured in a major diplomatic dispute. In the wake of the Kremlin inspired crackdown on Poland's Solidarity movement, the United States' urged its suspension as a way to penalize Moscow. Western European governments united in opposition to the American plan. They argued forcefully that the criticality of Russian natural gas to their economies meant that disruption or prolonged delay would severely hamper growth. Moreover, a primary justification for the collaborative deal was to reduce the degree of energy dependence on the turbulent Middle East. The economic pain inflicted by the 1973-74 embargo on oil sales by the Arab members of OPEC at the time of the Yom Kippur War had left a searing memory. It provided the impetus for devising an energy strategy that diversified sources. Hence, the European conflict with the United States as to what were appropriate instruments of influence to be deployed against the Soviet Union.

A similar situation may now be presenting itself. Although the Obama administration has not yet called for a boycott of Russian energy exports, it may look in that direction given the unlikelihood that other trade sanctions will dissuade Vladimir Putin from continuing to pursue as assertive policy in Ukraine. Just as the Cameron government in Britain shies away from financial sanctions due to the deleterious effect that they would have on the economy (and his political prospects in next year's elections), so too are all European leaders sensitive to the high price that their countries would pay were they to interfere with the mutually beneficial energy commerce they have with Russia.

There is no doubt that on some objective scale of measurement, Russia stands to suffer more economic loss from such a disruption than does Europe. However, economic sensitivity per se does not translate into commensurate vulnerability to the pressure exerted by economic sanctions. There are crucial intervening variables of a political nature. They concern the strength of governmental leadership, how responsive it is to public sentiment, the means at their disposition to contain or repress dissent, and their ability to arouse a nationalist response. Success in fostering the feeling that the motherland is being mistreated and disrespected by foreign powers can strengthen the collective resolve not to give in to economic sanctions whatever the price paid.

A New U.S. Strategy

The current structure of the international energy market is unfavorable to any Western policy that aims to a) reduce Europe's dependence on the energy imports from Russia, and b) thereby, to reduce Moscow's leverage while increasing that that of the United States and its allies. This circumstance has prompted Washington officials to draw up plans whereby the logic of the markets can be reversed. Their centerpiece is the expansion of natural gas production via fracking and other non-conventional methods, an emphasis on exports to Europe that would markedly reduce reliance on Russian sources, and the promotion of fracking in Ukraine and Poland.

This long-term plan acquired immediacy with the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine. Many in Washington were looking anxiously for methods to shift the balance of influence between Russia and the West. Freeing Europe from the energy leverage exercised by Moscow has struck many as an attractive possibility. A New York Times lead editorial opined that the Energy Department should "speed up its review of export applications, and Congress could help by easing restrictions on exports."

Others go further. "In WW II, we were the arsenal of democracy; I think we're going to be the arsenal of energy" so proclaims the former director of energy issues at the NSC, Robert McNally. Increased supplies from the United States are creating "a radically changed market" that will undercut Russia's influence, according to Carlos Pascal who heads the State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources (and former ambassador to Ukraine. The Bureau was set up in 2011 and with a staff of 85 is dedicated to exploiting the American energy boom to strengthen its geopolitical influence. Curbing Russia's own use of the energy instrument was the primary objective from the outset. Energy, in short, was one element in the United States' grand strategy of weakening Russia as a player on the international scene and curtailing its global influence. This has been the prevailing view ever since Vladimir Putin began to demonstrate his goal of reestablishing Russia as an autonomous power in world affairs.

Minimizing the United States' own dependence on oil from the Middle East has been the second foreign policy consideration.

The key to doing so is the building of export capacity - transporting Canadian oil via the proposed Keystone pipeline, extending natural gas pipelines, and constructing facilities on the Gulf Coast for Liquid Natural Gas (LNG). The national security factor has figured prominently in the Obama administration's deliberations about the cost/benefits of investing in these projects - along with environmental concerns, and the loss to American natural gas users of the present price advantage they derive from domestic production.*

The strategy has included an aggressive campaign to promote fracking in Western as well as Eastern Europe. That has meant lobbying governments, industry and public opinion. Tangible results have been modest to date. Fracking in Ukraine and Poland is in the cards but a number of Western European countries, e.g. Germany and France, have imposed outright prohibitions, while the British government's planned limited trial runs have met with fierce resistance. The hope in Washington is that the Ukraine crisis will spur actions in both the United States and in European capitals to develop production and international trade.

The effects of this on the immediate situation will be negligible. There is no spigot that can be turned on. It will be years before the United States will be technically able to export natural gas. By that time, the Ukraine's fate will be determined one way or another. Moreover, even over the long-term there are significant obstacles to a meaningful transformation of the European energy picture. First, the political opposition to fracking in Western Europe seems to be a fixed element not susceptible to change due to events in Ukraine. Second, leading governments there are reluctant to make the major capital investments in port and transport facilities that would be required to handle very large LNG imports from North America.

Third, the level of concern there about Russia using energy exports as a political tool against them is quite low. For their view of Putin's ambitions is guarded; they reject the notion favored in Washington that the West is facing a strategic challenge something like that of the Soviet Union in the old days. Their response to Hillary Clinton's alarmist cry that Putin was behaving like Hitler in the 1930s has been to view it derisively. Fourth, the Western Europeans' main interest in natural gas imports from the United States, such as it is, is commercial. They wish to avoid having their industries handicapped in competition with their American rivals by wide differentiations in cost of natural gas. At present, there is little evidence of their suffering much from that seeming disadvantage.

Conclusion

At the present, it is highly unlikely that the Western governments will seek to use energy commerce with Russia as an instrument of leverage with Russia. The cost-benefit calculations that lead to devalue that tactic conceivably could change were the crisis to deepen. A move by Russia into the mainly Russian speaking eastern part of Ukraine in an attempt to impose a permanent division of the country would raise the stakes immeasurably. This good reason, though, to downplay the possibility of that happening since the wider implications of such an escalation do not correspond to Russia's national interests. The downside of a calculated escalation heavily outweigh any benefits that the Kremlin may reasonably envisage.

The United States will be unable to export substantial quantities of natural gas until late in the decade. Its present capacity is only 5 bcm with another 20 bcm under construction. Expanding export terminals is a long and costly process. That is one reason why, as the International Energy Agency has explained "Gas remains stubbornly resistant to globalisation....downstream markets, industry and regulatory structure retain their region-specific natures." The report goes on to say: "In Europe, persistent macro-economic weakness, low carbon prices and non-market-based renewable policies squeeze gas between cheap coal and growing renewables." (IEA GAS Medium-Term Market Report 2013)

At the receiving end, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) import capacity additions have slowed to a crawl. "The outlook remains relatively bleak for the....LNG terminals currently at the planning stage." Moreover, LNG project costs have been steadily rising over the past few years and all are typically completed a year or more behind schedule.##3124|Empty##3125|The pilot of a Royal Malaysian Air Force search aircraft shows a map of the search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane over the Straits of Malacca on Thursday (AP photo).

KUALA LUMPUR - Planes sent to check the spot where Chinese satellite images showed possible debris from the missing Malaysian jetliner found nothing on Thursday, Malaysia's civil aviation chief said, deflating the latest lead in the six-day hunt.

''There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing,'' Azharuddin Abdul Rahman told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.

Vietnam also announced it had been unable to find any debris in the area where Chinese satellite images captured three floating objects which sparked hopes the missing plane had been located.

A Vietnamese plane sent on Thursday morning to search the area did not find anything, said Lai Xuan Thanh, head of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam.

Vietnam's Deputy Transport Minister Pham Quy Tieu told The Associated Press that the area had been "searched thoroughly'' by searchers from other countries over the past few days. Doan Huu Gia, chief of air search and rescue coordination centre, said Malaysian and Singaporean aircraft were scheduled to visit the area again Thursday.

Adding to the mystery, the Wall Street Journal reported that US investigators suspect the plane flew on for four hours once it lost contact with air traffic controllers, based on data from the plane's engines that is automatically downloaded and transmitted to the ground as part of routine maintenance programmes.

The report, based on two anonymous sources, raises questions as to why the Boeing 777-200 would have been flying without passive or active contact with the ground, and if anyone would have been in control during that time.

US counterterrorism officials were considering whether a pilot or someone else on board intentionally disabled the jetliner's transponders to avoid detection and divert it, the report said.

The hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been punctuated by false leads since it disappeared with 239 people aboard about an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday.

The plane was heading northeast over the Gulf of Thailand towards Vietnam when it vanished. The last message from the cockpit of the missing flight was routine: ''All right, good night,'' was the signoff transmitted to air traffic controllers.

Shortly after that it fell off commercial radar, but military authorities say it might have turned west and flown into the northern stretches of the Straits of Malacca, based on unconfirmed traces seen on its air defence radar.

Dozens of ships and aircraft from 12 nations have been searching the Gulf of Thailand and the strait, but no trace has been found. The search area has grown to 92,600 square kilometres, or about the size of Portugal.

If the Wall Street Journal report is confirmed, the search area will have to significantly expand.

The Chinese satellite imagery showing possible debris was not far from the last confirmed position of the plane, between Malaysia and Vietnam. The images and coordinates were posted on the website of China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence.

China's state Xinhua News Agency said the images taken around 11am (10am Thailand time) on Sunday appeared to show "three suspected floating objects'' of varying sizes in a 20-kilometre radius, the largest about 24-by-22 metres off the southern tip of Vietnam.

Li Jiaxiang, chief of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said later China had yet to confirm any link between the suspected floating objects and the plane.

Malaysian authorities have come under fire for their handling of the search amid sometimes confusing and conflicting statements, including the time of the plane's disappearance. Officials had also said that five passengers had checked into the flight but did not board the plane, and their luggage had been removed, but later they said this was not true.

Malaysia's air force chief said Wednesday that an unidentified object appears on military radar records about 320 kilometres northwest of Penang, Malaysia, and experts were analysing the data to determine whether the blip is the missing plane.

Authorities have not ruled out any possible cause for the flight's disappearance - including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage and terrorism - and are waiting to find any wreckage or debris to determine what went wrong.

Two US Federal Aviation Administration technical experts and a regional representative are in Kuala Lumpur as part of a US National Transportation Safety Board team supporting the investigation. Experts in air traffic control and radar are providing technical help, the board said.##3126|Empty##3127|Images released by China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense that it says are three large floating objects in an area where missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 vanished. Credit: AAP/SASTIND China has released several satellite images its officials say could be wreckage from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 with 239 people onboard.

If they are proved to be true it shows how remote sensing satellites can play an important role in locating the wreckage of a crashed plane. It can be done within a couple of hours after the accident if multiple high-resolution satellites are used.

About satellites

Remote sensing satellites can be broadly classified into two categories – optical and radar satellites.

Optical satellites can now deliver unclassified images at a resolution of half a metre while radar satellites can provide unclassified images at one metre resolution.

Metallic structures such as plane wreckage can produce strong return on radar images, making them easily visible. Satellite imaging radar can also "see" through any cloud and can take images day and night.

According to China's satellite images – taken over the suspected crash area a day after flight MH370 went missing on Saturday – the largest object shown is about 24m by 22m. This is clearly large enough to be imaged by both optical and radar satellites.

It should be noted from the images that the object is closely surrounded by cloud. Any potential wreckage would not be spotted by optical satellite if it were covered by cloud but it would still be visible on a radar image.

That's why it makes sense to use both optical and radar satellites in any search for the location of plane wreckage.

Satellite remote sensing has many advantages over conventional air and sea search using ships and aircraft.

The satellites orbit around Earth at a height between 200km to 900km and can cover a large area, typically 100km by 100km (100,000 square kilometres – about the size of Cuba) or even 500km by 500km (250,000 square kilometres – about the size of the UK), with a single image collected in only a few seconds.

It would take an aircraft between 1.5 and 34 hours to cover the same area. A ship will take much longer.

So it is much more cost effective to use remote sensing satellites to search over large areas.

Another advantage of satellites is that once in orbit the cameras and radar sensors on board are always on standby. They can be switched on immediately, as soon as the space agencies are informed of an accident, and be pointed straight at the area around the last known coordinates of the aircraft.

This also makes them much quicker to respond to incidents such as the air crash than the air and sea search vessels.

Another advantage is that satellites can take images globally without the issue around border protection so it is much easier to use them in international search.

Any limits?

Although the remote sensing satellites have the potential for global coverage some do have difficulty in imaging the two poles. That's because they use near-polar orbits and not all of them have side-looking capability – they mostly look only down.

If an aircraft goes missing in the mountains, there is also a good chance that any wreckage may be hidden under the forest canopy. Although long wavelength radars can penetrate tree canopy, they may still have difficulty in seeing through the dense tropical forest.

In contrast, the open sea is a more favourable environment for searching a missing aircraft with satellite remote sensing, because the main features in a satellite image will be just sea water and the plane wreckage – there is less chance of confusing any wreckage with any other targets, such as trucks, trains or farm houses, as in the case of a plane crash on land.

Satellites in other disasters

Since 2008 the Geodesy and Earth Observing Systems group (GEOS), at the UNSW School of Civil & Environmental Engineering has responded, in near real-time, to a range of natural disasters using both optical and radar satellite remote sensing.

These events include major earthquakes in China and New Zealand, bushfire in Victoria and floods in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

The team has repeatedly demonstrated that intelligence such as ground deformation, fire and flood extent can be extracted and delivered to relevant authorities within two hours of satellite image capture.

Investors remained cautious on Monday, as Russia began to amass troops in Crimea ahead of the region’s “election” on March 16. China helped contribute to the gloom, as Saturday’s report that Chinese exports sank in February stoked anxiety about the state of the global economy, sending stocks moderately lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) lost 34 points to finish Monday’s trading session at 16,418 for a 0.21 percent decline. The S&P 500 (SPY) dipped 0.05 percent to 1,877.

The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) advanced 0.08 percent to finish at 3,706. The Russell 2000 (IWM) declined 0.23 percent to 1,200.

On London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange, May futures for Brent crude oil declined $1.11 (1.02 percent) to $107.35/bbl. (BNO).

April gold futures declined $1.60 (0.12 percent) to $1,339.80 per ounce (GLD).

The transportation sector got stuck in traffic during Monday’s trading session, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average declined 0.16 percent to 7,580 (IYT).

In Japan, disappointing economic data upstaged the exchange rate for the yen as the dominant factor in stock market activity on Monday. The nation’s GDP expansion during the fourth quarter of 2013 fell short of expectations, reaching only 0.70 percent. The result indicated a retreat from the preliminary estimate of 1.0 percent growth and it fell short of economists’ expectations for 0.90 percent expansion.

Japan’s Ministry of Finance had more bad news on Monday. The nation’s current account deficit expanded to the equivalent of over $15 billion – its highest level in almost 30 years. Meanwhile, the exchange rate for the yen remained relatively unchanged, trading at 103.05 per dollar during the last ten minutes of Monday’s trading session in Tokyo (FXY). The Nikkei 225 Stock Average sank 1.01 percent to 15,120 (EWJ).

In China, Saturday’s release of the nation’s trade balance report brought bad news. The nation’s exports decreased by 18.1 percent on a year-over-year basis in February, resulting in a trade deficit. The awful report is expected to put pressure on the People’s Bank of China to weaken the yuan. The report re-ignited concerns about the state of the global economy, sending the spot price of copper 1.62 percent lower (after a 4.27 percent nosedive on Friday) to $3.03 per pound.

The Shanghai Composite Index sank 2.86 percent to 1,999 (FXI). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.75 percent to 22,264 (EWH).

The bad news from China caused mining companies to drag the major European stock indices lower. Ongoing tension over Russia’s plans for Crimea kept European investors in a risk-averse mood. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Monday’s session with a 0.08 percent dip to 3,092.79 – remaining just a whisker above its 50-day moving average of 3,092.38. Its Relative Strength Index is 48.12 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,827 on Monday, despite taking a 0.05 percent dip to 1,877. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) declined from 66.40 to 65.92. The MACD and the signal line are both climbing above the zero line, suggesting that the S&P could resume its advance during the immediate future.

On Monday, four sectors advanced and five sectors declined. The industrial sector took the hardest hit, falling 0.43 percent.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY): -0.27%

Technology: (XLK): -0.16%

Industrials (XLI): -0.43%

Materials: (XLB): -0.08%

Energy (XLE): +0.16%

Financials: (XLF): +0.04%

Utilities (XLU): -0.25%

Health Care: (XLV): +0.42%

Consumer Staples (XLP): +0.09%

Bottom line: Russia’s Crimean adventure combined with disappointing export data from China to send stocks moderately lower on Monday.

(Memphis) It's part of the latest push by the Obama Administration to get people to sign up for insurance.

Well known celebrities such as NBA legends Alonzo Mourning and Magic Johnson are appearing in ads to get people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, but are large numbers of Memphians enrolling?

The Church Health Center in Memphis provides affordable healthcare for the low-wage working, uninsured. Marvin Stockwell is communications director.

"The majority of our patients in Memphis won't receive a subsidy through the Affordable Care Act because Tennessee did not, at least so far, didn't expand its Medicaid plan," Stockwell said.

But according to a Bankrate.com report 41 percent of uninsured Americans plan to remain uninsured.

"Frankly, I think that's when we'll see more acceptance is when people begin hearing their friends have had a good experience. Why are people electing to stay uninsured? It has a lot to do with the affordability issue," Stockwell said.

The Bankrate.com report says more than 40 percent say health insurance is still too expensive and they'd rather pay a fine and many are still unaware of healthcare subsidies.

Christ Community Health Services also provides health care for Memphians and Shelby Countians who are uninsured.

Amanda Chandler is director of population health at Christ Community, "We've seen an increase since October since the opening of the Marketplace."

She says despite the media push, it's unfortunate many still have misconceptions about the Affordable Care Act.

"I'm not sure why everyone would not be signing up for insurance. I think a lot of is just education that need to continue surround healthcare.gov," Chandler said.

Christ Community will offer a healthcare enrollment event March 25 at Greater Community Temple Church on Winchester from 11 a.m to 6 p.m.##3132|Empty##3133|It’s here at long, long last! The wedding of the century. Forget those royals, forget that person on TV with a skating rink on her finger: After months of sparring, Men’s Wearhouse is buying Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion. Let’s hope the new couple doesn’t get into another fight over who will provide the tuxedos.

Both companies have played the suitor in the months-long, often kind of nasty battle to buy each other out, but it appears Men’s Wearhouse has emerged the victor. The two rivals announced today that Men’s Wearhouse is forking over about $65 per share to buy Jos. A. Bank, to create a company with expected annual sales of $3.5 billion, reports the Los Angeles Times.

The new couple will be proud parents to 1,700 stores in the U.S. and 23,000 employees once all is said and done, but the two chains will still operate as separate brands.

“We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Jos. A. Bank, which we believe will deliver substantial benefits to our respective shareholders, employees and customers,” said Doug Ewert, Men’s Wearhouse chief executive. “Together, Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth.”

And Jos. A. Bank won’t be bringing any other companies along, as the company agreed to drop its plans to buy Eddie Bauer as part of the buyout deal.

The two should become one in the next few months if federal officials approve the acquisition.

Men’s Wearhouse to buy Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion after long battle [The Los Angeles Times]##3134|DENVER (AP) — In the world’s first accounting of a recreational pot industry, Colorado officials say the state has made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, the first month of sales.

The tax total reported Monday by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

The state legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January.

Washington state sales begin in the coming months.

The taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. The first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though not all were open in January.##3135|Bloomberg Bill Ackman

There’s more than one way to go after Herbalife /quotes/zigman/361145/delayed /quotes/nls/hlf HLF .

The New York Times has an extensive report about how, after staking $1 billion on the collapse of the nutritional supplement company, Bill Ackman’s activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management has been aggressively lobbying to bring the company down.

An investigation by the Times found Ackman’s team has helped organize protests and letter-writing campaigns across the U.S. to pressure state and federal regulators to investigate Herbalife. Ackman retained the Dewey Square Group, a Washington-based firm that specializes in “grass-roots advocacy,” to influence officials by recruiting surrogates to speak out against Herbalife in emails, letters, tweets or rallies, the Times said.

The report says Ackman’s team has paid civil-rights organizations at least $130,000 to collect names of people who claim they were victimized by Herbalife. Ackman has argued that he is trying to protect Hispanics, who he says are most frequently recruited by Herbalife as distributors – only to find out that there is little money to be made from selling the supplements.

Herbalife has mobilized its own lobbyists to defend itself. Last month, the Times says, the company held a private briefing for more than 30 Capitol Hill aides to argue against Ackman’s charges.

The Times points out Ackman so far has little to show for his efforts. Herbalife’s stock has risen, in part because billionaire investor Carl Icahn decided to buy a large stake in the company, and regulators lobbied by Ackman haven’t take any formal action against Herbalife.

DENVER, March 10 (Reuters) - Sales of recreational marijuana products in Colorado added more than $2.1 million to state coffers in tax receipts and other fees in the first month retail sales of the drug were allowed, state figures showed on Monday.

The figures, which the Colorado Department of Revenue said were in line with expectations, add to just over $1.4 million collected in taxes and fees on medical marijuana in the state in the same month.

The figures for recreational marijuana include revenues from a 2.9 percent sales tax, a special 10 percent tax on retail pot sales and a 15 percent excise tax imposed on growers, as well as licensing fees, the department said in a statement.

The numbers indicate the state’s recreational pot stores did about $14 million in gross sales for the month.

“We expect clear patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts,” said Barbara Pohl, executive director of the department.

Voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized the possession and use of small amounts recreational marijuana by adults age 21 or older in 2012, even as marijuana remains an illegal narcotic under federal law.

Colorado opened its retail pot shops in January, and Washington is slated to follow suit later this year.

Under the Colorado legalization law, the first $40 million collected annually from the excise tax is earmarked for school construction and repairs.

The state legislature will decide how to spend any leftover money from marijuana taxes and fees.

Governor John Hickenlooper, who opposed the legalization of recreational cannabis, has told lawmakers he would like to see the bulk of state revenue derived from both recreational and medical pot sales to go toward addiction treatment and programs to prevent youths from using the drug.##3140|Source: http://www.guidetobelize.info/de/reisen/belize-zug-eisenbahn-guide.shtml

Chiquita Brands International of the US and Fyffes of Ireland said today they have agreed to combine in an all-stock transaction valued at about $1.07bn, that will be the world’s largest banana company.

Chiquita shareholders would own 50.7% of the new company, ChiquitaFyffes, which would have $4.6bn in annual revenue and 32,000 employees globally, Fyffes said.

Wikipedia says Chiquita is the final name in a long list of companies whose ultimate origin was the United Fruit Company, formed in 1899 by the merging of the Boston Fruit Company and various fruit exporting concerns controlled by Minor C. Keith. In 1970 it became the United Brands Company when it was purchased by Eli Black. He outbid two other conglomerates, Zapata Corporation and Textron, for a controlling interest in the company. In fact, that is a condensed version of what has actually happened to United Fruit Co., famed in the U.S. for Chiquita bananas, but known to generations of Latin Americans as "el Pulpo" (the Octopus). In 1990 the company became Chiquita Brands International.

The original “Banana Republic” was Honduras: United Fruit Company had many banana plantations, practically controlled the country economically and got involved in politics as well. Since the term was coined, the word has grown to be applied to any country with unstable, non-democratic governments, and abundant foreign influence, especially in economics. The many countries in Latin America that were dominated by United Fruit Company (UFCo) in the first half of the 20th century certainly fit that definition.

The New York Times wrote in 2008: [Today, “the banana is the world’s fourth major food, after rice, wheat and milk.” But when a Brooklyn-born twentysomething named Minor Keith planted a few banana cuttings next to a railroad track in Costa Rica in the early 1870s, it was virtually unknown outside its native environs. Keith and his partners soon realized how great the potential profits were — especially if, along with growing bananas, they could control railroads, shipping and Central American governments (to that end, Keith married the beautiful daughter of a Costa Rican president). Only then did they set out to turn the banana into a product for the masses. Until its demise a hundred years later, United Fruit controlled as much as 90% of the market.]

Fyffes Announces merger with Chiquita, FY13 numbers in-line: Patrick Higgins of Goodbody comments - - "Fyffes announced this morning that it will combine with Chiquita in a stock for stock transaction. This will result in Fyffes shareholders holding 49.3% of the new entity, ChiquitaFyffes plc. The group will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and domiciled in Ireland. The merger will create the largest player globally, with c.14% market share. The transaction values Fyffes at €1.22, a 38% premium to current levels.

The new company will have an equity value of c. $1.1bn and net debt of $576m. Combined EBITDA is $174m, with an additional $40m expected in synergies. Another synergy benefit from the transaction is on the balance sheet. Chiquita was highly leveraged at 4.7x EBITDA, the new entity will have a more manageable net debt / EBITDA of 2.7x. Fyffes management will have governance of the new entity also, with David McCann to be appointed the new CEO, Tom Murphy the new CFO and Coen Boss the new COO.

Fyffes reported FY13 results this morning with EPS in-line with our forecasts at 8.8c, +3.1% yoy. Sales came in at €839m, +7% , while adjusted EBITA was €32.7m (vs Goodbody €31.9m), at the top end of the guidance range of €29-€34m. Banana sales were up in the year as the group continued to grow volumes; however profits were down slightly due primarily to higher fruit costs. Pricing was weak in H1 although a significant pick up occurred during the summer months due a tightening of supply. Overall pricing increased but insufficiently to offset the continuing rise in fruit costs.

Melons, which is predominantly H1 weighted, performed strongly as the group continues to grow its market share in the key import season in the US. Profits in Fyffes pineapple business rose strongly benefitting from an improvement in market conditions and stability in supply volumes, particularly in H1.

Current trading has been satisfactory in the year to date, although pricing is behind year on year. As a result and given the potential for volatility in the core banana business over the course of the year, management has set a wide initial guidance range for adjusted EBITA of €30-35m (vs. Goodbody forecasts for €33.7m). At first glance, we are unlikely to change our forecasts."

The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) announced that it will hold a bond auction on Thursday, 13 March, the first such auction since 21 September 2010.



Speaking today, John Corrigan, NTMA chief executive said: “The resumption of scheduled bond auctions builds on the phased re-entry to the capital markets achieved by the NTMA over the past two years and marks the full normalisation of Ireland’s presence in the markets.”



The details of the bond auction on 13 March are as follows:



Bond to be auctioned: 3.40% Treasury Bond 2024



Auction size: €1bn



The auction will be conducted on the Bloomberg Auction System and will be confined to recognised primary dealers.

Escher Group FY13 results statement highlights positive pipeline: Rachael of Goodbody comments - - "Escher Group has announced FY13 results this morning. Revenue of $24.7m had already been reported in the group’s trading statement in January while adjusted EBITDA came in at $4.2m (company definition), 5% ahead of the $4m guidance given in January. Adj. EPS came in at 4.8c versus our 5.6c forecast with a higher interest and tax charges the key differences.

License revenue was $5.1m, -19% yoy, and -5% versus our forecast. The statement notes that the yoy performance was impacted by the fact that the group received licence revenue from Malaysia in the prior year but this was somewhat offset by the extension of the number of licences in the Saudi Post contract and ongoing payments received from USPS. In addition, this revenue was held back by the delay of the USPS licence fee in 2013. The group remains confident of recognising this revenue in H114 (c. $6m). Maintenance revenue was $5.4m, +6% yoy, driven by the full year impact of customers signed in 2012. Support revenue was -11% yoy to $2.5m, which reflected a contract renewal done during the year. In terms of services revenue, it was +35% yoy to $11.6m, versus our $10.3m forecast, driven by the group's work with the USPS and the Malaysian post office. Gross profit margin (61% v 66% in 2012) was impacted by the revenue mix which was more weighted towards the lower margin services revenue during the year.

On current trading and outlook, for the Riposte division (postal software) the statement notes that the group has been in contact with several postal organisations and is confident of signing new customers in 2014. Within Escher Interactive Services (digital mail and mobile wallet solutions), it notes that the pipeline of opportunities has expanded significantly over the last 12 months and Escher remains confident about the prospects for 2014.

Overall, we are unlikely to make any significant changes to FY14 forecasts following this morning’s announcement. It is encouraging to see the group note the pipeline of potential deals for both of its divisions. While we have c.3 wins in our forecasts per annum for its postal software division already, further traction in its interactive services division could see upside to group forecasts and our price target.

Banks: SME survey indicates uptick in loan refusal rate; Eamonn Hughes and Colm Foley comment - - "The latest Quarterly Bank Watch Survey at the end of February by ISME, the small and medium sized enterprises association, has shown that refusal rates by banks to lend to small businesses rose by 4 points to 54%. The survey of 924 owner-managers of SMEs also found that 60% of respondents had increased of bank charges imposed on them whilst 18% had incurred increased interest rates.

The uptick in refusals comes against the background of the improving economy and the previous quarterly survey which reported an improving refusal rate from 58% to 50%. Indeed, credit standards in the most recent Central Bank input to the EU Bank Lending Survey highlighted unchanged credit standards for the SME sector in Q413 whilst there was an expectation that standards in Q114 would also be unchanged.

The quick reversal in the refusal rate is surprising and something we’ll need to monitor, but ongoing evidence of an improving economy highlights that, on balance, conditions for the SME sector should be showing some signs of improvement. Evidence of higher charges is also likely to flow through to better income for the banks in due course.

Economic View: GDP data likely to confirm investment-led recovery; Dermot O'Leary of Goodbody comments - - "Positive momentum in the Irish economy is expected to be confirmed by this week’s Q4 2013 GDP data. A key feature of recent quarters, and indeed of our forecasts for the coming years, is that a rebound in investment is leading recovery in domestic demand. This should be a feature of the Q4 2013 data.

For 2013 as a whole, we are forecasting that GDP grew by 0.4%, following a 0.2% expansion in 2012. On first glance, therefore, describing Ireland as a “growth beacon” would be very much an exaggeration. However, the “patent cliff” in the pharmaceutical sector has played a significant role in depressing GDP growth over that period; we estimate 1.0% to 1.5%. More encouraging is the trend in domestic demand. In Q3 2013, domestic demand, excluding the volatile aircraft component, grew by 1.6%, its fastest rate of growth since 2007. Within this, investment grew by 8% yoy, with contributions from both business machinery and equipment and construction. Surveys over recent months suggest that trends in the former continued, while momentum in the construction sector has also been maintained (confirmed by this morning’s PMI). After falling for the first three quarters of the year, we expect consumer spending to make a small contribution to growth in Q4.

Another key aspect of the GDP data that we will be watching closely is the nominal data, as they will act as an input into the deficit and debt to GDP calculations. News on this front has been slightly disappointing of late, owing to very low inflationary pressures. The key theme of the data though should be one of an improving, and indeed better quality, economic recovery.

Irish and European industry continues to recover in 2014: Conall Mac Coille of Davy comments - - "European stock indices fell on Friday: the Euro Stoxx 50 fell 1.6% and the S&P500 rose 0.1%. On-going tensions over Crimea held back risk appetite despite better-than- expected US non-farm payrolls at 175,000. US Treasury yields jumped on the news to above 2.8% from 2.72%. The euro rose to a fresh high against the dollar, breaking through $1.39 in early trade, as investors weighed the ECB’s decision to keep rates on hold.

German industrial production grew by 5.0% in the year to January 2014, well above expectations. French data released this morning show manufacturing up 1.4% on the year. Italian figures will be released at 09.00 this morning. Given the strength of euro area manufacturing PMI surveys (53.2 in February) and the hard data on output, the consensus forecast for just 1.9% euro area industrial production growth in 2014 looks overly pessimistic.

In this context, Friday’s industrial production data for Ireland provided further evidence that the sector is benefitting from the improving cycle in Europe. Irish industrial production fell by 1.1% in the year to January but was split between a 5.3% fall in the modern sector and a 7.8% rise in traditional manufacturing.

Output in the labour-intensive traditional sector (accounting for two-thirds, or 137,100, of total industrial sector employment of 200,000), is gradually recovering, broadly in tandem with the broader European sector. In contrast, the pharmaceutical sector has been hurt by the patent cliff. However, pharmaceutical companies employ just 40,000 and have responded to the patent cliff by increasing investment in plant and R&D to bring the next generation of drugs to market. So, even within the pharmaceutical sector, there has been no evidence of aggregate job cuts.

Separately, new cars licensed in February were up 23% on 2013 levels and new goods vehicles licensed were up by 45%. This provides further evidence that the rebound in Irish consumer and business confidence has led households and companies to increase their spending. Indeed, the surge in Irish consumer confidence through H2 2013 was accompanied by a pick-up in surveys on households’ intentions to spend on big ticket items such as cars."##3141|Oil tanker now in international waters, says GNC member

A man is thrilled after hanging a flat-screen television on his living room wall, waltzing over to the kitchen to grab snacks.

And then, like the tortilla chip in his mouth, the TV shatters into pieces, after falling to the floor.





"Installing your TV while high is now legal," says the ad, but, "driving to get a new one isn't."





According to USA Today , it is one of three advertisements in a "Drive High, Get a DUI" campaign by Colorado to combat stoned driving, since the state started selling recreational marijuana on Jan. 1.













Washington is the only other state where recreational pot is legalized, and it plans to begin selling it this year, USA Today reported.





"As Coloradans now have more access to marijuana, we want them to be aware that law enforcement is trained to identify impairment by all categories of drugs and alcohol," Col. Scott Hernandez, chief of the Colorado State Patrol, said in a statement





In another advertisement , a man continues to dribble a basketball on the court as other players look on impatiently. A third ad features a man trying to turn on the grill, not realizing the propane tank is missing.





The ads use humour to remind drivers not to use marijuana and get behind the wheel.





The approach is receiving kudos online, but not everyone is impressed, some saying the ads exaggerate behaviour and ridicule pot smokers.





"Hey CDOT, if you want marijuana consumers to listen to you, I'd suggest talking to them like the rational, normal adults they are instead of insulting them," wrote one YouTube user.





"I understand that in order to make a point you're going to want to exaggerate things a bit but isn't this clearly going too far," another commenter wrote on YouTube.





"Any logical, reasonable person should be able to see how this is a fraudulent, misleading, and flat-out insulting representation of pot smokers, right?"





According to the Colorado Department of Transportation , it is illegal to drive with five nanograms of active THC per millilitre of blood. Those who do can be prosecuted for driving under the influence.





But as USA Today reported, it is difficult to discern how much marijuana that is.

The nutrition and supplement company’s shares plunged more than 12 percent following a brief halt in trading pending the announcement.

Herbalife said that it received the civil investigative demand from the FTC on Wednesday. A representative from the FTC was not immediately available to elaborate. The FTC’s website says that these are used to investigate possible “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”

The company, which has faced accusations of operating a pyramid scheme, said that it welcomes the inquiry given “tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace” about its business.

Herbalife says it believes it is in compliance with all laws and regulations and plans to cooperate fully. The company, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and based in Los Angeles, uses a network of distributors to sell its nutritional supplements and weight-loss products globally.

The FTC inquiry comes just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company.

Ackman has bet against the company and said repeatedly that he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme, which is when a company makes most of its money by recruiting new salespeople rather than on the products that they sell.

On Tuesday, the head of Pershing Square Capital Management resumed this effort Tuesday, holding a public event to detail his firm’s claims of how its Herbalife is operating as a pyramid scheme in China, violating laws there.

Herbalife has repeatedly denied the claims and rival investor Carl Icahn has disagreed as well, taking his fight against Ackman public and increasing his stake in the company.

Its shares fell $5.57, or 8.5 percent, to $59.92 in mid-afternoon, but fell as low as $54.59 earlier. Its shares had fallen almost 17 percent so far this year through Tuesday’s close.##3145|Empty##3146|The Incidental Economist found back in 2009 that high-risk pools, which were active in 35 states, only accommodated up to 54 percent of possible individuals within a state, and sometimes only one percent.

"Many health care analysts fear that widespread acceptance of HSAs will separate the wealthy and healthy from the sick in insurance pools," they wrote, "and drive up premiums and out-of-pocket health costs for the latter." It's not clear whether that happened, but HSAs grew in popularity between 2007 and 2013 (from five percent to 20 percent of workers) as employers tried to cut down on healthcare costs. The plans definitely benefit wealthy individuals over low income individuals, who can't use the tax benefits or afford high deductibles as easily.

Inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together: The Small Business Health Options Plan — the SHOP exchange — already allows business owners to sign up and select plans for employees to choose from. Enrollment has been slow, but unlike the individual market, the SHOP exchange is open year round. The GOP likely wouldn't offer an exchange, but just encourage businesses to buy insurance together with tax breaks.

Maybe Included

Buying insurance across state lines: As Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic explains, in the past insurance was more expensive in some states because of regulations that required insurers to sell plans regardless of pre-existing conditions. If insurers could sell across state lines, insurers would relocate to states with lower regulation, where they would be allowed to identify customers more freely.

Guaranteed renewability of policies: What's important here is that Republicans are only considering including guaranteed renewability in their plan. The GOP plan might reverse that provision in Obamacare, but it's unlikely.

Changes to medical-malpractice regulations: This is something both Democrats and Republicans support, depending on what the reforms are. "There are versions that simply shield physicians from lawsuits or limit their liability, rather than improving the system so that truly bad providers receive punishment and quality of care improves," writes Cohn. In the past the GOP has supported bills to cap pain and suffering payments at $250,000, but states' rights activists within the party derailed efforts for federal regulation.

This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.##3147|The administration is claiming a limited victory by saying the number of those enrolled in ObamaCare has now hit 5 million with two weeks to go until the March 31 deadline. If accurate, the number does represent a steep increase over the 4.2 million that were said to have signed up at the beginning of the month. At this rate, administration cheerleaders reason, the goal of 7 million enrolled in the Affordable Care Act may yet be reached at some point in the near future, if not quite on time. This burst of enrollments is seen as a vindication of President Obama’s all-out push to promote the law including such questionable activities as appearing on the “Between Two Ferns” web show where he traded barbs with comedian Zach Galifianakis.

But before the president and his team start popping the champagne corks to celebrate their achievement and their faux hipness, it’s time once again to point out that the administration’s Potemkin enrollment figures should be read with a truckload of salt. As the New York Times reported last month, as much as 20 percent of all those enrolled had not actually paid their premiums, meaning they were not covered by the program. While Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told Congress she had no idea what the numbers of unpaid enrollees were, more states are reporting these figures and, as CNBC reported last week, the results are literally all over the map. While some states report high pay rates, others like Maryland say only 54 percent have paid.

All this calls in to question not only the effectiveness of the sales job done by the president and celebrity supporters such as Lebron James. It also means that the odds that this system can sustain itself without mandating vast increases in rates for those who do pay are getting slimmer every day.

For months we’ve been told by the administration that the only problem with ObamaCare was a “glitchy” website that had since been fixed. But what has since become clear is that the effort to convince young and healthy Americans to sign up for insurance that is both expensive and not something they may need is a failure. Though many of those who clearly benefit from the new health law, such as the poor and those with pre-existing conditions, have signed up, the scheme requires large numbers of those who won’t need the coverage as often in order to be economically viable. That problem will be exacerbated by the failure of much larger percentages of customers to pay for their insurance.

As we’ve noted previously, the non-payment of the premium is not a technicality. Many of those purchasing the insurance may be first-time buyers and not understand that they must pay their bill before coverage starts rather than long after the fact, as they can with a credit card transaction. Or it may be that some enrolled with no intention of paying or thinking that the hype about the glories of ObamaCare they’ve heard in the mainstream media and from the president absolved them of the obligation to pay for it. But either way, the large number of non-payments renders the enrollment figures meaningless and ensures that the rates for those who do pay are going up next year by percentages that will shock them.

The president claimed that the number of enrollees has already reached the point where the law will work rather than collapse from lack of participation. But even if we accept his premise that falling millions of customers short of the announced goal of seven million is no big deal, the fact that hundreds of thousands of those being counted in the pool of those he’s counting are not covered because of non-payment of premiums makes his assertion a colossal fraud.

The president may think that a March madness ad blitz during the NCAA basketball tournament may save ObamaCare. But if the past pattern holds, any further surge in enrollment will provide the scheme with a false sense of security. Until we get a full accounting not only of those who signed up on a website but completed the process by paying for the plan they chose, we’ll have no idea how many people truly are enrolled. Seen in that light, the president’s enrollment promises may well turn out to be no different from other pledges he has made about the ACA in the last few years: completely untrue.##3148|King, the company behind the wildly popular Candy Crush Saga and other popular social games, has provided a look into exactly how much it thinks it can raise in its impending IPO.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday released an amended filing from King showing that the games maker plans to offer 22.2 million shares at its IPO and price them between $21 and $24. Another 3.3 million shares will be offered for over-allotments, should demand for the company's stock surge.

If King can offer all 25.5 million shares at a maximum offering price of $24, the company expects to raise $613 million. Based on all those figures, King is valued at $7.6 billion.

King, which plans to offer its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "KING," announced plans to file an IPO last month. The company did not, however, provide any details at that time on how many shares it would offer and at what price.

The figures from King shared Wednesday are not set in stone. Depending on the response to its shares, King could change its IPO price at the last minute or could decide to stick within its range. The information that the SEC released today is essentially an outline that's subject to change.

King did not say when it plans to file its IPO, but now that it's sharing figures, it appears to be marching toward that point quite swiftly.##3149|The March 31 deadline to sign up for a healthcare plan will be here soon.##3150|All ArticlesMORE BY THIS AUTHOR

##3151|- Sbarro said Monday that it is filing for bankruptcy reorganization, the struggling pizza chain's second trip through bankruptcy court in less than three years.

The filing comes after the company last month announced it would be close 155 of its 400 North American stores, most of which are located in malls and airports.

The company did not immediately provide details on whether any marketing or in-store changes were planned to help update its image and boost sales. It says it still has more than 800 locations worldwide.

Sbarro also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain's image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn't take hold.

Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., says its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent. It said its filing is designed to "allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy" as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.

Sbarro, sagging under $140 million in debt, had cited declining traffic in the mall food courts where it does much of its business for the closures.

Other restaurant chains have been hurt by declining mall traffic in recent recent years. Hot Dog on a Stick, an employee-owned chain with locations mostly in the West and Midwest, cited expensive mall leases in declaring bankruptcy last month.##3152|Investing.com -

Investing.com - China widened the range in which the yuan can fluctuate against the U.S. dollar at the weekend, signalling it could accept more volatility for the exchange rate and challenge the perception that the currency is a one-way bet.



The People's Bank of China said Saturday the yuan will be allowed to move 2% either side of the central parity against the dollar starting from Monday, doubling the previous 1% range.



China has pledged to make the yuan more flexible since 2005 when the currency was originally unshackled from its dollar peg and the country has a longer-term aim for a fully convertible yuan that was enshrined by the Communist Party at a meeting last November.



The government is committed to gradually dismantling China's capital account regime, but foreign exchange reserves are expected to rise sharply again this year, from $3.8 trillion to well over $4 trillion.



The weekend move was the third since July 2005 and follows a widening from 0.5% in April 2012.

Application may not work as expected.##3154|An investigation into the pilots of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 intensified Monday as officials confirmed that the last words spoken from the cockpit came after a key signalling system was manually disabled.

US intelligence efforts also were focusing on Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, according to a senior US lawmaker.

SPONSORED

“I think from all the information I’ve been briefed on from, you know, high levels within homeland security, national counterterrorism centre, intelligence community, that something was going on with the pilot,” said Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.

“I think this all leads towards the cockpit, with the pilot himself, and co-pilot,” McCaul said on Fox News Sunday.

Malaysia’s Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein confirmed that an apparently relaxed final voice communication from the cockpit — “All right, good night” — came after the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) had been deliberately shut down.

ACARS transmits to the ground key information on a plane’s condition.

It has not been confirmed who gave that final voice message. But the assumption is the person would have known the ACARS system had been disabled.

The plane’s transponder — which relays radar information on the plane’s location — was switched off 14 minutes after ACARS went down.

Shortly afterwards the plane disappeared from civilian radar. It continued to show up as a blip on military radar, but was not immediately identified as the same flight.

The plane went missing early in the morning of March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard, spawning a massive international search across Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean that has turned up no trace of wreckage.

– ‘Contradictory information’ –

Two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight were Chinese, and state media in China attacked Malaysia anew on Monday for its handling of the crisis.

“The contradictory and piecemeal information Malaysia Airlines and its government have provided has made search efforts difficult and the entire incident even more mysterious,” the state-controlled China Daily newspaper wrote in an editorial.

For relatives of those on board, a hijacking scenario provides a slim hope that the plane might have landed undetected somewhere.

“If they found the wreckage of the plane then that would be finalised because there’s no hope,” said Australian David Lawton, whose brother was on the plane.

“But while you’ve got hope, you’ve got worries too. Because if they’re alive, are they being treated well, or what’s happening?” he told Fairfax media.

The number of countries involved in the physical search for the jet has nearly doubled over the past two days to 26, after satellite and military radar data projected two dauntingly large corridors the plane might have flown through.

The northern corridor stretches in an arc over south and central Asia, while the other swoops deep into the southern Indian Ocean towards Australia.

Malaysia announced that it was deploying its naval and air force assets to the southern corridor, with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott vowing substantial assistance.

Three officials from France’s civil aviation accident investigation agency arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to share their experiences of the search for Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.

The “black boxes” from that crash were eventually recovered nearly two years later from a depth of more than 3,800 meters (12,500 feet).

– Political dimension? –

The Malaysian authorities have stressed that the backgrounds of all the passengers and crew are being checked — as well as engineers who may have worked on the plane before take-off.

Senior US intelligence officials cited by the New York Times said they had run the names of everyone on board through their data banks without any tangible result.

That included a check on a passenger identified as an artist belonging to China’s Muslim Uighur minority. Uighur separatists have become increasingly militant in their fight against Chinese rule.

Malaysian police have searched both pilots’ residences and are examining a flight simulator that Captain Zaharie, 53, had installed at his home.

Associates say Zaharie was an active supporter of Malaysia’s political opposition headed by veteran politician Anwar Ibrahim.

In a highly controversial case, Anwar was convicted of sodomy — illegal in Muslim Malaysia — just hours before MH370 took off.

But friends say Zaharie exhibited no extreme views.

Fariq, meanwhile, was accused in an Australian television report of allowing two young South African women into the cockpit of a plane he piloted in 2011, breaching security rules imposed after the 9/11 attacks in the United States.

But acquaintances have attested to his good character, and reports said he planned to wed his flight-school sweetheart.

Hishammuddin noted that the two pilots “did not ask to fly together” on flight 370.##3155|Energy Secretary Ed Davey has ruled out energy companies hiking their prices due to the conflict in Ukraine as gas is typically bought 18 months in advance, and they should therefore be protected from short-term price fluctuations.

As it stands roughly 30% of gas in Europe is supplied by Russia and analysts have warned that prices may increase dramatically if sanctions are imposed on Russia.

Experts have, however, added that moderate winter temperatures mean many of Europe’s energy companies are in possession of larger than usual gas reserves.

Escalating conflict could lead to higher prices

Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Davey said: “The companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance. So they shouldn’t be using it as an excuse to put up people’s prices.

“But we have seen when this crisis broke there was a spike in oil and gas prices. They’ve now come down, but if there was an escalation, if there was a military conflict that went on for months and months, there could be an impact on prices.”

Britain should seek to be less dependent on energy exports

The energy secretary added that the Ukrainian crisis illustrated the need for Britain to develop its own sources of energy.

In this context, he commented on the need for additional energy to be produced via wind and nuclear power stations, as well as shale gas extraction.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Hertz (HTZ) said Tuesday it will spin off its equipment rental business, Hertz Equipment Rental, in an effort to refocus on the company's car rental business. The spinoff of Hertz' equipment rental business is expected to generate $2.5 billion in cash that will be used to pay down the company's debt and support a newly approved $1 billion share repurchase.

Overall, the spinoff may dramatically alter Hertz' capital structure, putting its leverage in line with competitors, while providing Wall Street with a far more straightforward car rental business. The move also comes as Hertz provided investors with a weaker-than-expected outlook for 2014.

Tuesday's decision to spin the equipment rental business may help Hertz weather a rough patch in the car rental market, while also insulating the company and its management from activist investors.

Hertz's newly announced share repurchase could allow the car rental chain to buy back 20% of its outstanding shares, the company said in a Tuesday statement. Hertz also raised the prospect of additional returns of capital to shareholders as a result of the company's targeted net debt ratio of 2.5-to-3.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

Those targets indicate Hertz could see its leverage rise from year-end net-debt of 2.9 times EBITDA, putting the company closer in line with Avis Budget (CAR). Analysts had forecast Hertz net debt-to-EBITDA could fall in the coming year without a change to its capital planning.

"The actions announced today will create separate companies which we expect to benefit from improved financial profiles that include increased earnings stability and higher returns on capital," Mark P. Frissora, CEO of Hertz said in a statement.

Equipment Rental

Hertz Equipment Rental may be renamed and will have its own management team after the spinoff. The business generated annual revenues of over $1.5 billion in 2013, with 38% of those sales from construction market, 26% from industrial users, and a further 36% from other markets including niche markets like the energy sector.

At separation, the business is expected to have net debt of 3.5 times-to-4.0 times 2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

Hertz will retain its Donlen fleet leasing business.

Hertz and Dollar Thrifty

For Hertz's more well-known car rental business, the spinoff may improve the company's cash flow, allowing the company to return capital to shareholders.

The spinoff may also give investors access to a pure-play car rental business that may be in recovery after the market was dramatically oversupplied in the years since the financial crisis. Consolidation such as Hertz takeover of Dollar Thrifty, and a recovering economy may also allow rental giants like Hertz, Avis Budget (CAR) and Enterprise to regain their pricing power.

Activist Investors

In December, Third Point Management and Corvex Management were reported as having taken stakes in Hertz, in an effort to unlock value at the car rental giant. Those reported investments came after company's weak third-quarter results, which caused shares to significantly underperform the S&P 500 in the second half of 2013.

Hertz enacted a so-called 'poison pill' in response to high trading volumes in the company's shares and around the time media reports of activist investors surfaced. Third Point repeatedly declined to comment on those reports, and on Tuesday declined to provide any statement.

In a late December note to clients reacting to those media reports, JPMorgan analyst Kevin Milota said Hertz investors were frustrated the company hadn't moved quicker with a sale or spinoff of its capital intensive equipment rental business. Such a transaction could unlock significant free cash flow for Hertz and increase the company's strategic focus on the rental car market, Milota said.

"In our view, if HTZ was to exit the equipment rental business, its free cash flow profile would dramatically increase," the analyst wrote. JPMorgan estimated Hertz would generate $693 million in 2014 free cash flow and $936 million in 2015.

On Tuesday, Milota said in a client note "we believe investors will receive the HERC spin announcement with open arms, offsetting what was otherwise a soft [quarter[ from an operating and full-year 2014 guidance perspective."

Weak Guidance

Hertz on Tuesday said it expected full-year 2014 revenue to be between $11.4-to-$11.7 billion, and EBITDA to be between $2.06 billion-to-$2.42 billion, generally a guidance that was below Wall Street consensus. Earnings per share guidance came in at between $1.70-to-$2.00 a share.

The lukewarm guidance provided by Hertz management underscores the strategic imperative of streamlining its operations and rejiggering the company's capital structure. Those initiatives could help Hertz navigate through supply issues in the car rental industry, for which it is the major culprit.

Hertz cited over-fleeting for an especially weak first quarter adjusted earnings per share guidance and said that the issue could be resolved by the end of the quarter, after dragging on earnings through the second half of 2013.

Management Focus

Hertz continues to integrate its acquisition of Dollar Thrifty and will use the equipment rental spin off to quickly pay down debt assumed in the deal. The acquisition culminated a multi-year effort by Hertz to buy its down-market competitor. It may also come to the forefront of Hertz strategy given the company's efforts to streamline business lines and re-configure its capital structure towards expanded returns of capital to investors.

Whether Hertz initiates a dividend is still to be seen. Hertz shares fell less than 1% in Tuesday trading, closing at $27.08. Shares have gained over 27% over the past 12-months.

-- Written by Antoine Gara in New York##3158|Maker of the hit game Candy Crush Saga, King, has reportedly filed for an IPO in the US to raise an estimated 532.8 million dollars.

The European maker filed an updated F-1 with the SEC, pricing its 22.2 million shares between 21 dollars and 24 dollars, which would value the company to a staggering 7.6 billion dollars.

According to Tech Crunch, the updated F-1 comes after King filed an initial F-1 with a maximum aggregated offering price of 500 million dollars.

In December 2013, King said that 128 million daily active users were playing its games more than 1.2 billion times per day.

In its updated filing, the company noted that in February 2014, an average of 144 million daily active users played our games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

The company announced that Candy Crush Saga, their top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time, as it alone brings in some 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game plays.

It has been believed that the main reason to go public could be to get the best possible price from a strategic acquirer.

The report added that the company, behind other popular free-to-play games like Pet Rescue Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Papa Pear Saga and Bubble Witch Saga, would trade as KING on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) when it goes public.##3159|Vodafone has bought Spain's Ono telecom firm for €7.2bn. The deal will see the company significantly expand its presence throughout mainland Europe

Months after UK telecom multinational Vodafone announced it was retreating from its US operations, the company has made an effort to refocus its expansion plans on Europe. This morning a deal to buy Spain’s Ono telecom firm added to a number of strategic acquisitions across Europe in recent months.

The deal, worth €7.2bn, comes almost eight months after Vodafone announced it was selling its stake in US giant Verizon Wireless for a colossal $130bn, and six months after Vodafone bought Germany’s largest cable firm Kabel Deutschland for €7.7bn.

The company is looking to press ahead with expansion throughout mainland Europe as it tries to wrestle back control of the telecom market from a number of competitors that have sprung up in recent years.

CEO Vittorio Colao has told reporters that the Ono deal represented an “attractive value creation opportunity” for his firm. “Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the past few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.”

While Vodafone has cut its ties with Verizon, another US telecoms giant has been rumoured to be looking at buying a stake for many months. AT&T was reportedly set to take a position in Vodafone as a result of its Verizon sale, but in mid-March the firm’s CEO, Randall Stephenson, played down the prospects of such a bid.

He told an investor conference that time is running out for his firm investing in European wireless operators, after UK regulators forced it to rule out making a bid for six months earlier this year. He pointed to the number of operators boosting their LTE operations in recent years, meaning there was little value to be found for US investors. “Europe way underinvested for quite some period of time in terms of LTE. What we had always believed was going to transpire is now transpiring.”

He added, “As you see these investments happening, you may kind of begin to think the window may be closing on perhaps owning wireless assets.”##3160|Empty##3161|By continuing to use this site you consent to the use of cookies on your device as described in our Cookie Policy unless you have disabled them.

“The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it,” said a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

“The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea,” he said.

A second GNC member confirmed the vessel's escape and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.

A government source and a spokesman for Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel's escape when contacted by AFP.

Libyan authorities had said late Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the Al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for ex-rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading Al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.

Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil but the North Korean-flagged Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, is the first to actually do so.

The standoff at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels per day to just 250,000, dealing a massive blow to the North African country's key revenue earner.##3165|Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced a massive hacker offensives last month, coming under 150,000 denial-of-service attacks a second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report says.

But there’s also the punitive side of the law: how much those who don’t enroll will have to pay at tax time next year.

The deadline to enroll is coming fast — March 31 — and many people don’t realize they could be paying far more than the $95 flat fee talked about in the early days of the law, according to enrollment counselors, income tax preparation agents and accountants.

Depending on the size of their households and income levels, not enrolling for Obamacare can run into hundreds of dollars, and for a few higher-income earners, possibly thousands.

Brian Haile, senior vice president of health policy for the Jackson Hewitt Tax Service based in Parsippany, said most people in the early days of the program recall talk about a $95 flat fee due next year for not complying with the law. But Haile said there was a second part to that equation: The fee is either $95 for adults and $47.50 per child or 1 percent of their gross adjusted income, whichever is greater.

“It’s been a good news and bad news session with any number of clients,” Haile said. “A lot of people coming in assume they have to pay this year, and when I tell them you do not have to pay until next year, there is a sense a relief. But then I explain it’s more than $95, and the anxiety goes right up. We explain to them $95 is the least you will have to pay, and you are very likely to pay considerably more.”

For example, a couple earning $68,000 where only one has health insurance would owe 1 percent of their income if that person doesn’t sign up. After subtracting the first $20,300 of their income not taxed by the IRS for couples who file jointly, the couple would end up paying $477 next year, Haile said.

Jim Logan of Mount Ephraim, a certified application counselor hired by the New Jersey Hospital Association to assist the enrollment drive in the state, has encountered similar confusion.

“In my experience, they are equating the penalty with $95. When told the full extent, most people are aghast,” Morgan said. “As far as what they plan to do, most decide to get the insurance.”

People who decline to buy coverage would have the penalties deducted from their tax refund, which Haile called “quite an enforcement tool” considering three out of four families qualify for a refund at an average of $3,000. It’s not clear what would happen to those who don’t get a tax refund.

Joel Cantor, director for Rutgers Center for State Health Policy, said it’s easier to show the benefits of enrolling for people with modest incomes who are eligible for subsidies to help pay for coverage.

He said those with higher incomes would be hit harder, noting a family of four making $95,000 would get a meager subsidy. For families above that threshold, the penalty “could be $10,000 or $11,000 a year, and you can buy a plan for that.”

There is a limit to the fee. It can’t be more than the average price of the least expensive “bronze” level health plan available through the marketplace, according to the law. But that could run up to $3,600 per adult plus $1,900 per child, according to the Tax Policy Center, founded by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.

There are many exceptions to the rules. There’s no penalty for people who don’t file income taxes because they earn too little. Married people who file jointly and earn below $20,300 and single people who earn less than $10,050 also won’t be penalized, according to the IRS.

Sometimes people are “pleasantly surprised” when they study the details of the law and “learn they qualify for Medicaid or their children may qualify for the children’s health insurance program,” Haile said.

Medicaid is available for a family of four making $31,322 or less or a childless adult earning no more than $15,282. The March 31 enrollment cut-off for private insurance does not apply for Medicaid and people may sign up year-round. The federally run health exchange in New Jersey has signed up 74,000 in private insurance and 123,000 for Medicaid.

Supporters of the health care law say many people don’t know about Obamacare details because the state hasn’t done enough to inform the public. The Christie administration missed a deadline last month to use a $7.6 million federal grant to promote the health exchange, and the state has not spent money specifically to promote the health exchanges.

Justine Ceserano, director for the New Jersey chapter of Get Covered America, which is heading the outreach effort to enroll people, said much of their focus is on the benefits of getting covered.

“While we certainly provide accurate information about the fine to anyone who inquires about it, we focus more on the financial help that is available through the marketplace, which many uninsured New Jerseyans still don’t know about,” Ceserano said. “Our research shows that people are more likely to respond to information about financial help and the fact that they can avoid paying a fine if they sign up by March 31 than to the specifics of the penalty.”

Louis Feuerstein, a partner in the accounting firm ParenteBeard in Philadelphia, agreed people don’t fully grasp the nuances involving the fines, but he believes it’s a secondary concern. “They want health care,” Feuerstein said. “They want to be covered.”

Note: A sentence was clarified in this story and changed to this: He said those with higher incomes would be hit harder, noting a family of four making $95,000 would get a meager subsidy. For families above that threshold, the penalty “could be $10,000 or $11,000 a year, and you can buy a plan for that.”



The Kaiser Family Foundation and Jackson Hewitt offer more information about premium costs and penalties.

More Politics##3167|(Newser) – General Motors is facing more pressure over its handling of a deadly defect in certain compact cars as word leaked of a criminal investigation and two congressional committees opened inquiries into the matter. The Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars, including the Cobalt, from model years 2003 to 2007, says a person briefed on the matter. The probe is being handled by the US Attorney's Office in New York and is in its early stages, reports Reuters.

At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade. The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths. Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government's road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, didn't take action sooner. If no criminal charges result, federal prosecutors could pursue civil charges, notes the New York Times.

Close##3169|Empty##3170|Image copyright AFP Image caption Information was stolen via the web accounts of MtGox boss Mark Karpeles

Hackers have taken over some of the web accounts of Mark Karpeles - boss of the troubled MtGox Bitcoin exchange.

The attack on Mr Karpeles seems to have been motivated by growing frustration over the actions of MtGox.

Last month MtGox stopped trading and filed for bankruptcy after finding out that $465m (£279m) in bitcoins had been lost via a security bug.

Many have called on the exchange to release more information about what happened to the lost bitcoins.

The attacks were mounted on the personal blog and Reddit account of Mr Karpeles and left the hackers in charge of both social media accounts.

The attackers used their access to grab detailed information about trading activity at MtGox. They then shared their findings by posting a 716MB file containing much of what they had found.

The material posted included an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million trades, entries from MtGox's business ledger and information about its back-office administration software.

"It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed," wrote the hackers in a message accompanying the data dump. The word "Goxed" has been used to describe the sudden interruptions in trading MtGox imposed when it was going through technical problems before its final closure.

It was not yet clear whether the information dumps were real or shed new light on what had happened at the exchange, said Forbes staff writer Andy Greenberg.

He pointed out that although $465m in bitcoins (approximately 744,000 coins) had supposedly gone astray from MtGox, no activity suggesting they had been traded had been seen in the blockchain - the central list of buying and selling that underpins the entire Bitcoin network.##3171|Empty##3172|Empty##3173|Good morning. Here's what you need to know.

Chinese exports tumble. Chinese exports fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6% gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data. "Despite our belief that the actual trade situation is better than official data suggests, the disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese yuan(CNY) and the GDP growth outlook for Q1 2014," say economists at Standard Chartered.

Chinese inflation disappoints. China's consumer price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier, marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.

Copper falls. Copper futures slid more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China. However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.

Quiet markets. Futures point to a quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P 500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell 2.9%.

Japan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data suggest Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate. Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from 5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main drags on the headline number.

Record Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a record current account deficit in January of ¥1.589 trillion. The deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade deficit, which widened to ¥2.345 trillion fom ¥1.047 trillion. "Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration of the balance of payments," says Osamu Takashima, a Citi strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month high. A survey of euro zone investor confidence conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to 13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take — the consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this month.

Cross-border lending contracts. The latest data from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of 2013. "International banking activity was characterised by lower credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013, mirroring developments in the previous quarter," said the BIS in its Quarterly Review published Sunday. "Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466 billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late 2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or 4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres ($35 billion or 1.7%)."

Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine. Pro-Russian military forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international watchdogs who tried to enter the region. "Ukraine remains very much a potential dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for safe haven flow," write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a note to clients this morning. "For now, though, the market looks to still be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports informing the market rather than any possible concern over possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports across Ukraine)."

ECB not happy with euro strength. ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is not happy with the euro's recent strength. "It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development," Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. "When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment." The Governing Council declined to announce any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's comments.##3174|This Page Is Under Construction - Coming Soon!

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The co-pilot of a missing Malaysian jetliner spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the airline's chief executive said on Monday, as investigators consider suicide by the captain or first officer as one possible explanation for the disappearance.

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

A search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering an area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.

Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane's automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane - an informal "all right, good night" - was spoken after the tracking system, known as "ACARS", was shut down.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape," Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.

That was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 a.m., as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.

The last transmission from the ACARS system - a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane's status - had been received at 1.07 a.m., as the plane crossed Malaysia's northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.

"We don't know when the ACARS was switched off after that," Ahmad Jauhari said. "It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through."

FOCUS ON CREW

The plane vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian authorities believe that someone on board shut off its communications systems as the plane flew across the Gulf of Thailand.

Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.

Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry,

Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: "We are looking at it." But it was only one of the possibilities under investigation, he added.

Intensive efforts by various governments to investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the airplane had not, as of Monday, turned up any information linking anyone to militant groups or anyone with a known political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the aircraft, U.S. and European security sources said.

One source familiar with U.S. inquiries into the disappearance said the pilots were being studied because of the technical knowledge needed to disable the ACARS system.

Many experts and officials say while the jet's transponder can be switched off by flicking a switch in the cockpit, turning off ACARS may have required someone to open a trap door outside the cockpit, climb down into the plane's belly and pull a fuse or circuit breaker.

Whoever did so, had to have sophisticated knowledge of the systems on a 777, according to pilots and two current and former U.S. officials close to the investigation.

Malaysian police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programmes were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practice flying and landing in different conditions.

A second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group.##3176|Amazon, which has faced criticism about pay and benefits, said it would raise the minimum wage for all U.S. workers.

He pledged the government’s support to the city – a sometimes recalcitrant ally – in maintaining its status as an international financial hub and shipping centre.

“[We will] do everything that benefits Hong Kong's prosperity. That’s what we did in the past, and [that holds true] now,” he said in Beijing on Wednesday, after the concluding ceremony of the National People’s Congress meetings.

“China’s policies to Hong Kong and Macau remain consistent and clear,” Li said.

The premier said Hong Kong played a key role in the country’s “opening up” economic policy, which began in the 1970s.

“Hong Kong has made significant contributions during reforms and the opening up of China,” he said. “Under the process of deepening reforms, Hong Kong will have more development opportunities.”

The premier also cited the city’s ability to weather the global economy’s ups and downs in recent years. “That means Hong Kong has a competitive economy,” Li said.

With the Hong Kong people’s fighting spirit, the city will maintain its edge amid increasing competition in the global market, he said.

Hong Kong, ceded by Britain to China in 1997, works under the “one party, two systems” policy which affords it autonomy in economic, legal and foreign affairs.

In recent months, Hong Kong and Beijing have grappled with the issue of implementing universal suffrage in the territory in three years. Hong Kong has also sought to douse anti-mainlander sentiments from small protest groups.

After months of tense speculation on whether Beijing would weigh in on the issue, the National People's Congress upheld the move towards suffrage as "according to law" and urged a "smooth implementation" of plans for direct elections.

However, Hong Kong lawmakers have been bogged down by bickering over the nomination process for the next chief executive -- whether to let the public or a special committee nominate the candidates.##3178|The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Wednesday, with sentiment suggesting an extension of the downtrend, as the grapple with uncertainties. The lack of any directional cues has intensified the uncertainty concerning the domestic economic outlook, while concerns about the global have also increased in the wake of recent data from China. Global cues are negative, with European stocks declining sharply in the session. Against the backdrop, the markets may witness more selling, although a large scale correction is unlikely.

U.S. stocks declined moderately on Tuesday amid a lack of any major directional cues. The major averages opened higher but moved lower immediately after. After staging a short-lived recovery in late morning trading, the indexes declined steadily throughout the remainder of the session before closing lower.

Asia

The major Asian markets retreated, with the negative lead from Wall Street weighing on the averages in the region. The risk aversion in play in the markets exerted upward pressure on the yen, sending Japanese stocks lower.

Japan's Nikkei 225 average opened lower and moved roughly sideways before ending down 393.72 points or 2.59 percent at 14,830. The market witnessed broad based weakness, with Nisshin Steel, Dainippon Sumitomo, Furukawa, Tokyo Dome and Nissan Chemical Industries leading the declines.

Australia's All Ordinaries also languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before closing 28.80 points or 0.53 percent lower at 5,401. Most sectors moved to the downside, although material and healthcare stocks saw some strength.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 21,902, down 367.66 points or 1.65 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite Index ended 3.47 points or 0.17 percent lower at 1,998.

According to Consumer Reports, approximately 70 percent of retirees’ net wealth is locked up in their homes. Given that statistic, you’d think that reverse mortgages would be a very popular solution for tapping into all that wealth. Yet prior to 2012, the cost, complexity and even stigma of a reverse mortgage have made it the choice of last resort for elderly retirees needing cash.

Things changed beginning in 2012, when the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which insures most reverse mortgages through its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program, created the HECM Saver to lower costs and increase flexibility. Reverse mortgages are now being used not just as a last resort, but as one component of a comprehensive retirement plan.

Benefits

The key benefit of a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners ages 62 and older, is the ability to tap into a portion of your home’s equity value without having to sell your home. You can withdraw a lump sum of money or create a line of credit similar to a home equity line (HELOC), from which you can draw cash when needed.

The amount you can borrow depends on your age (the older you are, the greater the amount), current interest rates and the value of your home.

FROM REVERSEMORTGAGEKDC.COM Nothing needs to be paid back to the lender as long as you or your spouse are alive and living in the home. After you pass away, your estate pays back the principal plus accrued interest to the lender, typically by selling the property. Any remaining equity goes to your heirs. The best part: If there’s not enough equity in the property to cover the loan, the FHA pays the difference to the lender, preserving the remaining assets in the estate for your heirs.

The line of credit option has become the most popular choice, because it offers the most flexibility and incurs the lowest costs. As with a HELOC, if you don’t borrow the money, you don’t pay any interest. Unlike a HELOC, a HECM line of credit cannot be reduced or frozen, and the loan does not become due until your death. The HECM line of credit even grows as you become older, regardless of your home’s value.

Reverse mortgages, however, don’t come for free. There are closing costs and loan origination and servicing fees similar to what you’d incur with a traditional mortgage, not to mention FHA insurance premiums to cover any lender losses from equity declines.

And, of course, there is the interest that you have to pay on the loan, which in the case of a line of credit is variable based on prevailing rates.

All these factors make reverse mortgages more expensive than traditional mortgages. None of these costs has to be paid out-of-pocket. Nonetheless, they do limit the amount you can borrow and also affect the amount of equity your heirs have to sacrifice when your house is eventually sold.

Some additional benefits of a HECM reverse mortgage:

• It’s much easier to qualify for than a traditional mortgage.

• Mandatory independent counseling by a government-trained nonprofit agency before you can apply provides a measure of consumer education and protection.

• Your executor/trustee has up to one year to pay off the loan after repayment becomes due.

The drawbacks

There are downsides to a reverse mortgage as well.

• The loan can be called early due to nonpayment of property taxes, homeowners insurance or failure to adequately maintain the property, potentially forcing you to sell the house prematurely.

• Having extra money available (especially when taken as a lump sum) puts you at risk of spending it too quickly or becoming a target for financial abuse by family or financial advisers. That’s why a reverse mortgage should never be used except as part of a well-thought-through retirement plan.

Alternatives

There are alternatives to a reverse mortgage if you want to access some of the equity built up in your home. The simplest is to downsize by selling your current home and either buying or renting a less expensive, smaller house. Alternatively, if your adult children have the financial wherewithal, you can create a sale-leaseback arrangement in which you sell the house to one (or more) of your children and then rent it back using the cash you get from the sale. Your children benefit by getting rental income and tax write-offs (as long as you structure the transaction properly, according to the IRS), and you get the cash. However, once the lease expires, your children have the right to kick you out. You may not be comfortable giving up that degree of control over your home.

A private reverse mortgage is another option. You’ll benefit because your children will charge you less than commercial lenders, your up-front costs will be lower and there won’t be ongoing mortgage-insurance expenses. Plus the interest rate – which the IRS sets each month – will be lower than what commercial lenders charge. But again, it’s important to structure the deal so that it passes muster with the IRS.

Reverse mortgages have emerged as a viable retirement planning tool as long as they are used carefully and thoughtfully. The more tools we have, the better the likelihood that we can afford to do all the things in our later years that we’d always hoped to do.

“We must back away from increasing the degree of policy accommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy,” Plosser told a panel in Paris. “Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts.”

Based on the latest gross domestic product numbers, the U.S. economy accelerated its pace of expansion in the second half of 2013 from the first half. Real output showed growth of 3.3% from 1.8% in the first half.

As the economic outlook improves, the Fed announced in January its second cut to its monthly purchase program to $65 billion. At the current pace, the FOMC will end the purchase program later this year.

But Plosser noted the pace may not be fast enough.

“If the economy continues to improve, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an environment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the opposite direction,” Plosser said.

He also raised concerns about how the Fed might ultimately reduce the size of its balance sheet without disrupting inflation or the economy.

“Knock on wood it would all go very smoothly, but you never know,” he said in a question-and-answer session after the speech.

The Obama administration is requiring health plans in Obamacare insurance marketplaces to include a more robust offering of care providers in 2015 after some early backlash over limited networks in the health care law's first year.

Health plans selling on the federal marketplaces in 2015 must include 30 percent of area "essential community providers," which are usually health centers and other hospitals serving mostly low-income patients. That's up from a 20 percent requirement in 2014, the first year of expanded overage under the health care law.

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the marketplaces, will also take a much more active role in reviewing health plan networks. CMS, which outlined the new standards in a Friday night letter to insurers, will evaluate whether the plans include enough access to hospitals, primary care doctors, mental health providers and oncologists.

The updated standards came after a Friday interview in which President Barack Obama acknowledged that pressure to keep down costs could mean consumers may not have access to their choice of doctor.

“You may find out that network is more expensive than another network, then you have to make choices in terms of what’s right for your family,” Obama told WebMD. “Do you want to save on costs, or do you want to save on convenience?”

A senior administration official defended the health law’s standards in a Friday afternoon statement.

“What is what true before the health law is true today insurers have always made decisions about which providers and doctors are in their networks – that won’t change,” the official said. “What is different now is the Affordable Care Act marks the first time that federal law requires insurance plans to offer adequate networks of doctors, including mental health practitioners, pharmacies, hospitals, and community providers. Americans can now choose between different types of plans with different networks to find a plan that best meets their needs.”

CMS late Friday night also released a slew of new standards related to the insurance marketplaces, also known as exchanges. For instance, the agency issued new rules related to in-person Obamacare assisters, known as navigators. It also builds on small business insurance marketplaces, which have face several delays in the law's rollout.

CMS also said it will excuse insurers' administrative spending for costs stemming from the failed roll out of Healthcare.gov. The health law requires insurers to provide rebates to customers if they spend more than 20 percent of premium dollars on administrative costs, but CMS says it won't count administrative costs related to the enrollment website's turbulent launch.##3189|The U.S. administration said on Monday that more than 5 million people have now enrolled in private health insurance under the program known as Obamacare, since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.

The tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that enrollment could total 6 million, but private estimates have suggested a lower turnout.

The announcement, in a government blog posted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, did not say how many new enrollees are the younger adults that President Barack Obama needs to make his new health insurance marketplaces a success.

But Tavenner said the pace of enrollment has been at its highest since late December, when there was a rush of interest from people who wanted coverage beginning Jan. 1.

She said the federal website HealthCare.gov had 1 million online visitors over the weekend and more than 4 million visitors last week. A federal call center set up to take applications over the telephone had more than 198,000 calls last Thursday.##3190|After moving lower over the course of the two previous sessions, stocks may see some further downside in early trading on Wednesday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the , with the Dow futures down by 51 points.

Considerable weakness in the overseas markets is likely to weigh on the markets, with stocks in both Asia and Europe coming under pressure on the day.

Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, "With today's declines, most major European markets are at or below the closing lows of March 3rd, the Monday when markets finally reacted lower to Putin's war games."

"In Asia, the Shanghai, Hang Seng, Kospi, ASX, Singapore Straits and Japanese Topix are also at or near the March 3rd close but also are being influenced by China's growth concerns," he added.

While concerns about China and Ukraine are also likely to weigh on U.S. stocks, trading activity may be somewhat subdued amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front.

Traders may continue to look ahead to the release of closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices over the next two days.

Among individual stocks, shares of Express (EXPR) are seeing significant weakness in pre-market trading after the apparel retailer reported weaker than expected fourth quarter results and provided disappointing first quarter guidance.

Russian mobile phone operator VimpelCom (VIP) may also come under pressure amid news the company is being investigated by U.S. and Dutch authorities in connection with its in Uzbekistan.

On the other hand, shares of VeriFone (PAY) are likely to see early strength after the maker of card-payment systems reported better than expected first quarter results and provided upbeat guidance.

After initially showing a lack of direction, stocks moved mostly lower over the course of the trading day on Tuesday. The major averages added to the slim losses posted on Monday, with the S&P 500 pulling back further off last Friday's record highs.

The major averages climbed off their worst levels going into the close but remained firmly in the red. The Dow fell 67.43 points or 0.4 percent to 16,351.25, the Nasdaq slid 27.26 points or 0.6 percent to 4,307.19 and the S&P 500 dropped 9.54 points or 0.5 percent to 1,867.63.

In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw significant weakness during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index plunged by 2.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.7 percent.

The major European markets have also come under pressure on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has fallen by 1.2 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are down by 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.

In commodities trading, crude oil futures are falling $1.49 to $98.54 a barrel after sliding $1.09 to $100.03 a barrel on Tuesday. An ounce of gold is trading at $1,366.70, up $20 from the previous session's close of $1,346.70. On Tuesday, gold added $5.20.

Among currencies, the U.S. dollar is trading at 102.65 yen compared to the 103.02 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.3897 compared to yesterday's $1.3860.

A new study by Bankrate.com shows that about one third of uninsured Americans are going to remain without coverage and opt to pay the penalty.

The survey results suggest that the administration’s outreach to uninsured people may be falling short, with more than half of people without insurance unaware of the March 31 deadline—and even more unaware of subsidies that could make their policies more affordable.

Related: Obamacare May Be Failing the Uninsured

Bankrate surveyed 3,005 people and found that 41 percent of those who were uninsured said they plan to stay uninsured because they think that health insurance is too costly. Meanwhile, about 70 percent said they were unaware of subsidies available under the new law that could make their health plans more affordable.

The study’s findings are worrisome for the Obama administration since the key goal of the president’s health care law was to extend access to health coverage for the uninsured.

A separate study by the McKinsey consulting firm found just 27 percent of Obamacare enrollees were uninsured. That means that the majority of those signing up for Obamacare had previous insurance of some kind—whether they were kicked off their old policies, or they found a better deal on the exchanges. Though not confirmed by the White House, if accurate, that could mean the law is failing to meet its intended goal.

Related: Gallup: Employment, Obamacare Lower Uninsured Rate

Gary Cohen, an official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the administration has not been tracking how many of the Obamacare enrollees were previously uninsured.

“That's not a data point we are really collecting in any sort of systematic way,” Cohen told an audience at a health policy conference in Washington.

However, a separate poll from Gallup shows that the uninsured rate is at its lowest rate in the last five years—and the pollsters say Obamacare may deserve part of the credit. Of course, the uninsured rate is also tied to the lower unemployment rate, which could also explain the decline.

Still, the Bankrate survey found one bright spot for the White House—about 66 percent of young people between the ages of 18-29 said they are planning to sign up for coverage. This is crucial since the Obama administration has stressed from the beginning the importance of enrolling a strong mix of young and healthy people to offset the costs for older, sicker Americans.

Through February, young people made up about 27 percent of total enrollees--well below the White House’s 40 percent benchmark. Still, administration officials have repeatedly said they expect a crush of young people to sign up ahead of the March 31 deadline.

Related: Uninsured Still Unaware of Obamacare Deadline

Under the law’s individual mandate, those who do not sign up for health coverage before March 31, will be subject to a penalty of 1 percent of their annual income. However, under rules issued by the administration, millions of people will likely be exempt from paying that penalty through a provision called the “hardship exemption,” which was extended last week through 2016.

This allows anyone who believes they will have a “hardship in obtaining insurance,” including homeless people, or those who have foreclosed upon, can apply for the exemption.

Critics of the provision say it is too ambiguous and could potentially allow anyone to skirt around the penalty.

“Quietly, without any fanfare, there’s a real question about whether the White House has just abandoned the individual mandate, the heart of Obamacare itself,” Boehner said a news conference last week. “This is a huge public policy decision that could affect millions of Americans.”

Top Reads from The Fiscal Times:##3193|Healthcare

The Washington Post heralds the arrival of the new Republican plan for a post ObamaCare-world:

House Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation’s health-care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together. The tenets of the plan — which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations — are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills. But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with lawmakers outlining the plan, called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,” with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents. “We’ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in an interview. “We’ve got all of these bills out there, so we’re going to take this core of policies and grow from there.”

The key phrase here is “the first time this year.” Republicans have put forth several other alternatives over the past four years, including a few other working-group products that were meant to be the party’s “official alternative” to ObamaCare. But the media let Democrats get away with pretending none of these plans existed. One of President Obama’s most frequently repeated, and categorically false, talking points is that nobody has any alternative suggestions to his disastrous Affordable Care Act. In the very same Washington Post article that describes the 2014 Republican alternative, Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) is quoted pretending the new plan doesn’t exist.

So Republican leaders are basically surfing on the media tide by treating this as the grand unveiling of a brand-new package, even though most of the (quite excellent) ideas they’re teasing have been part of earlier proposals Democrats were able to wish away into the cornfield. This might prove to be an effective bit of political and media judo, because 2014 feels like a brand-new shuffle and cut of the electoral cards, and voters will see the official Republican plan as an entirely fresh and new replacement for the widely hated ACA. (The Post tries to buck up lil’ campers on the Democrat reservation by citing an ostensibly reassuring poll that has “support for the Affordable Care Act ticking up slightly”… to 39 percent, with 57 percent disapproval.)

The new Republican plan will debut amid much buzz about President Obama’s falling approval ratings, public disgust with the endless and nakedly political revisions to the ACA, and the meaning of the special election in Florida’s District 13. The underdog Republican victory in that race might have persuaded the leadership it’s time to bring out a plan they can run with, in unison, during the midterm elections. Until now, it has been thought that exposing a GOP alternative to Democrat attacks could be a tactical mistake, giving Dems a chance to change the subject away from the ongoing ObamaCare disaster. Some conservative strategists evidently still feel that way, but others think it will be difficult to fully capitalize on the public revolt against ObamaCare without a solid alternative on the table.

If the House package draws wide acclaim once its details are unveiled, the next step will be to get Senate Republicans on board. If the party’s efforts are split between too many conflicting alternatives, their signals will all be lost in media static – they should have learned that by now. On the other hand, every headline-grabbing ObamaCare horror story gives them another chance to say, “Under our plan, these things won’t happen,” coupled with frequent reminders of all those broken ObamaCare promises and absurdly inaccurate predictions.

Barack Obama is illegally waiving huge chunks of the Affordable Care Act just to keep his party alive during the 2014 election. That’s a terrific setup for the GOP to come together behind a superior alternative proposal… a law so good the government might actually obey it.##3194|Sponsored

Its projected valuation is as outrageous as expected. King (and its existing shareholders) plan to sell more than twenty-two million shares at a price of twenty-one to twenty-four dollars apiece, which would give the company a projected market cap of around seven billion dollars. That’s two billion more than Zynga’s market cap, and, even more strikingly, just a few billion dollars less than the market caps of the gaming giants Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.

The enormous profits that King is raking in from Candy Crush makes the company look reasonably priced on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, with a trailing P/E ratio of just 13.3. At Yahoo Finance, Aaron Pressman argues that when you compare King’s valuation to those of other tech high-flyers (which often have P/Es above a hundred), there’s a case to be made that it’s undervalued. The problem, of course, is that this assumes that King’s current profits are sustainable, not just for a couple of years but for the foreseeable future. Price-to-earnings ratios are crude tools at best, and they’re useful only if the “earnings” part can be counted on to be stable or growing. In King’s case, as I argued in my column, there’s just no reason to assume that Candy Crush—which brings in eighty per cent of King’s revenue—is going to keep generating enormous piles of cash for years to come. Nor can it be expected that King will come up with sequels that replicate Candy Crush’s success.

When you buy shares in a public company, you’re buying a share of future profits, and the future of any company that’s reliant on a single faddish product for so much of its revenue is inherently uncertain—too uncertain for investors to confidently accept a seven-billion-dollar valuation. I have no doubt that investors will snap this offering up: the market is willing to value Zynga, which has lost six hundred million dollars over the past three years, at five billion dollars. King looks like a bargain by comparison. But this is a pure gamble.

Pressman alludes to the fact that there are successful video-game franchises. But, almost without exception, those franchises are titles in which companies invest huge sums of money, and many of them (like sports franchises) have a natural upgrade cycle built in: people buy the new Madden like clockwork when football season starts again. King has yet to demonstrate that it’ll be able to do anything similar with Candy Crush.

King’s offering does make clear just why the company is going public—to allow its current shareholders to make a whole lot of money. The company itself is planning to raise about three hundred and twenty-five million dollars. Shareholders are going to sell shares worth another hundred and fifty million, which represents a very nice payday, particularly since many of those shares will be sold by individuals. (The private-equity firm Apax Partners, which owns nearly half the company, is going to dilute its stake by only four per cent.) Going public, as I argued in my piece, still seems like a mistake for a company that has more than enough money in the bank to stay afloat for years to come (and is going to be generating hundreds of millions of dollars annually for the next couple of years), and that operates a business ill-suited to the demands of shareholders, who want consistent and steadily growing profits. But there are few better ways to make a lot of people really rich than a high-priced I.P.O., and, looking at these numbers, it’s not hard to understand why King’s current shareholders are happy to take the money. Whether future shareholders will ever be quite as pleased, though, is another question.

Vivendi Hunts For The Right Telecom Exit

The traditional shoppers' warning is caveat emptor, or "buyer beware". When Vivendi's board meets on Friday to choose between two bids for its French telecom unit SFR, "seller beware" may be more appropriate. Both offers - from conglomerate Bouygues and local cable operator Numericable - leave Vivendi with a significant minority stake in the newly-created operator and continued exposure to the French telecom market, which has been in the throes of a price war since 2012.##3204|(Reuters) - Hertz Global Holdings Inc (HTZ.N) said it would spin off its equipment rental business, raising $2.5 billion to reduce debt and fund a $1 billion share buyback.

Hertz, the No. 2 U.S. car rental company behind privately owned Enterprise Rent-A-Car, has been under pressure from investors to shed the business and focus on car rentals.

The equipment business, which rents out equipment ranging from small tools to earth movers, generated revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2013, about 14 percent of Hertz’s total revenue.

The company said the spinoff would involve a one-time payment of $2.5 billion from the rental business along with a tax-free distribution to shareholders.

Hertz’s shares, which have risen 28 percent in the past year, were down 0.26 percent at $27.15 in late-afternoon trading on Tuesday.

Hertz’s remaining businesses would include the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly car rental brands and the Donlen fleet leasing and management business.

The company put in place a poison pill in December to ward off any takeover attempts at a time when activist investors such as Daniel Loeb’s Third Point Capital were buying up shares.

Hertz operates in a consolidated market, along with Avis Budget Group Inc (CAR.O) and Enterprise, which together control about 90 percent of the U.S. car rental market.

Hertz, which gets about 50 percent of its revenue from airport rentals, is expected to get a boost in 2014 as spending on business and leisure travel picks up in a recovering U.S. economy.

The new company, Hertz Equipment Rental Corp (HERC), is expected to benefit from a recovery in non-residential construction. Its biggest competitor is market leader United Rentals Inc (URI.N).

“One of the challenges or opportunities for the HERC management team post the spinoff would be to improve operational deliveries - both pricing and time utilization,” Jefferies analyst Justin Jordan said. Time utilization is a measure of the time equipment is rented out during a year.

Hertz said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter adjusted net profit fell 13 percent to $121.1 million due to lower-than-expected rental prices and higher expenses. Revenue rose 10.2 percent to $2.56 billion.

BofA Merrill Lynch and Barclays were financial advisers to Hertz for the spinoff. Jenner & Block LLP and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP provided legal counsel, while KPMG was tax adviser.

The spinoff will close by early 2015, Hertz said.##3205|Libya MPs oust struggling leader BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Libya's parliament has ousted the prime minister in a vote of confidence, after his government was embarrassed when a militia controlling an eastern port defied Tripoli's authority by trying to sell oil. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/libya-mps-oust-struggling-leader-30083336.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article30083335.ece/1bfd0/AUTOCROP/h342/PANews%20BT_P-01a71356-5895-4c11-b334-5be196a222ef_I1.jpg

Libya's parliament has ousted the prime minister in a vote of confidence, after his government was embarrassed when a militia controlling an eastern port defied Tripoli's authority by trying to sell oil.

The chamber named the defence minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, as an interim prime minister until a replacement for the embattled Ali Zidan is found.

The "no" vote won the support of 121 MPs out of the approximately 180 that remain in the parliament, according to one MP.

Mr Zidan, whose ousting had been seen as a matter of time to many Libyans, had no immediate public reaction to the vote.

He was elected in 2012 as the first prime minister after the 2011 overthrow and killing of dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

He has had the backing of the liberal-leaning National Forces Alliance against a bloc led by the Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, although parliament is divided as much on regional lines as ideological ones.

Col Gaddafi's 40-year rule left Libya with few strong state institutions, and Mr Zidan has presided over a government that has little authority and is frequently subjected to humiliations. In the absence of a strong military and police force, it relies on militias to keep order - but many defy the government, with one of them briefly abducting Mr Zidan himself last year.

The Islamist-led bloc has long wanted to oust him, although until now it could not drum up the votes. It was not clear if parliament changed sides but Mr Zidan in recent days has appeared particularly helpless. He confessed to reporters on Saturday that the nation's military does not carry out his orders and complained that "everyone is working against the government."

The latest crisis is linked to an autonomy movement in Libya's east, home to most of its oil. Several months ago, a militia seized the key port of al-Sidra and in recent days, the group attempted to load oil into a North Korean-flagged tanker that docked there without government permission.

The government said on Monday that its forces had taken control of the tanker, but the militia denied this.

Underlying Libya's crisis is a dispute over the interim parliament, which reached the end of its mandate in February. Islamists want to extend its term while the other bloc wants new elections.##3206|Empty##3207|Empty##3208|Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signalled on Thursday that his government will not ride to the rescue of every troubled investment by saying some loan defaults are "hard to avoid" in what he called a challenging economic environment.

Japan News notes that it doesn't require any special skill to launch a DDOS attack, citing Tetsutaro Uehara, a professor of information security at Ritsumeikan University: “DDoS attacks can be done without high-level hacking techniques.”

Referring to attacks on Slovenian Bitstamp and Canada's Flexcoin, Uehara said: “It is possible that copycats turned their eyes on other exchanges after weaknesses in Mt. Gox’s system were found.”

By February 10, Mt Gox threw its hands up in the air and suspended Bitcoin withdrawals. It later emerged that attackers had found a way to exploit the Mt Gox code to steal 850,000 Bitcoins worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Of the stolen Bitcoins, 750,000 belonged to customers and 100,000 were Mt Gox's own holdings.

Mt Gox is under investigation in the US and Japan. ®

Reporting sales and earnings ahead of expectations, Dick’s Sporting Goods says its omnichannel strategy is paying off. And with its new “Sports Matter” campaign, announced last week at SXSW, the Pittsburgh-based retailer is shifting its brand advertising dollars into the broader support of kids’ athletics, addressing the funding crisis facing its core audience.

“We’ve been working on this crowdfunding campaign for about a year,” Ryan Eckel, VP-brand marketing, tells Marketing Daily, “and while we inherently knew that massive benefits come from sports, it’s been really powerful to quantify them.” For example, he says, 95% of Fortune 500 CEOs played a high school sport, and kids who do so are four times as likely to go on to college. “But opportunities are disappearing fast,” he says, with 60% of kids participating in team sports now having to pay in order to play. And by 2020, an estimated 27% of high schools will not offer athletics.

While he declined to give the dollar amount of the marketing effort, he says the company is moving its brand budget into the “Sports Matter” TV ads, created by Anomaly. The goal is to help threatened teams raise $2 million, which will then be matched by a $2 million grant from Dick’s Sporting Goods Foundation.

So far, he says the response has strong, “and we can see activity increase whenever a spot runs.”

In order to participate, teams must serve kids in grades K through 12, be affiliated with a school, nonprofit or league, and have been eliminated, at risk of elimination or never able to form because of lack of funds. “We wanted to focus on the sharpest outcome, the extreme outcome, when entire teams disappear,” he says. “With that clear an identity, we thought the campaign would get more traction.”

The crowdfunding element is important. “If we just write these teams a check and then go away, that’s not a sustainable solution,” he says. Once the funding has been awarded, he adds, teams will work with Up2Us, an online organization that coaches parents on how to build effective extracurricular organizations.

Jon Gruden, a former NFL coach and now an ESPN analyst, is an ambassador for the program.

Another part of the effort, Eckel says, is a partnership with Tribeca Digital Studios and director Judd Ehrlich, filming “We Could be King,” a documentary that follows the merger of two rival Philadelphia high schools forced to merge football teams. That film is set to premiere next month at the Tribeca Film Festival, and will also air on ESPN2.

Separately, the company says its net sales rose nearly 8% in the fourth quarter, to $1.9 billion. On a same-store basis, sales increased 7.3%, and net income climbed to $138.6 million. Sales “exceeded our expectations," says Edward W. Stack, chairman and CEO, in its release. "As we look to 2014, we believe our robust and growing omni-channel network and exciting merchandising opportunities will support double-digit growth in earnings."##3214|“A supplier raised with the Company a concern about the performance of a component that accommodates Ready Alert Braking, a Chrysler Group safety system that primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop.

After nudging the value of the renminbi down by more than 1.6% against the U.S. dollar since January to its lowest level in 15 years, the People’s Bank of China said over the weekend that the currency would be able to trade as much as 2% higher or lower than the daily rate it sets.

Currencies rarely move so much in a single day, particularly not China’s tightly controlled yuan. But unlikely doesn’t mean impossible — so one can reasonably expect Chinese companies and the banks that service them to start hedging against the risk of higher volatility in the currency’s rate.##3217|Empty##3218|We’ve recently covered the news that more people are foregoing car ownership than ever before, so it would make sense that public transit is becoming more and more popular at the same time. Now there’s data to prove it.

The American Public Transportation Association’s latest figures, released today, show that more Americans used public transit in 2013 than at any time in nearly 60 years. That amounts to a whopping 10.65 billion passenger trips, beating the previous record in 1956 and a more recent peak in 2008, when gas cost more than $4 a gallon and 10.59 million trips were taken.

This time around high gas prices aren’t the main reason, and the trend is more about a basic shift in attitudes about how people travel in their cities, as well as a generally strong urban economy. Michael Melaniphy, president of the advocacy group, told the New York Times:

“Now gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers,” Mr. Melaniphy said in an interview. “We’re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities.”

From 1995 to 2013, transit ridership rose 37 percent, well ahead of a 20 percent growth in population and a 23 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled, according to the association’s data.

Cities should be paying attention, especially as many aim to attract young people to live and work in their borders. Young people traveling more often at “off-peak” times accounted for some of the increases seen over the last year, the New York Times reported. Public transit agencies reporting the biggest ridership increases included those in smaller cities, such as Ann Arbor, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; Flagstaff, Arizona; and Riverside, California.

These are all reasons for cities to invest more in subways, buses, and rail systems though that is sure to raise the hackles of dedicated drivers. It may pay to note, however, more than 70% of transit tax efforts succeeded in the last two years, according to the association.##3219|This Page Is Under Construction - Coming Soon!

Moments after Herbalife made the announcement, its stock price plunged. At 1:51 p.m., it had lost 12 percent of its value.

Bloomberg explains that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman accused the company of running a pyramid scheme. Bloomberg adds:



"The probe marks an achievement for Ackman, who in 2012 made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife's shares and started working to persuade regulators to shut the company down, saying it misleads distributors, misrepresents sales figures and sells a commodity product at inflated prices. The company has repeatedly denied Ackman's allegations and won allies including billionaire Carl Icahn. "'Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,' the company said in the statement."



NPR's Planet Money took a look at Ackman's claims back in January. As they reported, the "multilevel marketing" scheme used by Herbalife isn't new. Amway and Avon use the same kind of structure. Essentially, distributors make more money by making other people distributors.

But whether its illegal presents a complicated question:



"Ackman argues that Herbalife is all about recruiting new distributors, and not about selling weight loss shakes and vitamins to real customers. "Not surprisingly, Herbalife disagrees. The company says it has millions of customers around the world. The CEO went on CNBC and accused Ackman of 'market manipulation' — a typical accusation CEOs hurl against shorts. "So, who's right here? How hard can it be to tell whether a giant company is a pyramid scheme? In this case, weirdly, it's really hard. "For a company like Herbalife, the difference between being a legitimate business and being a pyramid scheme comes down to what happens on the ground with all those people who signed up to sell products. "If it's a legitimate business, they're mostly selling the products to people who actually want to use them."

U.S. Navy SEALs have taken control of a commercial tanker that had been seized by three armed Libyans earlier this month.

No one was hurt in the Sunday night operation, the Pentagon said.

The tanker, Morning Glory, is carrying oil owned by Libya’s National Oil Company.

It sailed last week from the rebel-held port of As-Sidra in the nation’s east. Libyan forces fired on the vessel but were called off by the U.S. Navy, fearing an environmental disaster.

The situation remains unsettled in the North African nation, which the government is struggling to control more than two years after the ouster of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

In this case, the issue centers around the oil-rich eastern part of the country and one man in particular, Ibrahim Jadran. The militia leader was entrusted by the government to safeguard crucial oil ports. But last July, Jadran and his men seized them, blocking oil exports, and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region.

He said he acted because the government is corrupt.

The conflict over oil wealth is stoking fears Libya may slide deeper into chaos as the fragile government fails to rein in the armed brigades that helped oust Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 but now do as they please.

DETROIT, March 13 — General Motors Co got its first internal report on ignition-switch problems in small cars in 2001, while developing the Saturn Ion, the carmaker said in a letter to US regulators.

GM thought it had fixed the ignition-switch defect, the carmaker said in a supplemental report filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration yesterday. Then in 2003, service technicians found that an owner with a heavy key ring was experiencing engine stalls while driving. The flaw, linked to 12 deaths, led to the recall last month of 1.6 million cars.

The company filed the new information with NHTSA on what it did to address the problem to better explain why it expanded the recall to six US models from two, roughly doubling the number of cars covered, Greg Martin, a spokesman for Detroit-based GM, said in an e-mail. The details concern the company’s attempts to investigate ignition-switch issues in the Ion, the Saturn Sky, the Chevrolet HHR and the Pontiac Solstice.

“Today’s GM is fully committed to learning from the past while embracing the highest standards for quality and performance now and in the future,” Martin said.

GM later used the same part in the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.

The 2001 testing failure disclosed by GM is earlier than when the carmaker said it learned of flaws in the Cobalt. Previously, the company said it had investigated in 2004 a consumer complaint and engineers were able to induce an engine stall. GM officials have said the problem was investigated at that time and no action was taken.

Frontal crashes

“We don’t yet really know at what point this matter was escalated to past upper-level members of management, and how they dealt with it,” said Alec Gutierrez, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book in Irvine, California. “It’s also murky as to when current management learned about some of this.”

The flaw caused ignition switches to slip out of position and cut off engine power and deactivate air bags.

The largest US automaker said it knows of eight frontal- impact crashes and four deaths involving Ions that may be linked to the defect. It knows of three frontal crashes involving the HHR that may be related, which caused three injuries but no fatalities, it said.

The recalled cars are the 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2006-07 Chevy HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice, 2007 Saturn Sky, 2007 Pontiac G5 — all US models — plus the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit marketed in Canada and the 2007 Open GT in Europe.

GM fell less than 1 per cent to US$34.86 (RM114.38) at 4pm in New York. On Tuesday the shares tumbled 5.1 per cent, their worst one- day drop since March 2012, cutting the company’s market value by more than US$3 billion.

“The difference between 10 or 12 years, if I’m a consumer, doesn’t make me feel any better or any worse, necessarily, about what happened,” Kelley Blue Book’s Gutierrez said of the evolving timeline. “What’s important for consumers at this point is what GM is doing to make it right.” — Bloomberg##3226|Empty##3227|By Anshuman Daga and Yantoultra Ngui

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) – The co-pilot of a missing Malaysian jetliner spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the airline’s chief executive said on Monday, as investigators consider suicide by the captain or first officer as one possible explanation for the disappearance.

No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.

A search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering a area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.

Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane’s automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.

Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane – an informal “all right, good night” – was spoken after the system, known as “ACARS”, was shut down.

“Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape,” Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.

That was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 a.m., as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.

The last transmission from the ACARS system – a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane’s status – had been received at 1.07 a.m., as the plane crossed Malaysia’s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.

“We don’t know when the ACARS was switched off after that,” Ahmad Jauhari said. “It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through.”

VAST SEARCH CORRIDORS

Police and a multi-national investigation team may never know for sure what happened in the cockpit unless they find the plane, and that in itself is a daunting challenge.

Satellite data suggests it could be anywhere in either of two vast corridors that arc through much of Asia: one stretching north from Laos to the Caspian, the other south from west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra into the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia.

Aviation officials in Pakistan, India, and Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan – as well as Taliban militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan – said they knew nothing about the whereabouts of the plane.

“The idea that the plane flew through Indian airspace for several hours without anyone noticing is bizarre,” a defense ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, who are seeking to oust foreign troops and set up an Islamic state, said the missing plane had nothing to do with them.

“It happened outside Afghanistan and you can see that even countries with very advanced equipment and facilities cannot figure out where it went,” he said. “So we also do not have any information as it is an external issue.

China, which has been vocal in its impatience with Malaysian efforts to find the plane, called on its smaller neighbor to “immediately” expand and clarify the scope of the search. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH370 were Chinese.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had spoken to Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak by telephone, and had offered more surveillance resources in addition to the two P-3C Orion aircraft his country has already committed.

Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said diplomatic notes had been sent to all countries along the northern and southern search corridors, requesting radar and satellite information as well as land, sea and air search operations.

The Malaysian navy and air force were also searching the southern corridor, he said, and U.S. P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft were being sent to Perth, in Western Australia, to help scour the ocean.

FOCUS ON CREW

The plane’s disappearance has baffled investigators and aviation experts. It vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysian authorities believe that, as the plane crossed the northeast coast and flew across the Gulf of Thailand, someone on board shut off its communications systems and turned west.

That has focused attention on the crew. Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.

Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry, Hishammuddin said: “We are looking at it.” But he added it was only one of the possibilities under investigation.

Police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.

Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.

A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programs were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practice flying and landing in different conditions.

A second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group.

“Based on what we have so far, we cannot see the terrorism link here,” he said. “We looked at known terror or extremist groups in Southeast Asia. The links are not there.”

NORTH OR SOUTH?

Electronic signals between the plane and satellites continued to be exchanged for nearly six hours after MH370 flew out of range of Malaysian military radar off the northwest coast, following a commercial aviation route across the Andaman Sea towards India.

The plane had enough fuel to fly for about 30 minutes after that last satellite communication, Ahmad Jauhari said.

Twenty-six countries are involved in the search, stretching across much of Asia. Three French civil aviation experts involved in the search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic in 2009 arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to help.

A source familiar with official U.S. assessments of satellite data being used to try to find the plane said it was believed most likely it turned south sometime after the last sighting by Malaysian military radar, and may have run out of fuel over the Indian Ocean.

The Malaysian government-controlled New Straits Times on Monday quoted sources close to the investigation as saying data collected was pointing instead towards the northern corridor.

##3232|There’s a lot of talk about exploiting the US energy boom to undermine Putin and Russia. This boom may have profound effects in the long run, but there is nothing that can be done now that can materially harm Putin in to punish him for his anschluss in Crimea, or subsequent aggressive moves he may make.

Yes, the US restrictions on exports of natural gas and crude oil are economically idiotic, even absent geopolitical considerations. But even if those bans were eliminated tomorrow (a huge if, given he who sits in the White House-or golfs in Key Largo, as the case may be) Europe’s energy situation would not change one whit.

It would be possible to start moving large quantities of crude if the export ban were lifted, but this would be largely offset by a decline in US exports of refined products. A major effect of the ban is to distort where crude is refined, not the total supply of crude and refined products (especially in the short run). The major effect of the ban at present is to benefit US refiners who refine crude that is selling at below world prices because of the ban and export the products. One study estimates that eliminating the ban would drop world oil prices by cents not dollars.

With respect to natural gas the situation is even less favorable. Even if DOE granted all pending LNG export licenses, it will be years before product will start flowing. Cheniere received the first license, in May, 2011, and its facility will not come on line until late-2015 at the earliest. The company had a head start because it was converting an existing facility built to import LNG: other facilities will take longer to build because they are starting from scratch.

The long run impact of eliminating the export ban depends on the elasticity of supply of gas in the US. If it is very elastic at current price levels, then yes, once the ban is lifted world prices will fall substantially, and Russia will be hit hard by that. If supply is less elastic, the impact will be far smaller. The elasticity of supply will depend crucially on technological factors, including the suitability of new formations to fracking and horizontal drilling, the depletion rates of wells, and the rate of technological innovation. All of these factors are quite uncertain, and if the experience of the past decade says anything, it says be leery about making predictions about natural gas supply.

In brief: US energy export policy is stupid, but fixing the stupidity will have no appreciable impact on Russia for years.

Similarly, fixing stupid European policies on energy (e.g., fracking bans, massive renewables subsidies like Energiewende) should be done for reasons independent of geopolitics, and even if done tomorrow will have no material impact on European energy prices or Russian energy revenues for years to come.

The main way to impose substantial costs on Russia today via energy would be to impose trade sanctions. Given the fact that the oil market is essentially global in scope, and that coordinating a global boycott of Russian oil would be virtually impossible, natural gas is a more feasible target. Europe could boycott Russian gas unilaterally, and there is no effective way for Russia to sell that gas to Asia or anywhere else.

There is a substantial asymmetry here. Russia depends heavily on gas exports. Approximately 25 percent of the Russian government’s revenue comes from Gazprom. The knock on effect on the Russian economy would likely be huge, as severe fiscal constraints would likely put substantial strains on the Russian banking system.

Yes, Europe would be hurt by higher prices and lower consumption of gas. But gas comprises a far lower percentage of European expenditures than it does of Russian income, meaning that the hit on Europe would be far smaller. Moreover, some of the impact could be mitigated by substantially increasing coal imports, increased Norwegian production, and some diversion of LNG from Asia to Europe, especially to the UK (which has excess LNG import capacity and could use LNG to displace North Sea gas which it could then pipe to Europe). Moreover, winter is ending, and the cost of a supply interruption in the spring and summer would be far less than the cost in the winter.

But I doubt that is going to happen, because of another asymmetry. The asymmetry in political will. Old Europe has no stomach for a confrontation with Putin over Crimea, Ukraine, or much of anything else. (And yes, Donald Rumsfeld was an a$$hole-a claim I can vouch for based on family experience-but the Old Europe vs. New Europe formulation does capture an essential truth, especially where Russia is involved.) This lack of intestinal fortitude means that Old Europe-and especially Germany-is unwilling to pay any price to punish Putin. Talk is free, and that’s all they are willing to pay.

And don’t think for a moment that Putin hasn’t based his plans on exactly that calculation.

In an attempt to scare off any attempt at sanctions, Russia has threatened retaliation: Lavrov has told Kerry any such moves will “boomerang.” Other Russian officials have said that Russia can insulate itself from the west, thereby making it immune to any sanctions.

The retaliation that has been threatened includes expropriation of the assets of western companies. A quite predictable Russian reaction, and typically self-destructive. Any such expropriation would just cement Russia’s reputation as a lawless country where foreign investors rush in where angels fear to tread. Russian equity valuations would crater, and direct investment would too. Capital flight would accelerate. The costs inflicted on Russia would dwarf those inflicted on the US and Europe, and would last for years.

Other that that, a great plan! Another major asymmetry: any Russian retaliation would harm Russia far more than Europe or the US. Some boomerang.

It reminds me of the old joke about the genie who grants the muzhik one wish, with one condition: anything the muzhik wishes for he gets, but his neighbor gets double. The muzhik thinks for a minute, then says: “I wish that you pluck out one of my eyes.”

All that said, I do not think that economic sanctions in the form of boycotting Russian energy or other exports, or cutting off imports (e.g., of drilling equipment) are the most effective, or the least costly, way of imposing costs on Putin and the elite on whom he depends. As I have said since Georgia, 2008, the best way to attack Putin and the elite is to go after their money in the west. (This policy is getting widespread publicity now. I will lay claim to being a very early advocate.)

Such a measure is targeted on those who make the decisions, rather than Russia and Russians generally: as such, it could not be used by Putin to claim that the west was waging a war on Russia. Indeed, it could undermine his political support not just among the elite who would be paying the price for his adventures, but among the broader population who are already disgusted by corruption and who would be unlikely to have any sympathy for that corruption being exposed, and the ill-gotten gains being seized. The cost on western economies would very small indeed. It would represent a victory for the rule of law.

But this would impose some costs on some very connected people in the west. Moreover, precisely because it would strike so deeply at Putin it would cause him to lose his sh*t, and fear of that causes the Euros to shrink away from it in terror.

But this is something the US can pursue unilaterally. Yes, given that most dirty Russian money is in Europe or the Caribbean, these measures would be much more effective if the Europeans participated. But the US still can wield considerable power (note how it forced Switzerland to heel on tax issues-not something that I agree with, btw, just pointing out that the US has leverage) and indeed, the mere threat of exposing what it uncovers could make the Europeans think twice.

But again, there is a lack of will. Hope drives policy: “If we concede Crimea to Putin, he will stop.”

In sum, there is a powerful policy tool at our disposal. A far better tool than is available in most such circumstances. Other tools (sanctions) are more costly. Yet other supposed tools-increasing US energy exports-are chimerical.

If we’re serious, we’ll use it. But I have my doubts that we’re serious. If Europe (and to a lesser degree the US) has demonstrated anything in recent years, it is that they are past masters at kicking the can. Crimea, Ukraine, and Putin are likely to be just another can.##3233|1 Hour Ago

The consumer price index rose 0.1 percent, matching the January gain. Food prices, rising 0.4 percent, accounted for more than half of the increase.

Energy prices fell 0.5 percent as a drop in gasoline prices outweighed sharp rises in fuel oil and natural gas prices.

Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile month-over-month, core CPI rose 0.1 percent for the third consecutive month.

New US Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is expected to stick to the game plan when she chairs her first monetary policy meeting this week, further cutting back economic stimulus.

Yet, six weeks after inheriting former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke’s mantle, she is also under the gun to make a pivot in the way the Fed has been signaling its intentions.

Handled well, that delicate shift in how the Fed foreshadows an eventual rate hike could assuage markets.

Communicated badly, it could result in volatile movements and leave the new Fed boss on the back foot.

WEATHER IMPACT

The first meeting under Yellen’s lead of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), tomorrow and Wednesday, is expected to conclude that unusually harsh winter storms were mainly behind the slowdown in economic activity in December last year to last month.

The Fed has cut the program by US$20 billion to US$65 billion a month since the beginning of the year, and another US$10 billion cut could be decided this week.

Yellen already showed her bias toward the weather explanation when she testified before the US Senate on Feb. 27.

Taking note of the poor data, she said she “wouldn’t want to jump to conclusions.”

However, she added: “It is clear that unseasonably cold weather has played some role.”

A week later, the US Fed Beige Book survey of regional economies, important content for the FOMC policy meeting, mentioned the weather 119 times in explaining sluggish activity in much of the country.

REBOUND

A modest rebound in retail sales data last month suggested that there is some pent-up demand, and analysts hope this month and next month will show a rebound in the economy.

“We expect catch-up in March, leading to good momentum heading in to the second quarter,” Jim O’Sullivan at High Frequency Economics said.

Yellen, who has always stayed behind the scenes during her three years as Bernanke’s deputy, will face the media on Wednesday when she announces the FOMC’s policy decision.

With the bond-buying taper expected to remain on track, the challenge will be to explain how the committee will adjust the communication of its expectations: essentially, how it signals to the market when it plans to begin raising its key interest rate, held at a rock-bottom zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.

At the end of 2012, the FOMC set specific thresholds for when it could begin lifting the rate: 2 percent for inflation and a 6.5 percent unemployment rate.

Most policymakers did not think those levels would be breached until next year, and the current Fed outlook for a rate hike is later next year.##3237|Empty##3238|Empty##3239|By: Eamonn Sheridan

On March 5, Bouygues said it submitted an offer to Vivendi to start negotiations to merge Bouygues Telecom and Vivendi's SFR unit. The offer valued SFR at 14.5 billion euros pre synergies and at 19 billion euros post synergies.

Following this, Bouygues and Bouygues Telecom entered into exclusive talks to sell part of its mobile phone network and a portfolio of frequencies to smaller peer Ilaid SA's Free in a deal valued at up to $2.5 billion.

The deal with Free will enable Bouygues to alleviate anti-trust concerns on the merger between Bouygues Telecom and SFR, and aims to preserve strong, infrastructure-based competition in France. The sale of network and frequencies is conditional on the merger between Bouygues Telecom and SFR being completed.

Further, earlier this week, cable holding company Altice S.A. confirmed that on March 5 it made a fully financed cash and share offer to Vivendi for a combination of SFR and Altice's subsidiary Numericable. The offer involved a payment to Vivendi in the form of 10.9 billion euros in cash and Numericable shares representing 32 percent of the share capital of new Numericable-SFR group. It remains valid until March 14.

Bouygues said today that it is now offering Vivendi 11.3 billion euros in cash, equating to an increase of 800 million euros, as well as a 43 percent interest in the new entity. This new offer values SFR at 15.5 billion euros pre-synergies and at nearly 20 billion euros factoring in all the synergies.

As part of this improved offer, Bouygues' interest in the new entity following the merger would be 52 percent compared to 49 percent in the previous offer.

An IPO of the new entity is planned as soon as the merger is completed. This offers Vivendi an immediate opportunity to monetize its interest. Bouygues said it is committed to facilitate the liquidity of Vivendi's interest in the new entity.

The new Bouygues Telecom-SFR entity is expected to create a major French digital communications group with significant investment capacity, particularly for the roll-out of optical fiber and to develop innovation and quality of service for the benefit of consumers.

Bouygues is losing 0.70 percent in early morning trade at 31.80 euros. Vivendi is up 0.7 percent at 20.29 euros.

Business News##3242|Bank of England Governor Mark Carney pushed his message that there’s no rush to increase U.K. interest rates, saying there may be more slack in the economy than the central bank’s calculations show.



Speaking to lawmakers today, he said the amount of spare capacity is "at the upper end" of the 1% to 1.5% of gross domestic product estimated by the BOE in its Inflation Report last month. His comments underline a key area of divergence among officials, after policy maker Martin Weale said the level of slack may be overstated.



The central bank refocused its interest-rate policy, known as forward guidance, on spare capacity last month. The revamp came after unemployment fell faster than forecast toward the 7 percent threshold it set for considering a rate increase.



Noting comments by Deputy Governor Charlie Bean yesterday that the key rate may settle at about 2% to 3% once tightening begins, he indicated agreement with that outlook. The BOE’s benchmark interest rate is currently at a record-low 0.5%



Carney also said today it will take "several" interest-rate increases before the BOE begins unwinding its 375-billion-pound quantitative-easing program.



The strongest economic expansion since 2007 has shifted investor focus to when the BOE’s unprecedented stimulus will be removed. As part of the next phase of guidance, the debate on the timing of rate increases will hinge on policy makers’ assessment of slack in the economy.



##3243|New York - Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced massive hacker offensives last month, coming under some 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report said Sunday.

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.

While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.

Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.

The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said.

MtGox&39;s lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm&39;s customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that the company owned.

Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.

After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.

Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.

US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.

Japanese officials have said they were closely monitoring MtGox&39;s bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.##3244|Empty##3245|16.50 That's where we'll close up the blog for the night.

BoE releases previously withheld minutes on forex allegations

16.04 The Bank of England has just released minutes that were formerly withheld from the public from the November 14 meeting of its Court of Directors. In it they reveal that the Court- which comprises the governor and deputy governors plus nine other directors - discussed the "potential" for manipulation but that no members said they were aware of any actual or alleged manipulation. The Bank said that it originally withheld these minutes since, at the time, their release was considered to be "against the public interest".

But SAC Capital, the US hedge fund where two former employees have been found guilty of insider trading and a further six have pleaded guilty to the same charge, has not used its re-name to indicate a dramatic shift in its identity.

EU banking union faces delays as ministers fail to agree

15.16 The odds of a final deal on EU banking union between the individual member states and the European Parliament are narrowing as the meeting between the bloc's finance ministers drags on with no sign of a deal. The stand-off centres around the most controversial pillar of banking union - the single resolution mechanism - a proposed common fund which would be used to wind down or rescue ailing eurozone banks.

The idea is that the fund will be built up over the course of a number of years with levies charged on eurozone banks. But peripheral states like Spain are pushing for EU governments to provide guarantees that if a bank needed bailed out before the fund was fully built up, that it could still access rescue money. Germany on the other hand has refused to pledge any taxpayer support for the fund.

FCA is not investigationg BoE for forex rigging allegations

14.55 BREAKING: The Financial Conduct Authority has said it is not investigating the Bank of England for forex rigging allegations. Last week the Bank announced that it had suspended a member of staff in relation to its internal investigation into forex rigging over possible breaches of its "internal control processes".

The Bank of England will never unwind QE, nor should it

14.30 That is the bold claim by our very own Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, which he says Carney pretty much admitted himself this morning as part of his very long grilling by MPs.

He says Britain has just carried out the greatest victimless crimes in modern financial history. It is in effect wiping out public debt worth 20pc to 25pc of GDP – on the sly – without inflicting serious macroeconomic damage or frightening global bond markets.

Governor Mark Carney more or less acknowledged this morning that the Bank of England will never reverse its £375bn of Gilts purchases. Quite right too.

“Any unwinding of QE should come after several adjustments to rates,” he told the Treasury Select Committee. The word “any” tells us what we need to know.

This follows comments by Deputy Governor Charlie Bean yesterday that the Bank will “only contemplate selling back Gilts once the recovery is on a firm path.” He admitted that some holdings may never be sold.

The Bank has come a long way from the early days of QE when any such suggestion was treated as an outrageous smear. There was a mantra that helicopter money requires a hoover afterwards to vacuum it up.

But in a deflationary world there is no clear imperative to do so. The Bank can sit on its Gilts forever. These can be switched in zero-coupon bonds in perpetuity. The certificates can be put in a drawer and left to rot. The debt is eliminated in all but name.

Carney grilled on forex

14.12 After nearly five hours in the hot seat, it is over, and I'm sure noone is happier about that than Carney himself.

<noframe>Twitter: Louise Armitstead - Carney session with TSC ends after 4hrs40mins - phew.</noframe>

13.54 Things are getting heated now.

Back to those 2006 miuntes in which is says that there were concerns about market manipulation in the forex market.

Andrea Leadsom puts it to Carney and Fisher that those minutes should have set off alarm bells.

It is put to them that following the revelation of the Libor scandal the Bank should have gone back through minutes to look to see if there had been any concerns about rigging in other markets.

Fisher says those minutes "did not convey to me that markets were being rigged".

He goes on to say that it is not the job of the Bank to go hunting for manipulation, but will deal with it if it does come across it.

13.44 George Moodie takes his turn to ask questions, except they have already been asked so he warns that his could be a bit all over the place.

So Moodie says it seems as if Carney has managed to exit himself from the investigation and passed it over to the Bank's Court and also the FCA.

Carney responds to says it is the job of the FCA, as decided by parliament, that they investigate this.

This is extremely seriously. It is as serious as Libor, if not more so.

In my role as chairman of the FSB and as governor, I have had discussions with the heads of all other major central banks.

We are going to report to the leaders of the g20 on this issue, so we are taking it seriously.

He goes on to say again that the Bank is also addressing any issues internally.

We have spared no expense in conducting this and will spare no expense in completeing that investigation.

We will take the appropriate steps once we have all the information.

At same time will work at an international level to fix that.

13.34 Andy Love now asks Carney if the Bank can be confident that there wil not be any additional issues to come out from the forex investigation for the Bank.

Carney responds:

I am not aware of any additional issues but I’m acutely aware of our responsibility to complete a thorough investigation of all aspects of this issue.

It is incredibly important for the foreign exchange market and integrity of the bank of England.

I would not want to leave you with the impression that we have done something and will now relax.

Carney says again that the investigation will be very thorough and stringent to ensure that the Bank's integrity is not damaged.

We don’t just owe it to the people of ths country, but also to our employees who have acted with integrity and dedication.

We can’t come out of this with a shadow of doubt about the integrity of the Bank of England and we will not.

Carney says that while the investigation is taking place the Bank is putting in measures internally to reinforce the best aspects of the culture of the Bank.

13.27 Carney is asked for more details as to the grounds on which the Bank employee has been suspended.

Understandably Carney will not be drawn on this and says that the investigation was inline with the Bank's rigorous standards.

Again Carney is asked why the employee's line manager was not suspended or the subject of the investigation.

He answers:

We take the situation extremely seriously. We have conducted an investigation that has looked at not the actions of one individual employee but all relevant employees.

I make no judgement on that individual.

It is imperative we look at all aspects of the situation. We reconfirm the integrity and prudence and dedication of the ongoing employees of the Bank.

13.25 David Ruffley now asking the Bank to confirm when it first heard about the allegations.

Carney confirms his earlier answer of October 16.

Ruffley asks how it was communicated.

Carney says a colleague was informed but a market participant, who then told the governors who immediately met to discuss and then sought council within 48 hours.

Carney says the Bank did not carry out its own investigation before appointing Travers Smith as its legal council.

Ruffley asks why on February 11 the Bank's Oversight Committee took the lead on the investigation.

Carney explains that the first phase was to gather evidence, which he says was a very comprehensive effort to gather that - 14,00 emails, 21,000 chats and more. e pictuire as possible.

Once we came into possession of material which warranted intesification and led to suspension, the governors met, and at the next court meeting in March we told Court of our decision.

Then the oversight comimtte, without the executive, met immediately after that meeting and made the decision to take responsibility to investigation as they see fit.

13.16 So what's the plan for the Bank's investigation?

Carney says it will follow through the investigation, explain why if it finds there were failings and then take action to ensure those failings don't happen again.

One other thing we should do (may be others) – both for internal and external understanding is to more clearly establish what principles are around fair market.

It has to be a real market, not just about no market abuse but open to anyone who wants to be apart of it.

13.06 Carney is asked if the Financial Conduct Authority can investigate the Bank of England?

He responds:

It can and will investigate any individuals for any of these aspects (forex rigging).

Pat McFadden asks if the regulator can treat the central bank as it would any other high street banl:

Yes it can.

Indivuals at the institution under same scrutiny as at any institution.

Carney goes on to note that the Bank has no information that anyone from the Bank condoned, facilitiated or took part in market mainupulation.

He says the Bank holds it emplpyees to a higher standard than other institutions and following its review it had cause to suspend an employee.

12.54 Carney says the Bank first became aware that it could be involved in forex manipulation on October 16.

He says the Bank engaged legal council just 48 hours later.

12.49 Tyrie asks why the Bank released the name of the employee that has been suspended relating to forex rigging investigation.

Carney says the Bank did not release the name.

Tyrie asks if it was a leak.

Carney responds:

As you are no doubt aware, there is a very active press in this country, it;s a sign of a healthy democracy - people can speculate.

Carney goes on to say that he will not confirm if the person named in the press is the individual who has been suspended.

He adds:

I would take the opportunity that suspension is not a disciplinary action, it is an action to further the investigation that has been taken over by the oversight committee.

Tyrie asks Fisher if he considered suspending the employee's boss.

Fisher: No.

Tyrie asks why not?

Carney tries to respond but Tyrie says he wants to hear from Fisher.

Fisher cautious to say too much but says he has no reason to take further action.

Carney now allowed to speak. He says decision to suspend was taken by governors on the back of evidence found during the investigation.

12.43 We're back for the final part of Carney's marathon grilling session. This time it's on foreign exchange.

Carney grilled on economics of currency union

12.37 Another quick break- next up: how much did the Bank know about allegations of forex rigging?

12.30 Carney explains the concept of the "contingent liability" in any currency union - that is to say that a no bail out rule would not necessarily be watertight:

One of the risks is that there is a contingent liability that builds up e.g. eurozone. Everyone's familiar with events over last five years. There's no bailout clause in the Maastricht Treaty but, when push canme to shove, that was not credible. There were extraordinary efforts made by European officials to avoid [financial collapse in peripheral countries]. The issue for the rest of the UK would be: would it be credible to stand by if an independent Scotland were to be in fiscal difficulties? If it's not credible then the structure of the currency union is less than perfect but it's also taking on a contingent liability to the UK balance sheet.

These are all issues that need to be thought through in advance.

12.15 What if Scotland joined an EU banking union, asks Andrea Leadsom.

There would be advantages in terms of a newly established single supervisory mechanism. [But] the single supervisory mechanism of the ECB also relies on national supervisors for smaller local firms so there would need to be some capacity built up there.

It has the advantage of having a single resolution mechanism which solves one of the issues.

It does not have the advantage of common deposit guarantee scheme which would need to be built up.

Still to be determined would be the lender of last resort arrangements.

And asked whether a currency union with the EU would be viable, Carney says any currency union is "a bit like being pregnant" in that you can't be somewhat viable, you either are or you are not.

Does it make it more viable? There's a wide range of factors which would determine viability. Viability in a currency union is a bit like being pregnant. You can't be half viable in a currency union. You need all the components of a currency union. You have to look at the whole package.

12.09 He's also said Scotland would need to hold higher currency reserves if a sterling union was perceived as temporary.





12.03 Carney says it would be a "distinct possibility" that RBS would have to move its headquarters to England if Scotland becomes independent but remains part of the EU.

12.02 Would Scottish banks need to change their domicile to continue to be regulated by the London regulators, asks David Ruffley.

The key question is that it is not clear in the European context that the domicile of the major banks in Scotland would remain in Scotland given the location of head office like activities in the rest of the UK. It's not an issue at the moment. There are considerable value added head office activities in Scotland for those banks but a determination would have to be made.

Ruffley asks whether the PRA would require Scottish banks to bring their headquarters to England should Scotland become independent. Carney says:

If Scotland were not a member of the EEA that is a decision the PRA would have to consider very carefully.

11.57 He adds that an independent Scotland would need to guarantee Scottish-domiciled banks' English deposits under EU law.

11.56 Carney says the Bank would have to evaluate the suitability of Scotland's financial institutions for the continued access to the Bank of England's services.

How we do that evaluation depends on whether an independent Scotland was a member of the EU or EEA. If it were, there are passporting rights. If not we have to make an individual assessment of solvency and viability of those institutions. That deterination would be influenced by the credibility of the monetary arrangements.

11.50 Nor has the Financial Policy Committee discussed Scottish independence.

It is in part a product of the assessment of risk we have to prioritise. The arrangements, if this were to come to pass, there is a period of time over which arrangements would be developed.

The second point is that there is a referendum in September there is a clear view of all the parties in Westminster on the arrangements after that referendum which colours the prob of the types of financial stability risk that we could face.

If the circumstances were to come to pass that there were a prospect to the change of monetary arrangements in the UK that fell to the wrong side of the risks outlined in my speech, we would provide clear and public advice on those.

11.45 The Bank has not considered whether the composition of the MPC would change if Scotland were to enter into a currency union as this is a question of governance, so the responsibility of the Government.

11.43 Carney says Scotland's economy is more volatile due to its industrial structure, but is reluctant to predict whether it would be more or less volatile on its own.

There are a variety of issues around an informal adoption of sterling, not least the absence of formal lender of last resort abilities, deposit guarantee systems.

11.41 Do economies need to be well correlated for currency unions to work, asks Hosie. Here's Carney:

It's beneficial to the suitability of monetary policy of constituent members of currency unions. It's more difficult if policy is tight because of weight of activity in one part of the union versus another.

The economies are highly correlated. The counterfactual question is: To what extent could that change should there be a change in the arrangements between Scotland and the rest of the UK?

11.36 Stuart Hosie wonders how members of a currency union can ensure price and financial stability. Carney says the essential elements are:

- free movement of labour, goods and capital, adding that any element that detracts from those movements could lead to some misalignment in terms of economic cycles

- there needs to be currency arrangements with smooth fluctuation in some parts of the union. "Looking at federations, that central fiscal arrangement tends to be in the order of 25pc of GDP which provides some stabilisers".

- there can be disparity between members, but not too much.

11.30 We're back in business. Now Carney is being asked about the economics of currency unions with a view to the possibility of an independent Scotland forming one with the rest of the UK.

Carney grilled on inflation report

11.22 That ties up the inflation report section of today's session. The Committee is taking a five minute break. Next up, Carney will be flying solo, and facing questions on the "economics of currency unions".

11.20 David Miles has called an end to below-inflation wage rises. He says we're getting to the point where wage growth will start outstripping inflation, although he adds that while he is optimistic about growth, that he is less optimistic about making up for all the lost ground of the last few years.

11.15 After a fairly unexciting start to trading, the FTSE 100 has slipped lower and is down 19 points, or 0.3pc, at 6,670 in mid-morning dealings. Worries about the Ukraine crisis and poor Chinese exports data hit the market yesterday. David Madden, market analyst at spread-better IG, reckons both factors are continuing to weigh on sentiment:

Stocks have gotten off to a shaky start this morning as the mining sector is still fragile after the slump yesterday on the back of Chinese trade figures. The Asian powerhouse is depending too heavily on credit for it's growth, but who will fill the gap when their appetite for metals falls?

Traders are reluctant to go long on banks as they play wait-and-see for the Crimea crisis to play out; the possibility of a war is forcing dealers to remain on the sidelines.

11.08 Miles Fisher has admitted that recordings of the Bank of England MPC meetings are not kept - that the minutes are the only version of meetings kept for posterity. He says there were efforts do do so initially but that the "free flowing discussion" meant "it was very hard to transcribe the tapes in a way that made any sense in terms of written material".

He says he thinks it would "change the nature of the debate if people had an eye on the fact they were being recorded for posterity" and that he wanted to ensure that the committee meetings had a "genuine free flowing expression of ideas".

Tyrie asks Carney to revisit this issue and see if he can find a way to keep recordings of committee meetings.

<noframe>Twitter: Hugh Pym - Andrew Tyrie argues best for historians if recordings of MPC meetings are retained - asks Governor to consider transcripts of meetings</noframe>

11.05 George Mudie is digging into the early history of QE, asking the MPC members to confirm that it was pushed on the governor by the then-Chancellor Gordon Brown.

Miles Fisher says the Bank's asset purchases took two forms. The decision to monthly asset purchases for monetary policy purposes in March 2009 was taken by the MPC, with permission from the Government. He says that prior to this the Treasury asked the Bank ot undertake asset purchases but not for monetary policy purposes.

<noframe>Twitter: James Kirkup - Carney: There is no danger of my vote or anyone else&rsquo;s on the committee being influenced by the political timetable.</noframe>

10.53 David Miles says SME lending "slowly has improved". He says he has "detected more optimism among SMEs" in the last six to 12 months among SEMs, even though loan availability has "lagged behind the major improvement" for larger companies.

10.47 David Ruffley wonders what will most help solve the productivity puzzle.

Carney says it will be a mix of a "better functioning financial system, leading to better reallocation and getting births and deaths back up", a process of "learning by doing which comes as a consequence of rapid growth" and a "sharp pick up in investment over the forecast period".

10.39 John Mann wants to know whether Carney meant that labour in the North will undergo more recycling than that in the South.

The basic point I was making is we have seen less adjustment than we have seen historically in terms of new company formation and old company exit. That process adds to productivity and that adds to real wages.

10.38 David Miles says the "safe real interset rate" in the world has been steadily declining in recent years, and declined even more in the years after the financial crisis.

That's partly a reflection that people think the economy is a more risky place and they are willing to accept a lower rate on interst on safe assets.

10.30 Carney in a case of stating the obvious: "The Bank of England needs to get better at forecasting."

10.27 Tyrie asks Carney why he has said QE should not happen until interest rates start rising. Carney goes even further, saying unwinding QE should come after "several" rounds of interest rate rises. This is because, he says, it would be best to avoid a situation where the Bank would have to restart asset purchases.

10.26 Back in the FTSE 100, Sports Direct, up 2.5pc, is the biggest riser in the index, buoyed by the performance targets the company has set out in its executive bonus share scheme. Following Sports Direct's proposal to partner with Debenhams, there has been speculation the sports retailer might attempt a takeover of the department store group. Analysts at Espirito Santo today said:

What do the new debt and EBITDA targets imply re Debenhams and Sports Direct's (SPD) capacity to take it out? We only mention this as the market is bound to consider it. Debenhams has a current market cap of £970m, consensus EBITDA at Aug 14 of £230m and forecast net debt at that time of around £400m – so a current enterprise value of £1.4bn. Combined pro-forma EBITDA of £630m would allow net debt at 1.5x to reach £950m. So SPD would not be able to buy Debenhams for cash and stay within the debt target. This is all our estimation as SPD has not given any clue as to its intentions. So we think today’s news should be good for SPD (FY 15E EBITDA target 7-8pc ahead of consensus) and a negative for Debenhams.

10.24 An interesting line of questioning from Tyrie. "Is QE monetary policy?" "Is it the preserve of the MPC?" Carney answers yes to both.

My view is that the unwinding of QE is a monetary policy decision.

I think we should consult with the debt management office but with respect to the Treasury it's clearly an MPC decision.

10.19 Carney has also conceded that the Bank will not sell off all the £375bn of QE "as some will mature before the sale". He's also said that the Bank is "moving back" to the day when it will no longer need to provide forward guidance.

10.16 And the MPC's David Miles has admitted he has no special insight into the Bank's distinction between the 'output gap' and 'slack in the economy'.

<noframe>Twitter: Chris Giles - Hooray, David Miles says he is confused about the distinction made between slack and the output gap. Aren't we all</noframe>

10.12 Returning to the Treasury Select Committee, Carney has admitted that he was overruled by the MPC on publishing the output gap.

<noframe>Twitter: Philip Aldrick - Carney reveals he has been overruled on the MPC. 'I think we shd publish the output gap but I'm not in the majority on the cttee' he says</noframe>

BREAKING: Bob Crow, leader of the RMT union, has died

10.10 We're getting reports that union leader Bob Crow has died. He was 52.

10.08 Carney admits that the Bank's surveys have found that forward guidance was "much better understood" by businesses than by households.

10.05 He says the introduction of 18 economic indicators in the February inflation report was a result of the Stockton review's recommendations to improve Bank transparency. He also says that Charlie Bean's estimate that interest rates could reach 2 to 2.5pc over the next three years is "not unreasonable".



10.03 Carney says he has "absolutely no regrets" about putting in forward guidance:

In terms of the first phase of guidance we focussed on unemployment. That was a relatively easy call because it was the most readily identifiable, easily understood indicator of spare capacity in economy.

Thee key uncertainty around unemployment is the pace of recovery and productivity in economy. The unemployment rate has come down faster than we expected but we were careful to underscore that this was state dependent guidance not a promise of time.

I have absolutely no regrets that we are sitting here in March with amost half a milion people more in work and inflation at target.

<noframe>Twitter: Louise Armitstead - Carney under attack from MPs for switching explicit forward guidance for "18 new goal posts" and "fuzzy guidance."</noframe>

<noframe>Twitter: Louise Armitstead - Carney defends Fwd guidance: "I have absolutely no regrets that we&rsquo;re sitting here in March with half a million more people in work."</noframe>

09.51 Carney says that the pressure that rising interest rates will put on shaky businesses is no bad thing for the economy.mortgage costs will increase just using market interest rates

[With low interest rates, there have been] fewer births and deaths of companies and as a consequence less recycling of capital and labour and oopportunity. It's hard to quantify this but we think that's one of the causes of the weak productivity performance.

It's a necessary part of the adjustment in the economy. It is a factor which influences the pace and level of adjustment of interest rates.

09.48 Carney says the Bank's Financial Policy Committee is looking to introduce a mortgage affordability test that works in the potential for mortgage rates to rise nearer normal levels over the course of the mortgage.

09.40 Carney says the Bank does not have the tools that can directly affect the cash buyers' market in prime London property. Asked whether he is concerned that fast rising prices in London could spread to the rest of the country he said:

We have to be alive to that possibility. Our concerns centre around udnerwriting standards at present are quite high, vastly improved relative to pre crisis levels. Our concern is those standards would deteriorate, fed by general improvement in housing market. That's a pattern of behaviour we've witnessed over time so we're taking steps to ensure that doesn't happen.

Rising housing market in part because of dynamics in prime central london would encourage individuals to take greater risk without fully incorporating interest rate cycles that would transpire over the life of a mortgage.

What we are doing as the FPC is to look into [how many people would lose their houses if interest rates rise]. Not just aggregate numbers, but to using survey data and ultimately using loan level data to look at most vulnerable borrowers and how those dynamics move. Those are some of the early warning signs in terms of potential vulnerablilites in the housing market.

09.36 Martin Weale says the output gap is probably lower than what unemployment figures imply. He says that newly employed people, who account for the fall in unemployment, are typically paid 60pc of average pay since they tend to be young and because a spell of unemployment tends to carry a pay penalty. So if we're measuring output with wages, then we' might get a falsely low picture.

<noframe>Twitter: Sarah O'Connor - Weale thinks there is "something under one per cent" of spare capacity in the economy. Lot less than Carney <a href="http://t.co/uWUwdP3gLh" target="_blank">http://t.co/uWUwdP3gLh</a></noframe>

<noframe>Twitter: Megan Murphy - Martin Weale really didn't like forward guidance. "Had I thought there was a significant risk that unemployment would fall... (1/2)"</noframe>

09.35 He says he believes there is spare capacity in firms as well as the labour market but that the board differs in its views on this point.

09.33 The Treasury Select Committee has kicked off.

He starts by saying he thinks the output gap is "even higher" than 1.5pc - the estimate that the Bank gave in its February inflation report and that the equilibrium level of UK unemployment is "slightly lower than 6pc".

<noframe>Twitter: Ed Conway - Carney says his personal estimate of the output gap is at the "upper range" of the Bank's 1-1.5% estimate. Eg more room for economic bounce</noframe>

<noframe>Twitter: Faisal Islam - Carney personally thinks that the medium term equilibrium level of UK unemployment is "slightly lower than 6"...</noframe>

Industrial production disappoints

09.31 Industrial production rose 0.1pc in January, bringing the year-on-year increase to 3pc. That compared with predictions of a 0.2pc and 3pc rise respectively.

Sutherland hands in resignation: more details

09.26 James Quinn has more details on Sutherland's resignation letter.

His resignation has not yet been accepted, but sources indicated it is hard to see him staying with the Co-op.

In his letter, he told Ms Lidbetter that the mutual is "ungovernable" and that there appear to be people within the organisation who do not want his reforms to succeed.

His resignation follows news at the weekend that he was on course to make £3.66m as part of a proposed compensation package.

The Telegraph has learned that Mr Sutherland's resignation was discussed during an emergency board meeting on Monday evening, held by telephone.

No final decision was made as to whether to accept his resignation, with further discussions set to continue this morning.

It was unclear whether Mr Sutherland was at work at the Co-op's Manchester head office this morning.

On the board call, the directors agreed to put a series of proposals on corporate governance to the annual general meeting in May.

FTSE starts the day with a whimper

09.06 It's a fairly uneventful start to the day for the FTSE 100, which has drifted 3 points lower to 6,685 in early trade.

Also at 09.30 we'll hear how Britain's heavy industries fared in January. Economists expect output from industrial production - which includes mining, energy and manufacturing - to have grown 0.2pc.

At 10.15 Executive from Primark, Tesco and Sainsbury's will explain to MPs working on the Draft Modern Slavery Bill how their supply chains are free from slavery.

Then at 15.00 The National Institute of Economic and Social Research is putting out its GDP estimate for February.

In Brussels, George Osborne is joining the 27 other EU finance ministers for their regular Ecofin meeting - progress with an EU banking union is likely to dominate.

Corporate news round-up

08.42 Louise Armitstead has taken a look at this morning's company announcements in the City Briefing email (sign up here).

John Allan, chairman of Dixons Retail, has been hired to be the next chairman of Barratt Development. Mr Allan, the former chief executive of Excel who's also a director of Royal Mail, will join Barratt's board immediately and take over from Bob Lawson in November.

Inchcape has reported a 7.7pc rise in annual sales and a 7.4pc jump in pre-tax profits, driving its fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings. The car dealership, sells Mercedes Benz, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover in 25 countries, has described the results as "premium returns" although the figures are not quite as good as the market was expecting. Investors will be looking for an update on sales in to Russia.

Meg Hillier: Sutherland is 'jumping the gun'

08.34 Meg Hillier, Labour and Co-op MP, has criticised Euan Sutherland for 'jumping the gun' and points out that if he is embarrassed that his pay package was leaked then he does not have to accept it. Speaking on Radio Four, she said:

It seems to me that Euan Sutherland, he's got a timetable of things that have to be done but he's jumping the gun and compeltely ignoring the mutual ethos of the Co-operative Group and that is a bank that's owned by its members and that for me is a fundamental part of what the Co-operative Group is about and you can't have it both ways.

Strong leadership in a mutual model does not mean throwing a fit and throwing the toys out of the pram when something like your salary is leaked.

He needs to realise he's swimming in different waters from the PLC banking world and if he didn't want to take that on then he shouldn't have. We want him to sort out the group but to threaten to resign like this I find deeply unhelpful. It threatens the group more.

Mike Ashley in line for £65m pay scheme

08.24 Sports Direct has called an shareholder meeting for April 4 to approve a pay scheme that would award Mike Ashley, its majority shareholder, 8m in stock, worth almost £65m.

The sports retailer was forced to withdraw a similar scheme from annual meeting last September in the face of an investor revolt, led by the ABI and PIRC. In a statement today, Sports Direct has repeated its concern that Ashley, who owns a 71pc stake and is also the owner of Newcastle United, has not been paid since the company's listing in 2007, despite its market value soaring from £2bn to £5bn. "The board believes that Mike Ashley is central to this value creation," the company has said. The company says it has already secured the support of Odey Asset Management, the hedge fund run by Crispin Odey, but it ought to be braced for a tough match with others nonetheless.

Sutherland: Co-op Group is 'ungovernable'

08.02 More on that story. The BBC reports that in a resignation letter, Mr Sutherland said he believed the group was "ungovernable". It reports that the letter is understood to be a "back me or sack me move".

The letter comes hot on the heels of a row over Mr Sutherland's £3.6m pay package, leaked to the Observer newspaper on Sunday. The Co-op Group has defended its boss's remuneration - almost treble that paid to his predecessor - saying it was necessary as the group sought to recover from the biggest crisis in its 150 year history.

Co-op chief executive has 'written a resignation letter'

07.52 Breaking on the BBC is news that Euan Sutherland, chief executive of the embattled Co-op Group, has written a resignation letter. We'll follow developments as the story unfolds.

(NYSE: MCD) U.S. stores fell and the company’s global sales were rescued by sales in Europe. U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, while sales in Europe rose 0.6% and sales in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) fell 2.6%. Overall global same-store sales were down 0.3% in February, compared with sales in February 2013.

That is much worse than the January performance, where global same-store sales were up 1.2%, even though U.S. sales were down 3.3%. Europe and APMEA both grew sales in January by 2% and 5.4%, respectively, to offset the big decline in the United States.

U.S. sales were down due to “challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather.” APMEA sales fell as a result of weaker sales in Japan, the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday and negative performance in Australia. The United Kingdom and France offset weaker sales in Germany to post a slight gain in European sales.

The company’s CFO noted that year-to-date performance “will pressure margins in the first quarter.” That is not good news for shareholders.

What is even worse news is that the company’s priorities do not appear to be having a significant positive impact on sales. In the fourth quarter of 2013, same-store sales fell 0.1% and consolidated net income was flat. U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4% while rising 1% in Europe and falling by 2.4% in Asia. That is just about where the stores are at the end of February, and that is why the CFO is hinting that profits appear to be headed to finish no better than flat in the first quarter of this year.

Bank Clothiers (Nasdaq: JOSB) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Men's Wearhouse will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Jos. A. Bank for $65.00 per share in cash, or total consideration of $1.8 billion. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction.

Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have more than 1,700 stores in the U.S., with approximately 23,000 employees and sales of $3.5 billion on a pro forma basis.

"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Jos. A. Bank, which we believe will deliver substantial benefits to our respective shareholders, employees and customers," said Doug Ewert, President and Chief Executive Officer of Men's Wearhouse. "Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos. A. Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach. We expect the transaction will be accretive to Men's Wearhouse's earnings in the first full year."

Mr. Ewert continued, "The combined company will have the operational flexibility to successfully execute on strategic plans at both brands. We are excited by the opportunities this transaction presents and are confident that our combined best-in-class offerings for our valued customers will drive significant shareholder value. All of us at Men's Wearhouse have great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and are eager to work with Jos. A. Bank's talented employees. I am confident that, together, we will create a truly great company for all of our stakeholders."

Robert N. Wildrick, Chairman of the Board of Jos. A. Bank, said, "Our Board has been rigorously focused on pursuing a path for our shareholders that maximizes value creation. We have been committed to pursuing a range of strategic alternatives to achieve that goal. The transaction we are announcing today clearly reflects the success of our efforts, providing a substantial premium over any price at which our stock has ever traded, including a 56% premium since our interest in Men's Wearhouse became public last October, and allowing our shareholders to receive immediate consideration for their holdings. On behalf of our Board and management team, I would like to express our deep appreciation to our employees for their hard work in making Jos. A. Bank the great company it is today. We look forward to working together with Men's Wearhouse to ensure a smooth transition."

Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Combination

o Provides compelling value for both companies' shareholders: The combination provides Jos. A. Bank's shareholders immediate liquidity and substantial value for their investment. The transaction represents a 65% premium over Jos. A. Bank's unaffected enterprise value and a 56% premium over Jos. A. Bank's closing share price on October 8, 2013, the day prior to the public announcement of Jos. A. Bank's proposal to acquire Men's Wearhouse. Further, the transaction represents a 10x enterprise value to last twelve months ("LTM") Adjusted EBITDA[1] multiple (assuming an estimated $137 million of Adjusted EBITDA for Jos. A. Bank's fiscal 2013 ending February 1, 2014).[2]

Men's Wearhouse shareholders will benefit from approximately $100 to $150 million of run-rate annual synergies realized over three years, through improving purchasing efficiencies, optimizing customer service and marketing practices, and streamlining duplicative corporate functions. Additionally, Men's Wearhouse's vertical direct sourcing model will be leveraged to improve combined merchandising and sourcing across the combined company and rationalize inventory over time.

o Combined company positioned to succeed: The combined company will be the fourth largest U.S. men's apparel retailer with pro forma sales of approximately $3.5 billion. This transaction brings together a high-value collection of national and owned brands. Building on the two companies' complementary business models, the combined company will better serve an expanded customer base in more locations and optimize merchandising and sourcing capabilities.

o Smooth transition expected: Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank expect a smooth integration, as there will be no rebranding or remodels required – Jos. A. Bank's store banner will remain in place. In addition, the Men's Wearhouse management team has a proven track record of successful acquisitions, having integrated approximately 600 stores and over 7,000 employees in connection with its previous acquisitions of Joseph Abboud, After Hours and Moores. Men's Wearhouse expects to implement the best practices of both companies to drive further operational and financial success. Management will consist of the most qualified individuals from both organizations.

Terms of the Transaction

Men's Wearhouse will acquire Jos. A. Bank for approximately $1.8 billion in cash. Today, Men's Wearhouse announced that it has extended the expiration date of its tender offer to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, March 19, 2014, unless extended. Men's Wearhouse will amend its pending tender offer prior to that expiration date in accordance with, and to reflect, the terms of the Merger Agreement, including to reflect the increase in the purchase price to be offered to $65.00 per share and other changes contemplated by the Merger Agreement between Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank.

Jos. A. Bank's Board of Directors unanimously determined that the definitive merger agreement with Men's Wearhouse and the terms of the Men's Wearhouse tender offer are fair to and in the best interests of Jos. A. Bank and its shareholders, and recommends that Jos. A. Bank shareholders tender their Jos. A. Bank shares to Men's Wearhouse. Jos. A. Bank will amend its Schedule 14D-9 previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the recommendation of its Board of Directors. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including the valid tender of sufficient shares, which, when added to shares owned by Men's Wearhouse and its affiliates, constitute a majority of the total number of common shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. Any shares not tendered in the offer will be acquired in a second step merger at the same cash price as in the tender offer.

In conjunction with this transaction, Jos. A. Bank has terminated its agreement to acquire Everest Holdings LLC, the parent company of Eddie Bauer. As a result of the termination of its agreement to purchase Everest Holdings LLC, the terms and conditions of the offer were not satisfied. Effective immediately, Jos. A. Bank is also withdrawing its previously announced tender offer to purchase for cash up to $300 million in value of its common stock.

Financing and Approvals

The Men's Wearhouse tender offer is not conditioned on financing, and the Company expects to finance the transaction with a combination of balance sheet cash and committed debt financing from BofA Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The strong free cash flow generated by the combined company is expected to enable rapid deleveraging.

The transaction, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2014, is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act. Both Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank are working cooperatively with the Federal Trade Commission to obtain approval of the transaction as soon as possible.

Advisors

BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are serving as financial advisors to Men's Wearhouse, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP is serving as legal advisor.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Financo, LLC are serving as financial advisors to Jos. A. Bank, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Guilfoil Petzall & Shoemake, L.L.C. are serving as its legal advisors.##3253|Alibaba is set to undertake an initial public offering (IPO) in the US, the Chinese e-commerce giant confirmed on Sunday.

The move has been touted by analysts as the biggest potential IPO since >Facebook went public in 2012. Reports on Friday suggested the Hangzhou-based Internet giant had opted for the New York Stock Exchange after ruling out Hong Kong and London.

Alibaba owns two of China’s most popular online shopping services – Taobao and TMall – with a total transaction value of $163 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, according to Xinhua news agency.

In a brief statement on its corporate news Web site, Alibaba said it also might consider extending its public status to Chinese capital markets in the future to allow local investors to share in its growth.

The IPO would “make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals,” the statement said.

Estimates of the likely valuation have ranged from $55 billion to $120 billion.

Alibaba employs more than 20,000 people around the world and has more than 70 offices in China, Singapore, India, Britain and the US.

Taobao has more than 90 per cent of the China online market for consumer-to-consumer transactions with more than 500 million users, the South China Morning Post reported.##3254|Empty##3255|By Svea Herbst-Bayliss

BOSTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman renewed his attack on Herbalife on Tuesday, saying he has evidence showing the nutrition and weight loss company is breaking direct-selling laws in China, its fastest growing market.

The company said it follows local laws, and Chinese regulators have yet to comment on the matter.

Ackman, who has placed a $1 billion short bet against Herbalife, said the company is breaking the law in China by making recruits pay an entry fee and by letting distributors recruit new members. He also said the company is disguising its sales to distributors as hourly consulting fees.

He made the claim on a conference call that lasted more than two hours and drew some 300 listeners.

He was joined on the call by one of his lawyers, David Klafter, and Aaron Smith-Levin, whose OTG research firm conducted interviews with Herbalife distributors in China, and Ben Hakim, one of his partners.

“My understanding of the facts and law in China is yes, they are violating both civil and criminal law” in China, Klafter, a senior counsel at Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, said on the conference call.

Ackman and his team said this presentation is a first step toward bringing Pershing Square’s concerns to the attention of Chinese officials.

Herbalife said sales in China rose more than 120 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, the fastest of any region worldwide, contributing about 10 percent to global sales last year. The company has 200,000 sales representatives in the country and uses a “unique marketing program” to meet Chinese regulations, it said in its latest annual report.

Herbalife has said it remains confident in its business in China and said it is in compliance with local laws.

Direct sales models have recently come under fire in China. Authorities launched a probe into Herbalife rival NU Skin Enterprises Inc in January after state media published reports that it brainwashed its members. Shares of NU Skin, Herbalife and rival USANA Health Sciences Inc fell on news of the probe.

Ackman has accused Herbalife of running a pyramid scheme in which members make more money recruiting new members than selling the actual product. He made that claim public in December 2012 when he unveiled a $1 billion short position in the company’s shares. So far he has lost money on the bet as rivals such as Carl Icahn took the other side.

The company says its business is not a pyramid scheme.

Despite the paper losses, Ackman said he is sticking by his bet, showing no fatigue on the conference call where he answered wide ranging questions from listeners. In the 14 months since making his short bet public, Ackman said he has found fresh evidence nearly daily that is convincing him to stick by his original bet. If Herbalife ceased to exist right now he would make a few billion dollars, he said.

But there is no sign yet that Herbalife is near collapse, particularly since no regulator has yet commented publicly about its intentions in spite of heavy lobbying from Ackman.

Ackman also suffered another blow on Tuesday when lawmakers agreed on a broad outline to replace mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in which Ackman owns common shares and likely suffered hundreds of millions in losses. Recent sharp gains in those stocks helped Ackman’s fund return roughly 12 percent this year, far better than the average hedge fund’s 1.4 percent gain this year.

On Herbalife, he acknowledged that there is investment risk if regulators do nothing, a factor that he cannot control.

Many on the conference call asked why there are virtually no public stories about people who have lost their life savings on investments in Herbalife.

Ackman said civil rights groups have identified over 1,000 victims and that this firm has found roughly 200 victims. But he said many victims are reluctant to go public because they do not realize they have been cheated or are embarrassed about it. Also “a lot of Latino victims are undocumented and the last thing they will do is complain to the government,” Ackman said.

Fresh media attention, including a front page article in the New York Times on Monday, should help galvanize regulators into reviewing the matter, he said.

The Fed has said in its recent policy statements it won’t start raising short-term interest rates from near zero until well past the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%. That position hasn’t changed. But with joblessness at 6.7% in February, several officials have indicated in recent speeches and interviews they might want to scrap the threshold entirely or revamp their message in other ways.

Fed policy makers will debate the matter at their meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, though reaching agreement on a new approach could be a challenge.

The options some officials have mentioned include offering broad assurances, not a numerical threshold, for considering when to raise rates; citing a wider array of measures to consider when assessing when to raise rates; and providing more information about how much they would raise rates after they start the process.

“This is probably a reasonable time to revamp the statement to take out that 6 1/2 % threshold because it’s not really providing any great value,” New York Fed President William Dudley said in an interview earlier this month. The 6.5% threshold is “a little bit obsolete.”

2. Background: DJI Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) products are the most widely used non-program of record commercial off-the-shelf UAS employed by the Army. The Army Aviation Engineering Directorate has issued over 300 separate Airworthiness Releases for DJI products in support of multiple organizations with a variety of mission sets. Due to increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products, it is directed that the U.S. Army halt the use of all DJI products. This guidance applies to all DJI UAS and any system that employs DJI electrical components or software including, but not limited to, flight computers, cameras, radios, batteries, speed controllers, GPS units, handheld control stations, or devices with DJI software applications installed.

3. Direction: Cease all use, uninstall all DJI applications, remove all batteries/storage media from devices, and secure equipment for follow on direction.

All it took was a quick phone call to the Pentagon, and the rampant speculation falls apart into a CYA statement by an Army spokesperson:

We can confirm that guidance was issued; however, we are currently reviewing the guidance and cannot comment further at this time.

If you’re wondering what the hell that even says, it’s a basic the left hand didn’t know what the right hand was doing.

DJI’s Adam Lisberg on today’s events was the company was just as confused as the rest of us.

People, businesses, and governments around the world rely on DJI’s products and technology for a variety of uses including sensitive and mission critical operations. The Department of the Army memo even reports that they have “issued over 300 separate Airworthiness Releases for DJI products in support of multiple organizations with a variety of mission sets.”

We are surprised and disappointed to read reports of the U.S. Army’s unprompted restriction on DJI drones as we were not consulted during their decision. We are happy to work directly with any organization, including the U.S. Army, which has concerns about our management of cyber issues.

We’ll be reaching out to the U.S. Army to confirm the memo and to understand what is specifically meant by ‘cyber vulnerabilities.’

Until then, we ask everyone to refrain from undue speculation.

Yeah, it’s the Internet. Refrain from speculation? Say what?

Two paths here. The first is say there is a vulnerability of the DJI equipment. It would be a DOD-wide directive from the office of the Secretary of Defense, not the US Army.

The second path is this memo was written and accidentally released. It was never meant for public consumption. The Pentagon and DJI would work together to harden the systems for any classified or mission critical missions the products would be involved in.

It’s another lesson of asking basic questions. Don’t accept something as fact when a simple two-minute phone call gets you a confirmation and a whole lot of CYA. You can literally google the US Army’s Pentagon Public Affairs Office. Adding ‘Reportedly’ to headlines should not release outlets from basic reporting. If a two-man operation in Alabama can get answers, why can’t a VC-backed outlet get the same info?

We will update this article as more information becomes available.##3261|Empty##3262|U.S. stocks closed mixed today, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average incurring losses, while the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq noted modest gains.

Today's Top Gainers: Solar City, BG Medicine

Several stocks bucked today's down market on positive news, including SolarCity Corp. (Nasdaq: SCTY) and BG Medicine Inc. (Nasdaq: BGMD).

BG Medicine shares were up as much as 20% today after the life sciences company said late Tuesday that it received approval to continue listing on Nasdaq after proving compliance.

BG Medicine likely also received a boost after La Jolla Pharmaceutical welcomed positive results from a phase 2 clinical trial on chronic kidney disease. The study met primary endpoints using BG Medicine's BGM Galectin-3 test.

And Solar City Corp. (Nasdaq: SCTY) shares rose more than 5% after the solar company partnered with Best Buy Inc. (NYSE: BBY) to launch solar-panel consulting and sales locations in about 60 of Best Buy's store.

Today's Major Losers: Herbalife, Express

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE: HLF) and Express Inc. (NYSE: EXPR) were among the stocks incurring losses on top of the overall stock market slump.

Herbalife shares plunged about 9% after trading was halted as it said it received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Federal Trade Commission after volatile trading. The nutrition company said it will cooperate in the probe and said it is in compliance with FTC regulations.

And, Express shares plummeted more than 12%, marking a 52-week low of $15.51 in today's session on its fourth-quarter results, with both earnings and revenue falling below the Street view.

Express reported $0.57 per share in earnings and $715.9 million in revenue versus the Street view of $0.59 per share and $722 million in revenue.

WARSAW, March 10 — Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas poses a threat to European sovereignty, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned today amid rising East-West tensions over Ukraine.

“Germany's reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty. I have no doubt,” Tusk told reporters, days ahead of a Warsaw visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The top European economy buys around one third of its oil and gas from Russia and has extensive trade and investment links with the vast country to the east.

Germany has tried to defuse the Western standoff with Moscow over Ukraine, but analysts say its voice is muted by fears of endangering its economic ties with Russia.

“The Ukraine issue is a matter of the future security of the European Union,” Tusk said on a visit to a military base in northern Poland to mark 15 years since his ex-communist nation joined the NATO defence alliance.

The 28-member EU needs to review its energy policy, he added, ahead of Merkel's Wednesday visit.

“I'll be speaking very openly with Merkel, making it clear that the existing climate and natural gas policies risk posing a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole,” he said.

“I'll present our views on the political threats tied to dependence on Russian gas and money,” Tusk said.

“This, of course, applies not just to Germany, but in recent years Germany has been a strong example of this phenomenon,” he added.

Tusk said talks with Merkel would also focus on “how Germany could revise certain economic decisions, to avoid the paralysis of Europe at a time when it must act quickly and adopt a clear stance”.

Washington on Friday played down the risk posed to the European economy by Russia's threat to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, insisting the region had adequate stocks.

Russia is Europe's biggest single energy supplier and its natural gas pipelines mainly run through Ukraine, where some is used and some passes through to major Western economies such as Germany.

Washington, which backs Ukraine's interim government and opposes Moscow's moves to seize the Crimean peninsula, said any gas embargo would hurt Moscow as much as Kiev. — AFP##3265|It may be a coincidence that Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable is occurring during the lead-up to a midterm election season where candidates from both parties need cash to hold on to their seats in the Congress and Senate, but that very need for funds is giving the Kabletown Krew a good opportunity to grease the wheels on Capitol Hill.

Politico reports that, through varied means, Comcast has to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, which will likely have a hand in helping regulators determine whether or not the merger gets approved.

Additionally, 15 of the 18 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have received help from the Comcast coffers, including Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, Texas’s Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Two House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee may not end up being directly involved in the merger approval process, but they do have some oversight over Comcast and the cable/Internet industry in general. Thus, reports Politico, members of those committees are awash in Comcash, with 50 of the 54 members of the House committee receiving money from the company, and 20 of 24 Senate members feeding from the Comcast trough.

Comcast says that critics are misinterpreting their donations.

“Comcast NBCUniversal operates in 39 states and has 130,000 employees across the country,” a company mouthpiece tells Politico. “It is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process. The majority of our PAC contributions are to the senators and members who represent our employees and customers.”

And just think about it — if the deal goes through, Comcast will control an even larger customer base, meaning that more Senators and Congresspersons will “represent” Comcast customers, and thus need to be paid in kind.##3266|Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus thinks the $45.2 billion megamerger with Comcast is a win for Time Warner Cable subscribers.

Speaking at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this week, Marcus called the deal a "dream combination" that allows the companies to "innovate at a rapid pace."

I know what you're thinking: Of course he likes this deal. His company is getting bought out for $45.2 billion. And Marcus, who is paid in excess of $10 million a year, is the guy who spearheaded this tie-up in the first place. And there's little doubt he will profit handsomely from the acquisition.

But hear me out. He might actually be right.

As a Time Warner Cable customer for more than 15 years, I can attest that the service I've been getting for nearly two decades is nothing to write home about. And the bottom line is that the services that Comcast offers its customers today is simply better than what's available to Time Warner Cable consumers.

"Comcast is more innovative than any other operator when it comes to video service," said Erik Brannon, senior analyst for US Television at IHS. "By contrast Time Warner Cable has been less interested in things like converting analog subscribers to digital subscribers. And the implication is that on the whole their network is not quite as robust as Comcast's."

Even though Comcast hasn't made any promises about when or where Time Warner Cable customers will get Comcast's suite of services, it's clear these offerings will eventually make it to Time Warner Cable territory. And that could be a very good thing for Time Warner customers in spite of concerns that the cable giant is getting even larger.

"Some features and services people can expect relatively quickly after the merger," said Marcien Jenckes, executive vice president of consumer services for Comcast. "Today we're the leaders in terms of broadband speeds, TV content catalog and experience, as well as TV Everywhere. And Time Warner Cable customers can expect all of this over time."

It's hard not to be skeptical

I realize many consumers are skeptical of big mergers such as this one. And this particular merger is as big as they get. Comcast and Time Warner Cable are the No. 1 and No. 2 cable operators in the country. The combined company would control 33 million broadband connections. Together the companies will be in 19 of the 20 largest metro markets in the country. So it's easy to see why people are concerned and even skeptical of a deal that concentrates so much power in the hands of one company.

Comcast

Add on top of that, the fact that rates on expanded basic cable TV service have increased by more than 20 percent in recent years, it's hard to imagine that a merger of this proportion could be positive for consumers. Don't forget, Philadelphia-based Comcast and New York-based Time Warner Cable consistently rank at the bottom of most customer satisfaction surveys.

What many consumer advocates and lawmakers such as Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) surmise is that this must mean bad news for consumers.

"I think consumers will end up paying more," Franken said Monday on the "CBS This Morning" show, according to Variety. "There will be less competition; there will be less innovation and, worse, even worse service."

These are indeed legitimate fears. It's difficult to imagine that a merger of this size would actually lead to better customer service and satisfaction. I also am not so bold as to predict that prices might actually go down for former Time Warner Cable customers. In fact, Comcast's own David Cohen has admitted he can't make that assurance either: "We're certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly."

Still, the reality is that when you really look at Comcast's network and services, and even its pricing, compared to Time Warner Cable's services, an argument can be made that Time Warner Cable customers may have a lot to gain from being converted to Comcast customers.

"For all the complaints about how expensive cable TV is, Comcast has traditionally offered its customers the best bang for the buck in the industry," said Craig Moffett, an equities analyst with MoffettNathanson.

More value for your money, especially in video

When it comes to video service, there's no question that Comcast has a better offering compared with what Time Warner Cable offers today. From its video-on-demand catalog to its TV Everywhere service to a cloud-based user interface it's been developing the past couple of years, Comcast has invested heavily in revamping its TV service, and it shows.

"Comcast has really focused on investing in its network," IHS analyst Brannon said. "Time Warner Cable has been reacting to changes in the market too, but not with the same speed or veracity that Comcast has. And they've suffered as a consequence."

Specifically, Time Warner Cable has been less interested and less willing to spend money to upgrade its network to digital transmission. The result has been that Time Warner Cable offers fewer high-definition on-demand streams and its TV Everywhere product, which allows people to view TV on mobile devices anywhere, has been limited in terms of available programming.

Meanwhile, Comcast offers more video-on-demand content than any other paid TV provider in the country. This includes a library of movies and TV shows that totals more than 50,000 titles that are free or can be rented for a fee.

Additionally, Comcast is the leader in TV Everywhere. Through its Xfinity TV Go app, viewers can watch 35 live TV channels on their tablets or smartphones. This compares with a mere 12 TV Everywhere channels available from Time Warner. Comcast customers also get access to more than 25,000 on-demand shows and videos through the app.

And Comcast is constantly in search of new content to add to its portfolio. It recently announced it has struck deals with Sony Pictures and Lions Gate to start offering "House of Cards" and "Orange Is the New Black" to its lineup of on-demand content. Up until these deals, these two TV series were exclusive to Netflix subscribers.

But Comcast hasn't stopped there. It also has revamped its user interface and program guide based on a new cloud architecture it calls X1. Not only are the program guide and user interface much more interactive, which allows for more personalization, but the X1 platform allows subscribers to access TV shows and movies in new ways.

Comcast

For example, Comcast subscribers can view all live TV and recorded DVR shows on their mobile devices while in the home via the X1 platform. And they can even download recorded content from their DVR on their mobile devices for viewing outside the home. Comcast is testing the service right now in Boston and hopes to have it rolled out to the rest of its territory later this year.

"When we ask people to pay $70 a month, we want to make sure we're delivering a value," Comcast's Jenckes said. "In fact, our job is to deliver the best price value to our subscribers. And we are achieving that in ways that no one else in the industry can match."

Shooting itself in the foot

A lack of technology investment isn't the only reason why Time Warner Cable's service trails behind Comcast's. The company also has a history of contentious negotiations with programmers over digital video rights. As a result, the company has not been able to add as many channels to its TV Everywhere service or as many titles to its VOD service as Comcast. But there have been other consequences as well. A dispute this past summer over retransmission fees with broadcaster CBS led to a weeks-long black-out of CBS programming for Time Warner Cable customers. (CBS is the parent company of CNET.) Some 300,000 Time Warner Cable TV subscribers left over the debacle.

"The general feeling in the industry is that Time Warner Cable has been more resistant in terms of fee increases for content," Brannon said. "This reluctance has put them behind others in terms of their TV Everywhere offering."

Brannon added that companies, such as Comcast, which have been more willing to negotiate terms with content owners, have a broader TV Everywhere portfolio.

"TV Everywhere is an essential feature in all video carriage negotiations these days," he said. "There is an inherent trade-off between features versus cost, but all cable video services are under pressure to get these deals done."

Better broadband

Video isn't the only area in which Time Warner Cable customers can expect to see improvements. Comcast also has been a leader among cable operators in driving higher broadband speeds. It was one of the first cable operators to deploy Docsis 3.0 technology standards, which offer more capacity on broadband networks.

While Google has made a splash over the past year with its 1Gbps high-speed Internet service in Kansas City and is now expanding to additional markets, Comcast was the first cable operator to demonstrate a 1Gbps speed download over a traditional HFC, or hybrid fiber-coaxial, network. And at last year's National Cable and Telecommunications conference, the company showed off a 3Gbps download.

Today, the fastest broadband service Comcast offers widely is 105Mbps, which is about double the speed that Time Warner is offering in most of its market. That said, Time Warner is offering a 100Mbps service in Kansas City, where not-so-coincidentally Google has deployed its 1Gpbs service. Time Warner Cable also will offer 100Mbps service in Austin, Texas, where AT&T and Google have each pledged to build 1Gbps fiber networks.

Of course, some people have questioned why Comcast, which has shown off technology for achieving gigabit-speed broadband, hasn't offered such speeds itself. It's a valid question that I've asked myself. The company claims there isn't enough consumer demand. And indeed at the high prices Comcast and other cable operators are likely to charge for these super high-speed connections, that is likely the case.

But given the fact that Time Warner Cable has never been considered a leader in terms of broadband speeds, it's hard to argue that through its merger with Comcast, the market would be losing a competitive force that is driving the industry toward higher-speed connections.

Rather, I would argue that the telephone companies -- AT&T and Verizon Communications -- and to a much lesser extent, Google, are providing more incentive to all cable operators to increase their network speeds. Comcast actually faces less competition in its markets from Google and the phone companies than Time Warner Cable, and the increased exposure to this threat could spur faster improvement in the network.

"AT&T and Verizon are exerting tremendous pressure on the cable operators," Brannon said. "In many ways their technology is superior to the cable operators'."

If there is a downside to the deal for consumers, it's that one company would have unprecedented control over which cable channels can and can't be seen by millions of Americans, and even whether some independent programmers would be economically viable, Moffett said. This argument comes down to the fact that since Comcast will be controlling so many of the nation's TV subscribers and because it already controls a lot of the cable content via its acquisition of NBC Universal, the company will have much more negotiating power and in some cases control over programmers.

During his interview at the Deutsche Bank conference, Marcus laughed off the idea that a combined company with greater purchasing power would cause programmers to suffer.

"I just find these types of concerns ironic, especially when programming costs in recent years have risen to a level that is greater than what the consumer market will bear," he said.

There are also fears that the merger would lead to a similar level of control over broadband networks, which Moffett pointed out raises its own set of concerns surrounding Net neutrality. Again, the fear is that Comcast will control so much of the nation's broadband infrastructure that it will force content providers to pay fees or threaten to block or intentionally slow traffic. But Moffett said that even these concerns are likely overblown.

"It is the broadband concerns that will likely attract the more visceral reactions," Moffett said. "But truth be told, the rules governing anticompetitive behavior are probably already relatively well suited to prevent anything egregious, including almost any violations of Net neutrality, with or without Net neutrality-specific rules."##
